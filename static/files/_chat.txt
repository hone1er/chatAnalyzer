[4/24/20, 10:03:29 AM] Joe: Alright I guess I’m up. I was trying to go back to sleep for an more than an hour but it wasn’t happening
[4/24/20, 10:15:09 AM] Lore: Buenos días!
[4/24/20, 10:15:22 AM] Lore: haha poor joe!  sleepless like a little boy when he can't nap.. jjj
[4/24/20, 10:16:44 AM] Lore: In the end you have installed WhatsApp!  thanks for that, cute!
[4/24/20, 10:23:57 AM] Joe: Haha I told you I was downloading it!
‎[4/24/20, 10:24:23 AM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[4/24/20, 10:26:18 AM] Joe: Yeah I don’t know why I can’t just stay asleep 😴
[4/24/20, 10:27:52 AM] Lore: 😍 Are you there?
[4/24/20, 10:29:07 AM] Joe: Si
[4/24/20, 10:29:56 AM] Joe: Might as well get out since I couldn’t sleep I guess
[4/24/20, 10:30:29 AM] Lore: A que hora es normal despertarse allí? En España a las 7-8 significa madrugar, es para ir a trabajar. La gente normal, suele despertarse entre 9-10. A partir de las 11 es gente muy dormilona jaja. En Costa Rica la hora normal para despertarse era las 7 ( como 9-10 España, hora que ya hay sol y es más difícil dormir)
[4/24/20, 10:36:49 AM] Joe: I wake up with the sun no matter where I am hahaha

But I think most people here would say 9-10 is normal. I’m weird 😂
[4/24/20, 10:58:47 AM] Lore: Haha It's okey, It's you. The body rules
[4/24/20, 11:05:30 AM] Lore: Are you near the beach, right? What's the name of the place where do you live?
[4/24/20, 11:09:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeah super close to the beach haha. I have to drive nicest beaches but there are some decent small beaches I can walk or skate to.
[4/24/20, 11:09:37 AM] Joe: The town is called Kailua-Kona
[4/24/20, 11:30:11 AM] Lore: Que suerte, estás en el sitio perfecto. Eso de tener la playa tan cerca es un sueño! Ví alguna foto en Google jjj disfrútalo!
[4/24/20, 11:47:54 AM] Joe: Thanks! Before quarantine I was skating to the beach everyday and I was loving it. Definitely need a beach near by wherever I end up.
[4/24/20, 11:49:52 AM] Joe: Haha yeah Kailua is kind of a tourist town but it’s cool and really mellow compared to Honolulu
[4/24/20, 12:06:00 PM] Lore: the boy skates on the beach 🤤 haha.. and now you can't go skating?
[4/24/20, 12:07:48 PM] Lore: If it looks nice, although better without tourists, surely there are more solitary places. Honolulu seems to me too 😷
[4/24/20, 12:13:57 PM] Joe: I can’t skate into town where all the good skate spots are now and I can’t skate to the good beaches either but it’s ok to skate down the road. Skating the road is fine for exercise but I want to actually skate fun spots 😂
[4/24/20, 12:15:58 PM] Joe: I’ve never been to Honolulu but I doubt I would like it haha. Too many humans and it’s like a fake Hawaii. 

The other side of the island I’m on has the best nature spots. Beautiful waterfalls and forest  🌳
[4/24/20, 12:37:39 PM] Lore: fun places like skatepark?  where are you there is nothing fun you can invent?  wall, railings or something? 👀🛹
[4/24/20, 12:42:52 PM] Lore: haha good thought ..We look alike enough, If I go someday, I hope I can get to know part of the island with you, those natural places 🚐🗺️🏝️
[4/24/20, 12:46:10 PM] Joe: There isn’t much near me but the main road and some hotels. The fun places are just random spots downtown. Ledges, benches, rails, & stairs but they’re all in an area we’re not supposed to be.
[4/24/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: I’d love to show it to you anytime ☺️
[4/24/20, 1:20:30 PM] Lore: Ahhhh bien, ahora lo entendí! Jjj

[4/24/20, 1:25:44 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[4/24/20, 1:30:39 PM] Joe: So what time do you normally get up in the mornings(when you don’t have to do your course)? Do you like to sleep in?
[4/24/20, 1:48:48 PM] Lore: me gustan demasiado los gifts, lo siento..no puedo creer como me controlé, solo te envié uno jajajaja
[4/24/20, 1:53:20 PM] Lore: I love sleeping, but I also like to take advantage of the mornings, it is one of my favorite times of the day, breakfast and light. I usually wake up early, but I stay in bed quite a bit lazy. haha I get out of bed at 10.. it depends on the moment hahaha
[4/24/20, 1:59:54 PM] Joe: eso está bien, enviar todos los gifs jaja no se detienen
[4/24/20, 2:03:51 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I might stay in bed longer if I had a reason to hahaha

But for now I’m up with the sun and the birds ☀️ I would probably be considered a “morning person”

[4/24/20, 3:09:26 PM] Joe: cuidado, usted podría obtener lo que usted pide jaja
[4/24/20, 3:10:58 PM] Lore: Hahah I like "morning person"
[4/24/20, 3:11:01 PM] Joe: I don’t know who it was hahaha I must look like I smoke 😂 💨
[4/24/20, 3:14:32 PM] Lore: Jajaja puede ser, los pelos te delatan. Que rico, cuánto te costó? 💲
[4/24/20, 3:18:06 PM] Joe: It was free! They just gave it to me. It was weird but I’ll take it haha
[4/24/20, 3:18:08 PM] Lore: Usted es muy formal para personas mayores. Se diría "tu"en España, aunque yo digo  "vos", por que soy uruguaya .
[4/24/20, 3:18:51 PM] Lore: Free?? 🤨
[4/24/20, 3:19:05 PM] Joe: Muchas gracias 🙏🏽
[4/24/20, 3:19:19 PM] Joe: Yeah 🤷🏽‍♂️
[4/24/20, 3:19:26 PM] Joe: People are nice out here haha
[4/24/20, 3:19:34 PM] Lore: who gave it to you boy or girl? Hahah
[4/24/20, 3:19:57 PM] Joe: It was an older couple driving by in their car 🚗
[4/24/20, 3:20:10 PM] Lore: Vos tenés que decir "vos" como yo ...✌️
[4/24/20, 3:21:48 PM] Lore: Joe, so weird!!! Be careful haaha
[4/24/20, 3:22:22 PM] Joe: Am I going to get murdered?? 😱
[4/24/20, 3:23:24 PM] Joe: Cause to strangers on the internet and taking weed from old people seems like a good way to get murdered hahahaha I better shape up
[4/24/20, 3:23:52 PM] Joe: Cause talking to strangers*
[4/24/20, 3:33:20 PM] Lore: No digas eso!!!!!! Don't say that!!!
[4/24/20, 3:35:44 PM] Lore: Hijo de p... Jajaja
[4/24/20, 3:36:36 PM] Lore: I am less dangerous than the old couple! Haha 😇
[4/24/20, 3:37:06 PM] Joe: Hahaha alright maybe I’ll put the weed away but you’ll have to try harder to scare me off 🥱
[4/24/20, 3:39:56 PM] Lore: It's true, I didn't scare you too much.  But what if they then look for you to sell you and are secret police?
[4/24/20, 3:42:10 PM] Lore: if they put you in jail later I can't write to you! 🤹
[4/24/20, 3:44:31 PM] Lore: I know that nothing can scare you tough guy, but be careful just in case, few things are free.  Although that looks good, enjoy itttt, I would do it hahah
[4/24/20, 3:47:28 PM] Joe: I buy from my family so they can’t catch me haha 🚔
[4/24/20, 3:47:57 PM] Joe: I’ll try my best to stay out of jail. I’ve done pretty good at that so far haha

[4/24/20, 4:07:34 PM] Joe: 😂
[4/24/20, 4:08:28 PM] Joe: I want to ask you, what do you usually like to do for fun? What keeps you entertained?
[4/24/20, 4:22:11 PM] Lore: mmm, as you already know I really like nature, so among my plans is always to do routes with my dogs, with my friends we also try to spend time outside. I like to go to yoga or bikram classes..
[4/24/20, 4:23:08 PM] Lore: Design is very present in my day to day, I look at projects, inspiration, when I can go to events and talks. I also really like to do DIY, I spent time working in a workshop and I loved it!
[4/24/20, 4:30:22 PM] Joe: Nice nice. I like that you’re creative and that you love the outdoors so much. That’s really cool. Yoga is ok, I took a class once, it was a little harder than I though it would be but I was enjoying it by the end of the class.
[4/24/20, 4:46:51 PM] Lore: mirá te paso algunas fotos así es más dinámico jaja

[4/24/20, 5:06:41 PM] Lore: Sorry if I bored you with the photos, I had a good idea to combine text haha
[4/24/20, 5:07:00 PM] Joe: 🤔 what would I say then?
[4/24/20, 5:08:10 PM] Joe: I love the photos!
[4/24/20, 5:15:18 PM] Joe: I would send you some photos too but everything I have is just videos of me skateboarding or pictures of nature hahaha
[4/24/20, 5:18:26 PM] Lore: try to find some photos or video, I would like to see 🙂

[4/24/20, 5:33:26 PM] Joe: I shouldn’t have sent that last one  😆 I didn’t pick the piñata 🤷🏽‍♂️

Ok that’s all I have. Unless you want skateboarding videos. But I think I’ve embarrassed myself enough for one day.
[4/24/20, 5:33:54 PM] Lore: your piñata penis looks good on you! 🙊
[4/24/20, 5:35:42 PM] Lore: you're just grabbing her for the eggs 🤟
[4/24/20, 5:35:45 PM] Joe: Hahahahahah
[4/24/20, 5:40:17 PM] Joe: I was working hard that day 😓 haha
[4/24/20, 5:42:27 PM] Lore: I saw videos, you skate very well 🙌
[4/24/20, 5:42:41 PM] Lore: If someday you want ... you can send me a photo or video from there 😉
[4/24/20, 5:43:14 PM] Lore: 😂 muy muy duro!!!! Jaja
[4/24/20, 5:48:59 PM] Joe: Haha I’ll have to take more photos or videos just for you cause I don’t take them very often 😅 I’m camera shy
[4/24/20, 5:49:34 PM] Joe: Or just all around shy now that I think about it lol
[4/25/20, 12:35:54 AM] Lore: 9:35 haha.  I fell asleep yesterday!
[4/25/20, 12:40:12 AM] Lore: haha what an honor, perfect ... I hope those photos / videos!
[4/25/20, 12:44:13 AM] Joe: Buenos días!
[4/25/20, 12:44:34 AM] Joe: Yeah I figured you fell asleep. It was getting late there haha
[4/25/20, 12:44:35 AM] Lore: a shy boy, he's cute.  I don't know many like that haha
[4/25/20, 12:48:26 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s funny. I don’t know why I’m like this 😅
[4/25/20, 12:49:56 AM] Joe: How’s it looking over there today? Another beautiful day in quarantine?
[4/25/20, 12:54:22 AM] Lore: I guess at first, then when you meet someone, no.  Gastón is shy too, I the opposite haha ​​and We are brothers
[4/25/20, 12:58:25 AM] Lore: mmm haha ​​I have no course today.  for now in bed still hahaha..mmm Netflix, reading, yoga or dancing, not much else haha ​​eat, sleep, and look out the window
[4/25/20, 12:59:38 AM] Joe: Well it’s a good thing you’re the opposite! You’re very outgoing and you seem to know what you like, even if it’s on the other side of the world hahaha
[4/25/20, 1:01:08 AM] Joe: Feel free to send video if you decide to dance 💃 😝
[4/25/20, 1:02:51 AM] Lore: haha good perception and funny hahah
[4/25/20, 1:06:42 AM] Lore: Nooo, jaja muy ridícula. Hago bailes raros, mientras ordeno o hago cosas. Aunque el otro día, bailé una danza africana de YouTube... al verme en el espejo sentía una mezcla entre felicidad, vergüenza y risa jajaja
‎[4/25/20, 1:07:43 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/25/20, 1:10:16 AM] Joe: Hahahaha I would LOVE to see that someday!! 😂 😂 😂
[4/25/20, 1:11:56 AM] Joe: As long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters. I would find it very cute to see you laughing and dancing. I like that energy haha
[4/25/20, 1:15:51 AM] Lore: hahaha shit, well I'll try one day I promise nothing ...
[4/25/20, 1:17:15 AM] Lore: And what do you like to do?  besides skating that this is number 1 🔥
[4/25/20, 1:25:31 AM] Joe: Hmmm I like to program on my computer, I spend a lot of time learning about companies/business because I like to buy stocks haha, I like carnivorous plants like the one in my story from yesterday, outdoor stuff like swimming or hiking.

I also will get random hobbies now and then. Whatever I find fun and interesting in the moment, you know?
[4/25/20, 1:28:54 AM] Joe: I’m not the most exciting person I suppose 🤔 but hey, I am what I am 🤷‍♂️
[4/25/20, 1:46:47 AM] Joe: But yeah my most favorite thing to do is skating with my friends. 

If you get super bored today you can see my video part https://youtu.be/XzZcNds9KBo


Making these kind of videos is what my friends and I like to do
[4/25/20, 1:47:53 AM] Lore: If I find it exciting, you chose a profession that you enjoy with it, you like plants, outdoor sports, not in a gym..
[4/25/20, 1:49:13 AM] Joe: Haha ok good
[4/25/20, 1:50:17 AM] Joe: Oh and I’m way at the end of that video haha. But it gives a vibe of what we’re like I think. It was so fun to make. We’re working on another one now.

[4/25/20, 1:59:24 AM] Joe: Hahah muchas gracias! I should not have sent you that video lmao hopefully there isn’t anything else embarrassing in there I don’t remember. I don’t think there is much though haha. It’s super long. And you’ll probably notice when my part starts they put my name as Hone. That’s what my friends called me.

[4/25/20, 2:13:36 AM] Lore: Ya lo ví! Esta genial el video, parece muy divertido! Vos sos mejor de todosss jaja por eso te dejaron para el final como en los espectáculos 😂
[4/25/20, 2:19:23 AM] Joe: Hahaha! ☺️ thank you thank you. I think I’ve sent you all the video on the internet of me doing weird stuff. Glad to get that out of the way 🤣
[4/25/20, 2:20:16 AM] Lore: La toma del garage, vuelas alto jaja. No entiendo los trucos pero tienes mucho estilo! 🔥 Tu amigo de gafas es tu fan número 1 hahaha
[4/25/20, 2:24:27 AM] Lore: haha I already follow Benal😈
[4/25/20, 2:26:11 AM] Joe: Thanks, style is important to skaters so that’s good you can notice haha🕺

i have to tell Vince that he is my number one fan hahahaha that’s hilarious. He is definitely my hype man!
[4/25/20, 2:39:59 AM] Lore: Jaja sii mucho estilo Joe, me gusta! Jajajaja sii Vince es muy exagerado, pero muy gracioso! El vive mucho las situaciones cuando te sale un truco jajaja
‎[4/25/20, 2:40:24 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/25/20, 2:48:22 AM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 fuuuuck that is Vince hahaha thats my dude! He definitely makes things more exciting and fun. He just had his first kid recently though so he is taking it down a notch 😆
[4/25/20, 3:09:46 AM] Lore: Jajaj pero que edad tiene Vince? Es joven no?
[4/25/20, 3:10:11 AM] Joe: I think I’m going to try that mystery weed from the old hippies. Wish me luck haha
[4/25/20, 3:12:41 AM] Joe: He’s 28. I definitely didn’t expect him to have a kid but he’s a cool dude and he’s doing a good job being a dad or whatever haha. His daughter is a super cool and happy little kid. I love to see that haha
[4/25/20, 3:12:49 AM] Lore: Jajaja qué bueno, mucha suerte y buen viaje. Hacelo flojo
[4/25/20, 3:19:02 AM] Lore: super young, surely he is a good father seems good people.  Do you like children?
[4/25/20, 3:22:18 AM] Joe: Yeah kids are great. That’s one reason I really enjoy my job at the skatepark. We do those summer camps and working with the kids is really fun. They can be little jerks sometimes hahaha but for the most part kids I like children. How about you?
‎[4/25/20, 3:24:24 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/25/20, 3:28:19 AM] Lore: Yes, I like them, it depends on which one.  I love babies, the big ones if they aren't spoiled and dumb I also like them.  I don't know why but I enjoy more with the boys haha
[4/25/20, 3:29:34 AM] Joe: It’s true! Some of them seem like they just want to make you mad 😡 they think it’s hilarious or they want attention. Their games don’t work on me though, by the end of the week I usually have them on my side haha.
[4/25/20, 3:31:45 AM] Lore: 😂😂 Joe presidente!
[4/25/20, 3:34:11 AM] Lore: I would like to see these situations, but surely you can "chop" them when they don't come up with a trick and you do 👹

[4/25/20, 3:38:37 AM] Joe: Dude, I did have one kid last summer that was sooooo difficult though and I just couldn’t get him to do anything! The worst part was that he was at camp more weeks than any other kid! He really pushed my buttons hahaha that little mother fucker
[4/25/20, 3:40:34 AM] Lore: Hahahaha

[4/25/20, 3:47:10 AM] Joe: Hahahaha it’s a saying. Like he got on my nerves or he annoyed me on purpose
[4/25/20, 3:50:17 AM] Lore: yes hahahaha, but I don't think they are buttons or what?  this expression in Spanish is " no me toques los huevos" (huevos =testicles)
[4/25/20, 3:50:44 AM] Joe: Hahah shit
[4/25/20, 3:53:06 AM] Joe: Hmmm that’s closer “don’t bust my balls”. Similar meaning though. “Don’t push my buttons”, I thought that was common haha
[4/25/20, 3:56:37 AM] Lore: hahaha I can always learn something new.  I find that expression with the buttons strange and funny
[4/25/20, 3:58:06 AM] Lore: I can also say" You really push my bottons"?
[4/25/20, 4:01:14 AM] Joe: Exactly. Hopefully I don’t push your buttons though hahaha at least not yet

[4/25/20, 4:05:35 AM] Joe: Hahahah that’s ok, don’t be sorry 😂
[4/25/20, 4:05:52 AM] Joe: Aaaahhhhh

[4/25/20, 4:31:37 AM] Joe: Hahaha alright let me see...do you have a music app or I can send them from YouTube?
[4/25/20, 4:32:02 AM] Lore: YouTube/ Spotify
[4/25/20, 4:34:19 AM] Joe: Hmm ok. What kind of mood do you want? 😆 

I hate sharing music cause I feel like I’m being judged but I’ll do it for you hahaha judge away👩‍⚖️
[4/25/20, 4:35:05 AM] Lore: jajaja
[4/25/20, 4:36:22 AM] Lore: Be careful, I judge a bit if I don't like the music that happens to me. Don't lose points, I'll try not to..
[4/25/20, 4:39:02 AM] Joe: I like the music they play out here on the island 🌴 and mostly mellow stuff but I like a lot of different stuff. Depends on my mood haha

[4/25/20, 4:39:22 AM] Joe: 🙈
[4/25/20, 4:40:22 AM] Joe: J. Boog

https://youtu.be/m9LobsW8mLk
[4/25/20, 4:41:32 AM] Joe: Haha this is going to be my song for the next skate video https://youtu.be/itZe1pgsxag

Oh god you’re going to hate me after I send you music. Shit
[4/25/20, 4:43:20 AM] Joe: https://youtu.be/-knXBsbZRJA

Just so you know I never send anyone music. I always make an excuse or tell them I just like everything haha  this feels very weird for me
[4/25/20, 4:44:21 AM] Joe: And it really depends on my mood because I could send you something super upbeat and danceable or some mopey sad boy shit Hahahaha. Please don’t judge me too much 🙏🏽 😊
[4/25/20, 4:44:22 AM] Lore: chan chan chan!! mmm
[4/25/20, 4:46:31 AM] Lore: I like this !! At first from the photo it seemed that no.. hahah  but it sounds good and I hadn't heard music like that
[4/25/20, 4:46:53 AM] Joe: Haha what??? Is that bad or good.
[4/25/20, 4:48:07 AM] Lore: this yes, too! saved
[4/25/20, 4:49:28 AM] Joe: https://youtu.be/lmsbHGEB6UU
[4/25/20, 4:49:55 AM] Lore: Great, good choice !!!! I want to see that video, a preview, or when it's finished!
[4/25/20, 4:53:42 AM] Lore: hahaha I like this less....but thanks for sending me music, in the end you are going to make me feel special.
 (for passing me music 🤔😅)
[4/25/20, 4:54:03 AM] Joe: I think it’ll be coming out in February 2021 but I’ll make sure you get to see it somehow 😊
[4/25/20, 4:55:31 AM] Joe: Haha ok ok I’ve embarrassed myself enough for one night. I’m getting tired and making bad decisions like sending you music 😂 😂
[4/25/20, 4:55:36 AM] Lore: haha I love it! Of course the music also depends on the mood. When I do the course, I listen to music in Spanish very happy, so as not to get depressed Hahaha
[4/25/20, 4:55:49 AM] Joe: I’ll have to get some embarrassing stuff out of you sometime
[4/25/20, 4:58:33 AM] Joe: Haha that’s a good idea. I try to play upbeat stuff when I’m working too
[4/25/20, 5:00:02 AM] Lore: ey ey ey, no!! jaja soy sincera, las que me gustan te lo digo y las que no también. Las tres primeras siyy y ya me las he guardado en spotify! las dos ultimas menos. No me emocionan bastante las voces femeninas por norma general, excepto cantantes como Janis Joplin, Nina Simone, que esas me gustan mucho!
[4/25/20, 5:00:51 AM] Lore: I let you sleep, I guess you will be tired!
[4/25/20, 5:01:04 AM] Lore: siiii please!
[4/25/20, 5:02:35 AM] Joe: That’s good to know. I’m glad you got a few songs out of me that you like. 

Haha alright, Lorena. I’ll talk to you later, I’m going to bed. Enjoy your day. Un beso 😘
[4/25/20, 5:04:54 AM] Lore: Thank you, but tell me Lore (more friendly) sleep well Joe!!! un beso!! 😴
‎[4/25/20, 9:47:56 AM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[4/25/20, 10:03:40 AM] Lore: Ohhhhh
[4/25/20, 10:05:25 AM] Lore: Jajaja que lindoo
[4/25/20, 11:34:12 AM] Joe: Sorry, I had to go back to sleep for a little longer haha 😴 

He must really like my feet for some reason. He loves sticking his head in my shoe too. He’s a weird little guy.
[4/25/20, 11:52:05 AM] Lore: haha I figured you'd be sleeping a little more. I woke up and I had your message, I was in a nap, which the neighbors woke me up, at 7 it was agreed that the whole city should go out to make noise with saucepans to protest the government, but I didn't expect it and I woke up scared and with bad mood, many pots sounding loud hahaha
[4/25/20, 11:53:01 AM] Lore: cómo se llama el gatito? es muy cariñoso!!  es tuyo o de Angela?
[4/25/20, 12:00:32 PM] Joe: Hahahaha not the most enjoyable way to wake up 😂 

Is there any timeframe for when lockdown is over for you?
[4/25/20, 12:02:14 PM] Joe: His name is Oni and he is Ang’s cat. He loves to meow a little too much sometimes which can be annoying but he’s alright.
[4/25/20, 12:02:44 PM] Joe: He is like me though. Only super affectionate if he is comfortable with you. He runs away from strangers haha
[4/25/20, 12:25:41 PM] Lore: Today, we cannot go out, only to the supermarket. If you go out or are accompanied, the police will fine you...very strong! Today the president said...apparently on May 2,  We can go out individually to do sports for 1 hour, or take a walk 2 meters away..
[4/25/20, 12:28:58 PM] Lore: Yes, cats are annoying with that, like babies haha ..luckily the dogs in that sense are more pleasant
[4/25/20, 12:30:59 PM] Lore: haha Oni is the love of your life, they are the same. 💚Although that of running away from strangers, you do not apply it ..hahaha
[4/25/20, 12:32:52 PM] Joe: Damn that sounds rough. I wonder how long until there are zero restrictions? This whole thing is so weird.
[4/25/20, 12:34:04 PM] Joe: Yeah dogs are the best. I want a dog again soon!
[4/25/20, 12:35:39 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I guess that’s true. Good thing I don’t run away from strangers or I wouldn’t be talking to you ☺️

Wouldn’t have got that free bud the other day from the hippies either lol
[4/25/20, 12:39:03 PM] Lore: At first it seemed like a joke ... but we have been locked up for a long time, for me it isn't very hard, I appreciate being healthy and having goals. As for... the lies of the government, the manipulation of the media, the abuse of the police and the selfish society. They are all motherfuckers and they gross me out 🔥
[4/25/20, 12:42:19 PM] Lore: I also really want to have one, but if I work or travel, I couldn't take care of it, then I am holding on a little longer. Did you ever have a dog in your house? I at home with my parents, always since I was little
[4/25/20, 12:44:49 PM] Joe: I like your attitude 🔥🔥
[4/25/20, 12:45:20 PM] Lore: hahaha Joe, we strangers are looking for you, you are attractive to us!
[4/25/20, 12:46:53 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m waiting for the right time too. I need to settle in somewhere first. Wouldn’t be fair to the dog otherwise.

I had 2 dogs when I was little and i always loved having them around
[4/25/20, 12:48:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh noooo 🙈
[4/25/20, 12:50:25 PM] Lore: totally agree! do you like any breed or "chucho" ( dog without breed)
[4/25/20, 12:52:26 PM] Lore: 🤗 hahaha, que tal la marihuana? fue buena?
[4/25/20, 12:59:27 PM] Joe: Yeah I was impressed by the old people weed haha. Not bad! I always assume old people have bammer(bad weed)
[4/25/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I guess I prefer “chucho”(we call a dog without a breed “mutt”). 

I used to like breeds but breeding dogs is kind of weird when you really think about it. Trying to get certain features even if it’s not good for the dog is sad to me 😞
[4/25/20, 1:05:36 PM] Lore: they are the best, the most experienced.  haha imagine you in 20 more years 🤟
[4/25/20, 1:06:30 PM] Lore: I Guess I prefer "chucho" 💘
[4/25/20, 1:14:46 PM] Joe: I mean, they’re the way nature made them, and that’s fine with me. 

Does that mean you prefer chucho? It’s ok to like dogs with breeds, they are just not for me haha
[4/25/20, 1:19:59 PM] Lore: I love all dogs, some breeds seem great to me, like Kenya (weimar braco) super athletic, intelligent, affectionate.....but the chuchos are special, they are a mix, they have personality and they are usually in kennels. I don't like the business that is generated with breed dogs
[4/25/20, 1:27:36 PM] Joe: I feel similar about the business from dog breeding. I would never hold it against a dog for being a pure breed and would still love them but I couldn’t bring myself to seek out a pure bred dog when looking to get one if that means I’m helping those kind of businesses. 

My friend has a pure bred French bulldog and I have to admit that little thing is cute as fuck 😂 A little small though haha

Good to know we’re on similar page though haha
[4/25/20, 3:15:24 PM] Lore: yeah, well that we think the same about many things, the truth, even that the bull dogs are too small haha 🤭
‎[4/25/20, 3:18:52 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[4/25/20, 3:27:56 PM] Joe: 🤔 looks kind of flat. Is it a picture? Oh, or a book?
[4/25/20, 3:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha I really don’t know. What is it?
[4/25/20, 3:28:42 PM] Lore: Jajaja última opción, one more
[4/25/20, 3:29:50 PM] Joe: A letter. Written with a feather pen like it’s the 1700s hahaha
[4/25/20, 3:32:20 PM] Lore: hahaha good try, but no. Is hectographic paper
[4/25/20, 3:33:26 PM] Lore: I bought it for entertainment and to try out what a tattoo would look like haha
[4/25/20, 3:35:55 PM] Joe: 😂 I never would’ve guessed that!
‎[4/25/20, 3:36:47 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[4/25/20, 3:37:18 PM] Joe: Very cool though
[4/25/20, 3:38:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah you’ll get it down I’m sure.
You’re only seeing what some tattoos would look like? Not going to ink yourself up??
[4/25/20, 3:42:56 PM] Lore: I'll try again tomorrow.  I like to go with things clear if I'm going to get a tattoo.  I wanted an eagle on the leg, so I check that it looks good in that area, size, etc
[4/25/20, 3:45:25 PM] Joe: Damn that’s a good idea. I just go to my cousin and tell him the idea and we figure out hahaha

He’s really good though so it’s not like I’m going to my cousins house or something. He works in a shop
[4/25/20, 3:46:01 PM] Joe: https://instagram.com/misterbouncer?igshid=1h4f5s7bmlbd
[4/25/20, 3:49:46 PM] Joe: I have been wanting to get another one lately but I can’t think of what to get 🤔
[4/25/20, 3:53:37 PM] Lore: ‎This message was deleted.
[4/25/20, 3:55:11 PM] Lore: Tenés alguno ahora? Dónde te gustaría hacértelo?
[4/25/20, 3:58:03 PM] Lore: haha if it's good, I was watching your ig.  He will always use that clearly, haha.  mine is (silly?/foolishness?) but this way I go more safely, I hate to doubt and waste the person's time
[4/25/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Silly! But I don’t think it’s silly at all 🙃 that makes sense


I only have 4. Two on my right arm, one on my right shoulder, and a tiny B with a circle on my side that my friend did while we were drunk at his apartment hahaha that one is funny. It took him soooo long just to make the tiny B.
[4/25/20, 4:03:20 PM] Joe: I don’t really know exactly where I want the next one but I want one on my side wrapping around to the front a little, like the rib cage area I guess.  And more on my back would be nice. I take forever to think of something though
[4/25/20, 4:03:42 PM] Joe: Oh maybe the forearm too
[4/25/20, 4:04:04 PM] Lore: I want to see them, show them to me. (Hahha tiny B 🤭🥴)
[4/25/20, 4:07:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[4/25/20, 4:08:04 PM] Joe: https://www.instagram.com/p/B2O2f2YFE38/?igshid=1cdv0qszheabt
[4/25/20, 4:08:29 PM] Lore: On the side of the rib cage I like that place. Try the paper and so it takes less haha.  you can trace it from the internet and then try it, although later it has modifications

[4/25/20, 4:12:26 PM] Lore: haha it's like prison tattoos they have memories 🤭 tiny b is adorable
[4/25/20, 4:13:51 PM] Lore: Haha good idea, sure you do some more skate
[4/25/20, 4:14:09 PM] Joe: 🤣 muchas gracias! At the end of the video of me getting the tattoo you can see us getting ready to play that dice game too hahaha. I love my friends 😆
[4/25/20, 4:16:07 PM] Lore: it's fun, your roots ( tus raíces)
[4/25/20, 4:18:32 PM] Lore: haha the famous dice game!
[4/25/20, 4:18:57 PM] Joe: Hahah infamous
[4/25/20, 4:19:07 PM] Joe: ¿Y qué hay de tus tatuajes? ¿Qué tienes?
[4/25/20, 4:26:44 PM] Lore: Acabo de hacer una foto pero se ve un poco mal por la luz
‎[4/25/20, 4:29:19 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted

[4/25/20, 4:29:54 PM] Joe: Oh there it is never mind haha
[4/25/20, 4:30:52 PM] Joe: My friend used to love making these and would always try to get everyone to drink matte with him hahaha that’s a cool one
[4/25/20, 4:31:15 PM] Joe: Very cute
‎[4/25/20, 4:31:17 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[4/25/20, 4:32:17 PM] Lore: Si? Que amigo??
[4/25/20, 4:34:20 PM] Joe: Those are awesome and I love that they have meaning for you. 

The friend was someone I grew up skating with but I don’t see him much anymore. Interesting guy, he would always be making his own beer, wine, or cider and trying to get everyone drinking matte with him.
[4/25/20, 4:35:44 PM] Lore: Gracias!! 😘
[4/25/20, 4:36:25 PM] Lore: Ese chico parece interesante jajaja, si, si. De dónde es?
[4/25/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Muy interesante 😂 

I think his parents are Irish or something like that. He’s Super white boy haha
[4/25/20, 4:40:41 PM] Joe: He has always lived in the US though
[4/25/20, 4:42:09 PM] Lore: haha okey, super white is not sexy
[4/25/20, 4:43:24 PM] Lore: Mmm y como tomaba mate? Jaja que gracioso . A vos te gustó? Es amargo!
[4/25/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂
[4/25/20, 4:51:01 PM] Joe: It was good. I drink my coffee black so I kind of like bitter drinks haha. 

He had it in a cup just like your tattoo, straw and everything. He would drink it pretty often.
[4/25/20, 4:57:36 PM] Lore: 👏👏👏
[4/25/20, 4:59:56 PM] Lore: Mate es el recipiente, bombilla es lo que vos decís straw jaja pero es de aluminio y lo de dentro es la yerba 🍃
[4/25/20, 5:03:56 PM] Lore: Joe!  I'm going to sleep, have a good afternoon. Un beso 😉
[4/25/20, 5:04:03 PM] Joe: His straw was aluminum hahaha. I guess he knew what he was doing all along 😂
[4/25/20, 5:04:26 PM] Joe: Ok, sleep well. Talk to you later. Un beso
[4/25/20, 5:05:30 PM] Lore: 😘😘😘
[4/26/20, 8:55:49 AM] Joe: Aaaahh I’m awake 😓 I just can’t stay asleep haha


Dude, I finished part 1 of la casa de paper and that shit was wild 😂 that show is crazy but so good.
[4/26/20, 9:03:04 AM] Lore: Good morning pretty boy and early riser!
[4/26/20, 9:04:04 AM] Lore: Have you finished your first season yet?  good haha, tell me some new word!
[4/26/20, 9:06:44 AM] Joe: My new word is vergüenza because that’s what I feel every time I speak Spanish hahahah

I’m still practicing saying it 😂
‎[4/26/20, 9:07:47 AM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[4/26/20, 9:10:48 AM] Lore: Tenés que repetir esta frase
[4/26/20, 9:11:46 AM] Lore: " Yo tengo vergüenza, pero no me importa, porque Lore me enseña"
‎[4/26/20, 9:12:15 AM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[4/26/20, 9:14:27 AM] Joe: Hahahaha shit
[4/26/20, 9:15:06 AM] Joe: It sounds so nice when you say it. Alright alright I guess I’ll embarrass myself some more today. Why not? Haha
‎[4/26/20, 9:17:04 AM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[4/26/20, 9:17:11 AM] Joe: Aaaaahhh so bad hahah
[4/26/20, 9:18:15 AM] Lore: haha you're so sweet.  I'm also ashamed when I have to speak English...but I don't want you to be ashamed I want to teach you!!!
[4/26/20, 9:18:50 AM] Lore: 👏👏👏💚💚💚
[4/26/20, 9:19:18 AM] Lore: Genial! I love it!!
[4/26/20, 9:23:22 AM] Joe: 🙈🙈🙈
[4/26/20, 9:24:35 AM] Joe: As long as you can kind of understand what I’m saying, I’ll take that as a win haha
[4/26/20, 9:25:57 AM] Lore: I understand you perfectly, very well Joe, really!  I love the first seconds haha
[4/26/20, 9:29:07 AM] Joe: Aaaahhh haha I was too nervous when I started the recording 😂
[4/26/20, 9:33:19 AM] Lore: Me encanta!
‎[4/26/20, 9:34:24 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/26/20, 9:37:14 AM] Joe: Hahahaha
[4/26/20, 9:39:27 AM] Joe: At least I’m getting practice. That’s good. I’ve practiced more this week than I have in years. I’m starting to pick it up. 

When I started watching that show I could barely catch any words but by the end of season 1 I can understand a lot more. Watching that show is a great way to pick up spanish hahaha
[4/26/20, 9:45:19 AM] Lore: I'm so proud of you, and I have to admit that I am very happy to be part of this! ☺️
[4/26/20, 9:54:41 AM] Joe: Well, I really appreciate the lessons professor 👩‍🏫
[4/26/20, 10:45:52 AM] Lore: Jjj, entonces contame que tal la primera temporada, personaje preferido, personaje odiado,etc ??
[4/26/20, 11:00:42 AM] Joe: It’s was insane! My hands were sweating sometimes hahaha

So far I really like most of the people doing the robbery. Except maybe Berlin. And my most hated character is that Arturo guy. He’s a piece of shit 😂 😂 

But the professor, Tokyo, Denver, and Nairobi are my favorites I think. Helsinki is funny too.
[4/26/20, 11:19:32 AM] Lore: Jajaja te involucraste en la serie!
 Berlín es un hijo de puta, y "Arturito" otro hijo de puta pero tonto jaja es patético!  

Coincidimos en los personajes, me gustan los mismos, quizá cambio a Helsinki por Río jjj pero Denver, Nairobi y Tokio, mis preferidos!
[4/26/20, 11:30:15 AM] Joe: Oh yeah I forgot about Rio. He is good too. 

When the professor was about to kill the inspectors mom I was losing it hahahaha 

Plot twist around every corner 😂
[4/26/20, 11:44:50 AM] Lore: You still have good scenes. I already saw all the seasons. The last one was recently...jujuju I'm holding on so I don't spoiler 🤭🤐
[4/26/20, 12:02:37 PM] Joe: I have a lot to watch before I catch up to you haha. Yeah, don’t spoil 🙉🙉

How was today for you? Another beautiful day in quarantine?
[4/26/20, 12:20:51 PM] Joe: Ooooh I almost forgot, I need a message of you speaking english. 


"I'm ashamed, but I don't care, because Joe teaches me" same message I sent you but in English 👂
[4/26/20, 12:21:20 PM] Lore: because now in weekend it is longer, without hours I am a bit of a disaster jjj
[4/26/20, 12:22:01 PM] Lore: jajaja no 😭
[4/26/20, 12:22:37 PM] Lore: necesito que me lo digas, esa pronunciación no sé jaja
[4/26/20, 12:23:03 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s ok if you don’t want to. I understand. But I’m going to send a message of me saying it to you
‎[4/26/20, 12:23:16 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted

[4/26/20, 12:24:35 PM] Lore: Joe, I'm super happy! for a grade of the course of an exercise, a 10! haha that teacher is a very nerd and a bit demanding boy..
‎[4/26/20, 12:25:14 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[4/26/20, 12:25:30 PM] Joe: Congratulations! 🍾🎊🎈🎉
[4/26/20, 12:25:34 PM] Lore: JAJAJA aprendiste a usar gift bien!
[4/26/20, 12:26:58 PM] Joe: I love gifs hahaha but maybe I don’t use them as often as you 😂
[4/26/20, 12:27:16 PM] Joe: You’re the gif master
[4/26/20, 12:28:09 PM] Lore: The course has two very fat parts of modeling, I hate it. haha there were always errors, the models are easily deformed. Now in this third block, we are accepting the texture of those objects that we have made
[4/26/20, 12:29:14 PM] Lore: te lo voy a mostar!!!
[4/26/20, 12:29:48 PM] Joe: Yes! Show me!
[4/26/20, 12:30:13 PM] Joe: That’s sounds super complicated haha that’s so cool though
‎[4/26/20, 12:37:59 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[4/26/20, 12:39:13 PM] Lore: every time, you use more, ejem ejem.. hahaha
[4/26/20, 12:41:22 PM] Joe: That’s siiiiick!! How long does it take to model stuff like that? 

I’m jealous. I want to know how to do that now haha
‎[4/26/20, 12:47:55 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[4/26/20, 12:48:16 PM] Lore: and then it's to put that glass texture and render
[4/26/20, 12:52:19 PM] Lore: mmm I couldn´t tell you exactly, I know that many hours, because I´m learning and the time is relative...I have to see the explanation videos, then practice, do tests, etc.
[4/26/20, 12:53:42 PM] Joe: Cooooool haha I’m definitely going to learn how to do that someday. Looks like you can make some interesting stuff if you get good. 

What do you want to use the skill for? For interior design?
[4/26/20, 12:54:21 PM] Joe: That makes sense. I’m the same when I’m learning something in programming
[4/26/20, 12:57:56 PM] Lore: haha if it is very useful, I encourage you to do it! Yes, it is necessary for interior design, in a project you must deliver plans, documents in 2D (AutoCAD) and then in 3D (to see how it would look) there are several programs, but this is the most used..
[4/26/20, 12:58:39 PM] Lore: Exactly, I want to see things about you too!
[4/26/20, 1:04:03 PM] Joe: Nice. Definitely send more of your work to me if you need someone to show off to haha I’m very interested in it!
[4/26/20, 1:08:57 PM] Joe: My stuff is boring hahah. The last thing I worked on was a website so I guess I can show you that. I only did a few parts of it though. The top section and “the team” section. 

Cronycreative.com

Before that I was working on automation scripts/code that would complete teachers work logging grades. Can’t really show that one but it basically just made the computer automatically transfer grades from one website to another

[4/26/20, 1:15:28 PM] Lore: on the web, in the team part ... did you choose the design of the circles, typography, color, photos? sorry I don't know if I understood correctly
[4/26/20, 1:16:07 PM] Joe: No I don’t chose any design at all. I just build it to look like what the designer made.
[4/26/20, 1:16:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[4/26/20, 1:17:42 PM] Joe: So if you need a website you can draw up what you want or make it using a program called Adobe XD and I can make it for you 👍
[4/26/20, 1:18:03 PM] Joe: But don’t ask me to design anything cause I’m terrible at that part hahaha
[4/26/20, 1:19:48 PM] Lore: how is built? I have no idea, I'm really bad for this. haha
[4/26/20, 1:22:15 PM] Lore: Good team, when I decide to make one, you will be the one to make it for me !!! so I have an excuse to see you too
‎[4/26/20, 1:27:24 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[4/26/20, 1:28:34 PM] Joe: Good team for sure! Definitely hit me up when you need one. I’d be stoked to build one for you!
[4/26/20, 1:30:36 PM] Joe: Oh and I’d be even more stoked to see you 😂 😅☺️

[4/26/20, 1:38:14 PM] Lore: omg, how many codes, there is a lot of work behind! you can work anywhere in the world, and everything related to business needs a website!! You just need a computer!
[4/26/20, 1:40:14 PM] Joe: That’s the plan! And yeah, there is a lot of code to make a website.

I was surprised by how much it took to make something simple when I first started learning.
[4/26/20, 1:40:23 PM] Lore: Poco a poco... I get you to be more affectionate, hahaha
[4/26/20, 1:42:44 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh nooooo 😱
‎[4/26/20, 1:44:51 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[4/26/20, 1:46:19 PM] Lore: this is bad, right?
[4/26/20, 1:46:58 PM] Lore: haha ok, what did you tell me about the page?
[4/26/20, 1:47:05 PM] Joe: I was just kidding
[4/26/20, 1:47:12 PM] Joe: 🤗
[4/26/20, 1:50:32 PM] Joe: I said that to make that simple webpage I need to open this program and its all just a bunch of words haha
[4/26/20, 1:51:34 PM] Joe: I said too much in the video hahah. But basically it takes all the code I showed in the program to make the website I was showing
[4/26/20, 1:55:45 PM] Lore: yes yes, I have understood it and I have seen it clearer in the video 👌🏻
[4/26/20, 2:01:25 PM] Joe: Send music to me!
[4/26/20, 2:05:33 PM] Joe: It’s my turn to judge you haha👨‍⚖️
[4/27/20, 9:55:40 AM] Lore: Buenos díasss ✨!
[4/27/20, 10:14:12 AM] Joe: Buenas noches 🌙
[4/27/20, 10:20:30 AM] Lore: here it is 7:20 pm, it's still early jj
[4/27/20, 10:29:20 AM] Joe: Buenas tardes(?) haha

Only a few more days until you’re allowed outside. You must be looking forward to that.
[4/27/20, 10:30:36 AM] Lore: Buenas tardes, si! Jjj
[4/27/20, 10:31:22 AM] Lore: Aunque no se dice mucho, es más formal. Se dice buenos días, buenas noches, y por la tarde, hola, simplemente jaja
[4/27/20, 10:33:36 AM] Lore: Yes, I really want to go out, I really want to go to the beach!  At times I get tired of not having contact with other people or with nature...even something like going to the cinema or a theater
[4/27/20, 10:39:16 AM] Lore: Hahha uuhh, que música querés escuchar?
[4/27/20, 10:39:49 AM] Joe: I feel it. Your lockdown sounds extreme. I’m good with not being around people and doing my own thing but it’s nice to mix it up. 

What’s the first thing you’re going to do?
[4/27/20, 10:41:04 AM] Joe: Whatever you like haha I’m not super picky with music and I probably won’t actually judge you so send anything 🤙
[4/27/20, 10:44:49 AM] Lore: haha we have been locked up for 40 days, luckily I was fine all this time, well now I am too..but I want to return to normal life. There are bad forecasts. For example.. restaurants will have dividing screens.  You will have to go out wearing a mask, summer is coming soon and there will be no festivals, and the beach will be controlled..
[4/27/20, 10:48:07 AM] Lore: the first?  mmmm don't come back to my house all day haha. I will go see my family, I will take a long walk with my dogs, I will see my friends, we will have a few beers and we will smoke a joint in the river ☺️
[4/27/20, 10:52:56 AM] Joe: Damn that’s rough. I wonder when it goes back to normal completely
[4/27/20, 10:53:05 AM] Lore: I like everything, except electronic, pop, commercial ... I go by times, lately I listen to these songs..
[4/27/20, 10:53:22 AM] Joe: That sounds super chill. At least you have something to look forward to for now.
[4/27/20, 10:53:52 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsoiupLME-w
[4/27/20, 10:54:28 AM] Lore: this reggae version of the pink floyd song, I loveeeee it!
[4/27/20, 10:56:43 AM] Lore: Siiiii Joe, ojalá llegue pronto el momento!!! 🙏🏻
[4/27/20, 10:59:27 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mps6wvzxP2c
[4/27/20, 11:04:35 AM] Lore: haha the group that I listen to in loop, the criminals (Los Delincuentes ) hahah It is a Spanish group, from the south, here they are famous ... from years ago. his super happy music and his hearty songs! 
the song belongs to Delincuentes, but many famous musicians appear in this video. their look is rare, but it is typical here jaja informal.
[4/27/20, 11:07:45 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufS9fROh6Z4
[4/27/20, 11:07:51 AM] Joe: I like this one haha very cool
[4/27/20, 11:09:01 AM] Lore: these also in Spanish, Argentinos In Uruguay, you hear a lot, mixing with South American rock and reggae
[4/27/20, 11:10:06 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DLEF2faqY
[4/27/20, 11:10:56 AM] Joe: Pretty cool how everyone looks so “low key”(informal) in those last two
[4/27/20, 11:11:07 AM] Lore: I listen to this a lot too, it brings me good energy haha ​​completely different from the rest
[4/27/20, 11:11:28 AM] Joe: Haha good choice
[4/27/20, 11:12:03 AM] Lore: I listen to everything, what I like the most is rock, reagge, in English and Spanish, jazz too
[4/27/20, 11:15:08 AM] Joe: That’s a good mix. I listen to a pretty wide variety of stuff too. Sometimes I’ll like a song I would usually never like just because it was in a skate video haha so that leads to me liking some weird shit sometimes.
But if it reminds me of the persons skate part and gets me hyped I like it 🤷‍♂️
[4/27/20, 11:21:31 AM] Lore: Thank you, I passed you a rare mixture, but well haha ​​I hope not to be judged negatively!🙈
[4/27/20, 11:25:49 AM] Lore: Sure, each song reminds you of skate videos. haha that's great. When you discover new music that you like, send it to me. When I'm listening to my playlist, the hawaii song comes out hahah
[4/27/20, 11:31:27 AM] Joe: Haha I’m not judging you. I like your music but even if I didn’t I wouldn’t judge you for it
[4/27/20, 11:32:21 AM] Joe: Sure, I’ll keep you in mind when I hear new songs I like haha. The Hawaiian jams are so good. I love the vibe.
[4/27/20, 11:35:17 AM] Lore: 👏🙌
[4/27/20, 11:38:23 AM] Lore: Debe ser genial, cultura de playa, suena como todo super alegre!
[4/27/20, 11:39:04 AM] Lore: Y que tal el único de tu día? Estás patinando ya o tomando café en el jardín? Haha
[4/27/20, 11:44:08 AM] Joe: Today I’ve been lazy. I’m still sitting in bed with Oni 😂 

I finished my recent job last week so I don’t have much to do until I get my next job. Freelance life or whatever haha
[4/27/20, 11:50:16 AM] Joe: I’m about to get up and make some breakfast though then send some proposals for that next gig.
[4/27/20, 11:52:28 AM] Lore: haha what a good life Joe! When "I grow up" I want to be like you hahah
[4/27/20, 11:53:14 AM] Lore: I want a photo of you with Oni, please!haha
[4/27/20, 11:57:22 AM] Joe: Hahahaha you don’t want to be like me! 😂 😂
[4/27/20, 11:58:24 AM] Joe: Aw man he’s outside already. I’m in the kitchen about to make these pancakes 🥞 😂 


I’ll send you one later when he’s around
[4/27/20, 11:59:39 AM] Lore: Jajajaja
[4/27/20, 12:00:14 PM] Lore: Bueno, entonces sin Oni jajaja Tuya con los pancakes!

[4/27/20, 12:10:20 PM] Joe: I literally got out of bed and went to the kitchen so don’t judge my messy appearance too much please hahahah
[4/27/20, 12:10:55 PM] Joe: And somehow I got pancake mix on my arm in that picture 😂
[4/27/20, 12:12:00 PM] Lore: I like your appearance!  I like to see people's faces when they wake up, I find their eyes funny.
[4/27/20, 12:12:31 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja muy gracioso!
[4/27/20, 12:14:24 PM] Lore: I'd eat a pancake now even if it's almost night!  haha
[4/27/20, 12:18:02 PM] Joe: Breakfast foods might just be my favorite food so I could it pancakes whenever
[4/27/20, 12:28:07 PM] Lore: Jaja sí?? Con que los acompañas? Fruta, chocolate?
[4/27/20, 12:40:26 PM] Joe: Well it would’ve been some fruit but we’re all out 🙅‍♂️ 

So only plain pancakes for me today 😞 

I need to go to the supermarket and restock.
[4/27/20, 1:14:39 PM] Lore: jajaja Joe, el maestro de los pancakes!!
‎[4/27/20, 1:36:50 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[4/27/20, 1:52:04 PM] Joe: Well what do you like to eat? Are you a vegetarian or something like that? 
Not a big deal but I eat a lot of meat haha
[4/27/20, 2:26:28 PM] Lore: Omg I'm  tired, fumé un porro y bailé como una hora

[4/27/20, 2:33:09 PM] Joe: Haha super cute 😆 definitely don’t have to be embarrassed about that hahaha
[4/27/20, 2:34:45 PM] Joe: That is a long time to be dancing at home though hahaha. Must be good 🍃 😂
[4/27/20, 2:42:42 PM] Joe: You should definitely send more videos of you dancing 💃 Especially in your pajama haha 

Thanks very much for the video 😂
[4/27/20, 2:47:31 PM] Lore: haha I am a little spontaneous and impulsive 🙈 and at times I forget that you are a stranger haha
[4/27/20, 2:49:45 PM] Joe: All good. A lot of the people around here walk around town with less clothes on than that hahaha your pjs are cute that’s all 🤷‍♂️
[4/27/20, 2:52:15 PM] Lore: Jajaja gracias
[4/27/20, 2:55:45 PM] Lore: Ahora te tocará bailar para mi en un vídeo jajajaj
[4/27/20, 2:59:43 PM] Lore: Estamos en primavera pero en esta casa hace mucho calor, todo el mundo en pijama jaja hay muchos "memes" de eso
[4/27/20, 3:01:39 PM] Joe: Hahahaha noooooo aaahhhh maybe later for the dancing video 🕺
[4/27/20, 3:03:05 PM] Joe: Oh ok. How hot is it out there? 

It’s 70-85F here pretty much everyday.
[4/27/20, 3:03:59 PM] Lore: Jajajaja siiiii 👏👏🙌🙌
[4/27/20, 3:04:19 PM] Lore: Me gusta que no tengas vergüenza para las cosas que te pido, muy divertido jajaja

[4/27/20, 3:07:40 PM] Joe: Might as well have no shame when you’re asking me to embarrass myself haha. I owe you a video but I’m not promising when you’ll get it lol
[4/27/20, 3:08:19 PM] Lore: Muchísimo calor 🤯
‎[4/27/20, 3:09:09 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[4/27/20, 3:09:54 PM] Joe: Oh yeah. I feel like I haven’t put a shirt on in weeks hahaha 

Just shorts all day everyday
‎[4/27/20, 4:01:21 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[4/27/20, 4:01:57 PM] Lore: luckily you have a beach nearby!
[4/27/20, 4:10:09 PM] Lore: Ah, antes me preguntabas por la comida. No soy vegetariana, aunque me gustaría en algún momento serlo o hacerlo de manera más responsable ya que me encantan los animales. Pero en Uruguay la cultura de la carne es muy social también y a mí me encanta. Disfruto en realidad con toda la comida , carnes, verduras, frutas, dulces,comida basura/comida rápida, todo es rico jajaja!
[4/27/20, 4:25:03 PM] Joe: Yeah I love being near the beach in this hot weather. It’s a life saver haha. 

I hear you on eating more responsible/sustainable. Would be nice to give it a try. If anything just cut back slightly on the amount of animal product and when I do eat animals try to get stuff that is raised better than the big commercial farm animals.
[4/27/20, 4:33:09 PM] Joe: Ooooh I’m so excited I might get my infamous dice game working today hahaha. It’s still super ugly cause like I said I’m terrible at design but if it works that’s all that matters to me. 

Although, I might at least make the dice look like actual dice eventually. That’s a lot of work for a dumb game for me and my friends though 😆
[4/27/20, 4:39:16 PM] Lore: totally agree!
[4/27/20, 4:43:43 PM] Lore: Siiii???? Today is the first day that you are going to use it?  how is the game exactly?  I want to see a preview!  Good Joe, ánimo con eso!
[4/27/20, 4:47:19 PM] Joe: Yeah I just need to get one more thing working. The game needs to sign out users automatically when they close the game so I’m working on that. 


The game is called 3s. You roll dice and have to pick up at least one die after every roll. If you pick up a 3 it counts as 0 but all other die give you the value that you rolled when you pick it up. 


The goal is to get the lowest score by the end
[4/27/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: Your turn is over after you pick up all the dice
‎[4/27/20, 4:54:23 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[4/27/20, 4:58:39 PM] Joe: I’ll actually make it look nice and animate some dice if I get bored I guess but I didn’t see the need to impress my friends 😂
[4/27/20, 5:00:10 PM] Lore: haha ohh the emotion presenting your game. you have to select the lowest values ​​and the game automatically makes the sum. So it's luck, right?
[4/27/20, 5:01:35 PM] Joe: Exactly!
[4/27/20, 5:01:49 PM] Lore: I like the style, haha ​​it's like vintage.
[4/27/20, 5:05:10 PM] Joe: Hahah vintage. Yeah I’ll go with that description hahahaha
[4/27/20, 5:05:23 PM] Lore: I want to see the codes hahaha as they are so that the squares of the dice appear for example

[4/27/20, 5:12:01 PM] Lore: Uouo jaaja voy a ver!!!
[4/27/20, 5:12:26 PM] Joe: Dude give me all the design tips hahaha


Here you can look at it and try it out but it still has bugs and won’t log you out when you’re done but I’ll reset the server after so don’t judge harshly 👍

[4/27/20, 5:22:18 PM] Lore: Mañana con tus amigos y el jueves conmigo jajaj
[4/27/20, 5:23:44 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok sounds good. We’ll definitely play together. I should make a chat feature next. It never ends 👨‍💻

[4/27/20, 5:26:17 PM] Lore: Mmmm la puntuación final en grande y con sonido?  Okey o solo grande? Jaja
[4/27/20, 5:26:23 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I’m super stoked. I stopped working on the game for a few days cause I was frustrated I couldn’t get it working. Getting past this step was a big hurdle so I’m happy.
‎[4/27/20, 5:26:45 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/27/20, 5:27:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha I guess it could use more of a victory dance type of feel after the win
[4/27/20, 5:28:14 PM] Lore: Of course, you have to continue with it.  sometimes it is better to stop a few hours or days, then you will perform better
[4/27/20, 5:28:20 PM] Joe: Sound would be interesting just because I’ve never had to add sound to a site. Would probably be pretty simple 🤔
[4/27/20, 5:29:43 PM] Joe: I think that was it. I just needed a break. The solution in the end wasn’t even very difficult to fix but finding where the problem was in the first place was killing me. Had a eureka moment this morning while watching some coding seminar thing on YouTube haha
[4/27/20, 5:30:41 PM] Lore: the final size and sound can be more motivating for the player.  Sorry, I don't play anything, I think little desire to ignorance!
[4/27/20, 5:31:21 PM] Lore: 🔊🔥
[4/27/20, 5:33:46 PM] Joe: If official...Lore the web designer 👩‍🎨
[4/27/20, 5:33:55 PM] Lore: You aren't in a hurry either, mark the objectives that you would like to achieve.  You can also try it with your friends and they will give you an opinion!
[4/27/20, 5:34:57 PM] Lore: Jajaja 🙈
[4/27/20, 5:38:21 PM] Joe: That’s solid advice. I could really use a checklist or something when I do stuff like this. I usually just start coding without much of a plan beforehand and it gets me into trouble all the time hahaha
[4/27/20, 5:43:12 PM] Lore: any code you need I help you fix the problem, just ask me 👩‍💻😏
[4/27/20, 5:46:11 PM] Lore: haha ánimo!!! 💪 surely you will learn new things and have a good time with your friends! 
 I'm going to sleep we'll talk tomorrow. Un beso, buenas noches!! 😘
[4/27/20, 5:48:07 PM] Joe: Muchas gracias!! Buenas noches! Un beso 😘
[4/28/20, 11:01:45 AM] Joe: Hola! Hope you had a good day! I’m just about to get mine started haha. 

This 12 hour time difference is weird 😂
[4/28/20, 11:19:58 AM] Lore: Buenos días! Jaja sí, es rara. Estoy acostumbrada. Uruguay con España 5 horas, Costa Rica con España 8 horas y Hawaii con España 12, es lo máximo jajaja

[4/28/20, 11:24:52 AM] Lore: Do you have pancakes today?
[4/28/20, 11:27:10 AM] Joe: Mmmm that looks good. No I had eggs and toast today haha

How’d your two exercises go? Is it getting harder as the class goes on?
[4/28/20, 11:29:45 AM] Joe: I’m only used to 3 hour difference between Hawaii and California haha
[4/28/20, 11:54:50 AM] Lore: Hmm, this part gets more fun. materials, more realistic images remain. Before, I was modeling, and things get deformed easily. I was hysterical haha
[4/28/20, 11:55:46 AM] Lore: In these We go faster, I am motivated to insist Sandra to continue, with a beer haha
[4/28/20, 11:59:46 AM] Lore: very few...with me it is beastly! haha
[4/28/20, 12:01:24 PM] Lore: and what are you doing in the house are you alone or does Angela work? Does anyone else live?
[4/28/20, 12:11:30 PM] Joe: Glad it’s getting more fun. Now you can start making the cool shit haha. 

Beer is a great motivator 😂
[4/28/20, 12:13:21 PM] Joe: Usually my sister works in town at the Pearl Factory but town is shut down so she is home for now. 


They extended our quarantine to the end of May, though they’re relaxing the rules a bit more soon.
[4/28/20, 12:15:00 PM] Joe: It’s just me and my sister here but my cousins and other family are super close by. Within walking distance. 

How about you? Is it just you and your roommate in Madrid? Do you have family near you?
‎[4/28/20, 12:15:51 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[4/28/20, 12:27:25 PM] Lore: Yes, although lately I am upset I have bought a new one. and the can is heavier than normal ... so I think there is more beer left, and the can is empty. putos ratas!!
[4/28/20, 12:28:11 PM] Lore: cool shit jajaja
[4/28/20, 12:29:06 PM] Joe: Hahahaha that probably translates weird. Whoops 😂
[4/28/20, 12:29:29 PM] Lore: Oniiiii, jaja que bonito es!!!!
[4/28/20, 12:30:44 PM] Lore: which? hahaha cool shit no?
[4/28/20, 12:31:08 PM] Joe: Yeah. Cool shit 😎 💩
[4/28/20, 12:33:11 PM] Lore: Oni loves you, sleeps with you too? or is he just going to say good morning?
[4/28/20, 12:34:24 PM] Lore: It sounds weird, but I got it!! the description is perfect for 3ds Max hahah
[4/28/20, 12:36:51 PM] Lore: Ohhhh, quarantine times there too! But the police don't tell you anything about going to the beach, right? We believe that in mid-May, We will be able to go outside!
[4/28/20, 12:39:35 PM] Joe: He just wants attention haha. He does like to sleep with me in my bed too. 


They’re fine with you being out but you can’t sit at the beach on a towel or chair. I usually look like I’m on the move when I’m outside so they think I’m just exercising. 

I saw the police taking to two old white ladies that were sitting at a bench near a beach. They were saying they couldn’t be there, while all these other people were getting ready to go out in the water surfing haha
[4/28/20, 12:40:18 PM] Joe: Police talking to* not taking haha
[4/28/20, 12:40:48 PM] Lore: Mucha familia en Hawaii!  eso es genial..! yo vivo en un piso compartido, somos 3, pero cada una tiene su habitación. (flatmate no?) vivo con Sandra ( ella es compañera del trabajo, pero nos hicimos super amigas y buscamos una casa juntas),la otra chica con la que vivimos, se llama Nuria, ella ya vivia en esta casa, tiene 44 años y esta muyyyyy loca, de verdad!
[4/28/20, 12:47:25 PM] Joe: Haha I feel like people having a crazy older flatmate is super common for some reason. 

I know a lot of people that have one of those 😂 

Sounds like a nice setup though, especially having someone you’re friends with there with you.
[4/28/20, 12:48:39 PM] Lore: Oni, in the end he goes to california!!!  Do you like sunbathing on the beach?
[4/28/20, 12:49:39 PM] Lore: Could you send me a video skating down the road on the way to the beach, it would be the closest thing to vacation right now for me hahaha
[4/28/20, 12:50:57 PM] Joe: I wish! My sister wouldn’t like that 😂 

Sunbathing is ok but i like to play in the water or build stupid stuff in the sand. More fun that way haha
[4/28/20, 12:51:38 PM] Lore: Of course, for older people it is much more dangerous, it is deadly! old white ladies? hahah what do you mean?
[4/28/20, 12:56:22 PM] Joe: I mean they were old and white and most likely not from around here.

It was only noticeable because they’re were sat on the bench near a bunch of super brown Hawaiian dudes that were getting ready to surf.
[4/28/20, 12:57:00 PM] Lore: haha yesss, although age isn't important. the important thing is how unbalanced it is... It seems normal, but it is not. He says he is an athlete, and not a day has gone by since we came to live here. haha and she is also very envious, she can't stand that sandra and I get along so well..
[4/28/20, 12:57:58 PM] Lore: build stupid stuff in the sand hahaha like a little boy.. ohh jajaja
[4/28/20, 12:58:25 PM] Joe: 🤗

[4/28/20, 1:05:22 PM] Lore: hahaha I imagine the situation, walking on the beach and seeing a boy so concentrated making his chair with footrests 😂  It's your family o were you alone?
[4/28/20, 1:07:55 PM] Joe: I was with some family. 

That’s my aunt, cousin(laying down), mom, sister, and my sisters friend.

[4/28/20, 1:52:55 PM] Lore: lindo!!!
[4/28/20, 1:54:27 PM] Lore: haha buuuubu nooo, I like to see you in paradise!
[4/28/20, 1:58:06 PM] Joe: Haha there is lots of people but all my favorite places are where they don’t like to go 😂 


The nice beach probably has a lot of people. At least it did over the weekend.
[4/28/20, 1:58:25 PM] Joe: Noooo just saying I have to walk over the lava and sorry it’s shaky haha

[4/28/20, 2:42:38 PM] Lore: You're going to kill me
[4/28/20, 2:44:28 PM] Joe: Haha why do you say that I’m going to kill you?
[4/28/20, 2:44:47 PM] Joe: Nunca
[4/28/20, 2:44:53 PM] Lore: Esos lugares son increíbles, son demasiado lindos!!!!
[4/28/20, 2:46:51 PM] Lore: Me gusta ver los vídeos con el sonido de las ruedas del patín, jaja libre
[4/28/20, 2:46:54 PM] Joe: Oh cause the places are too cute? Haha just come and visit  🙃
[4/28/20, 2:47:28 PM] Lore: Jaja sí es una expresión en español," me vas a matar!!!"
[4/28/20, 2:47:51 PM] Lore: Por ejemplo cuando algo es demasiado lindo, y puede darme envidia jaja
[4/28/20, 2:48:41 PM] Lore: 😍😍😍😍😍
‎[4/28/20, 2:49:49 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/28/20, 2:50:06 PM] Joe: Hahah ok. Cause in English that exact saying usually comes before admitting to something bad.

Like “You’re going to kill me....I crashed your car”
[4/28/20, 2:51:06 PM] Lore: Jajaj también se usa así en español!  Negativo y positivo
[4/28/20, 2:52:52 PM] Joe: Hahah oooh ok. I never really here it used positively in English but I guess it could be.


What was for dinner?? 🍽
‎[4/28/20, 2:53:03 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[4/28/20, 2:54:24 PM] Lore: a crepe with ham and cheese and a beer.  hahaha simple
[4/28/20, 2:54:46 PM] Lore: Jajaa
[4/28/20, 2:55:04 PM] Lore: 🤷🤷🤷
[4/28/20, 2:58:00 PM] Lore: Que tal en la playa???
[4/28/20, 3:01:13 PM] Joe: Sounds like a tasty dinner hah

Beaches were nice but it was starting to get cloudy like it might rain. 

I’m back home now. I skated through town and back. Everything is so close it, it doesn’t take much time to see everything.
[4/28/20, 3:03:36 PM] Joe: Oh and thank you for showing me that bug in my game. I fixed it 👍 

I probably never would’ve noticed it haha
[4/28/20, 3:07:16 PM] Lore: It seems that you are alone in town! The end of the world !
[4/28/20, 3:08:13 PM] Lore: Mmm 🤔?
[4/28/20, 3:09:42 PM] Joe: Click click
[4/28/20, 3:09:46 PM] Joe: I fixed it
[4/28/20, 3:10:15 PM] Joe: When you tried my game you went back and the screen went black
[4/28/20, 3:10:25 PM] Lore: Ah hahha lo probaste con tus amigos al final?
[4/28/20, 3:11:11 PM] Joe: Yes! And my brother haha. Still more things to fix but we at least got to play a few rounds
‎[4/28/20, 3:11:36 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[4/28/20, 3:12:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha is that mr bean? Cause it looks like mr bean
[4/28/20, 3:13:34 PM] Lore: I always liked it, even when I was older.  I laugh a lot hahaha
[4/28/20, 3:14:27 PM] Joe: Yeah Mr. Bean is hella funny. I should watch some of his stuff today haha
[4/28/20, 3:15:02 PM] Joe: We’ll have to play each other in my game soon 👨‍💻👩‍💻
[4/28/20, 3:18:27 PM] Joe: Oh I don’t know if “hella” translates? It’s like “mucho” but you probably got that. 


I say hella, hella often haha
[4/28/20, 3:19:24 PM] Joe: What is some spanish slang you say a lot that probably won’t translate well??
[4/28/20, 3:20:48 PM] Lore: Hahah
[4/28/20, 3:21:11 PM] Lore: Muy o mucho
[4/28/20, 3:21:43 PM] Lore: Muy divertido
[4/28/20, 3:22:31 PM] Lore: Siiiii! Lo probamos mañana si querés! Dice dice yihaaa
[4/28/20, 3:23:56 PM] Lore: Yo digo mucho, boluda/boludo. Demasiado. Jaja. En Uruguay y Argentina es típico decir así a una persona. En negativo y en positivo

[4/28/20, 3:32:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok I understand that. I wouldn’t use it myself cause I’d be afraid to use it at the wrong time haha but I kind of get it
[4/28/20, 3:32:23 PM] Lore: Or affectionate, positive ...
[4/28/20, 3:33:23 PM] Joe: Alright, tomorrow, you and me haha

Beer is cool too though but much harder for me to code if I drink 🍹
[4/28/20, 3:43:06 PM] Lore: Jajajaja Joe!
[4/28/20, 3:43:15 PM] Lore: "La puta madre"
[4/28/20, 3:43:38 PM] Lore: Otra expresión que digo mucho jaja cómo omg pero mal

[4/28/20, 3:47:42 PM] Joe: Haha I’m good at gifs sometimes. 

It’ll probably last longer than a month. I’ll be back in California before I finish this. I’ll have to give some to my cousin and my sister haha. It was $160
[4/28/20, 3:48:38 PM] Lore: Okay okay, The couple if old hippies didn't give you..did you them right? 🤔😅
[4/28/20, 3:49:51 PM] Lore: Ah volvés al final a Cali? En junio, hay campamento de skate? Cuánto fumas por día? Toda la familia fuma jaja
[4/28/20, 3:50:01 PM] Joe: No nooo not the old couple haha. My sister has a friend to get it.
[4/28/20, 3:51:31 PM] Lore: I know, It was a joke..puta barrera de idioma 🥴
[4/28/20, 3:52:01 PM] Joe: Mmm it depends. Sometimes I don’t smoke. But in quarantine I’ve been smoking a lot more haha. Too much time to chill with the other smokers 😂
[4/28/20, 3:52:52 PM] Lore: Sos bueno con los gifs. Hay gente que me envía y son muy malos,jaja y tengo que reír obligada como.. ja! Ja!
[4/28/20, 3:54:08 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it sucks sometimes but I still have fun talking to you

At least gifs work for jokes haha. Gif....the universal language
[4/28/20, 3:54:59 PM] Lore: tell me.  haha how much for day. In California?  and how much in Hawaii?
[4/28/20, 3:56:50 PM] Lore: haha yes gif and smile universal language!
[4/28/20, 4:00:49 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I don’t take notes of it but I will smoke pretty often 😂 

I guess if one ounce last me one month the math works out to about 1 gram per day
[4/28/20, 4:02:55 PM] Joe: That’s out here in Hawaii. I guess in California it’s a lot less cause I work a lot when I’m out there
[4/28/20, 4:04:12 PM] Lore: Jaja aquí se calcula por número
[4/28/20, 4:04:24 PM] Lore: Ahí se mezcla con tabaco?
[4/28/20, 4:07:44 PM] Joe: No I don’t like mixing with tabaco really. 

Oh and I smoke from a bong often while I’m here so that’s why I can’t exactly say I smoke 1 joint or something if that’s what you mean.
[4/28/20, 4:09:10 PM] Joe: I can feel you judging me from halfway around the world 🙊🙉🙈

[4/28/20, 4:12:52 PM] Joe: Hahahaha 😂 shit
[4/28/20, 4:13:07 PM] Lore: Yo fumo menos, muy eventual, por momentos más, por ejemplo en verano o cuarentena jajaja. Ya lo sabes, yo soy más de cerveza. Para comer y para cenar 🤷 Don't judge me jaja 👨🏻‍⚖️
[4/28/20, 4:13:34 PM] Joe: Ok ok for sure. That’s true.
[4/28/20, 4:14:47 PM] Lore: No sé si hacemos buena pareja ..el fumado y la borracha 😂

I should’ve done that instead! I was working on another project and watching YouTube. Today I’m going to try to make my game a little less ugly
[4/29/20, 1:50:26 PM] Lore: Mini Joe 😂
[4/29/20, 1:51:33 PM] Lore: Hahaha how?
[4/29/20, 1:54:43 PM] Joe: I don’t even know yet 😂 

I’m sure it can look better somehow so I’m going to just experiment with it. Try random stuff and see what I like. If anything it’ll be good practice.
[4/29/20, 1:57:31 PM] Lore: Of course, haha, I'm curious about the things that can be done. Could you for example move the dice? or even a simulation, remember messenger, the buzz?
[4/29/20, 2:01:45 PM] Joe: Anything you think of could most likely be done. That’s why i really like programming. Figuring out how to do some things can be a pain in the ass though haha

[4/29/20, 2:28:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I’m testing it. There is a problem where it disconnects you after a while if you don’t do anything
[4/29/20, 2:29:37 PM] Joe: Oh and you can roll up to 5 times at the most. You have to pick up at least one die every time you roll but can pick up more if you want.

[4/29/20, 2:37:13 PM] Lore: Arghhhg
[4/29/20, 2:37:27 PM] Lore: Jajaja me haces trampa? 🤔
[4/29/20, 2:37:48 PM] Joe: Hahahah no no never
[4/29/20, 2:38:00 PM] Lore: Jajajaja okey ahora me hiciste ganar?
[4/29/20, 2:38:03 PM] Joe: Aaaahhh there you go! Hahaha

[4/29/20, 2:42:33 PM] Lore: Y esto?
[4/29/20, 2:42:35 PM] Lore: Me quedé sola
[4/29/20, 2:42:40 PM] Joe: See it’s broken 🤬

[4/29/20, 2:43:37 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 


Sorry that was my bad coding skills. Game still doesn’t work 100% but that was fun. Thanks for playing!!
[4/29/20, 2:56:41 PM] Lore: haha don't get frustrated, there are always mistakes before something good. I support you with it, whenever you want we will try playing again! 🤙🏼
[4/29/20, 2:58:11 PM] Joe: Thanks! We’ll play again soon when it’s less sketchy haha
‎[4/29/20, 2:59:45 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[4/29/20, 3:05:38 PM] Lore: Uoo big change!!!
[4/29/20, 3:23:02 PM] Joe: Yeah now for animation and sound. That will definitely take some time to figure out but I’m going to take a little break for now.

So when are you done with that course? I want to see what you can do when you’re done ✅
[4/29/20, 3:25:54 PM] Lore: poco a poco, creo que quedará muy bien el juego!
[4/29/20, 3:29:48 PM] Lore: Today the course is very bad, We started seeing the tutorials, we have taken notes to do it, the explanation wasn't clear and when We are going to start doing the exercise on the computer, the program had a failure and the teacher recommended me to install the 2020 version. therefore, all morning wasted 😒
[4/29/20, 3:33:05 PM] Lore: the course doesn´t have an exact end date...It is online and at your own pace. It depends how much it costs us to do the exercises, or if We have to repeat them again, all that takes time
[4/29/20, 3:34:41 PM] Joe: Damn...rough day. Tomorrow will be better 💪
[4/29/20, 3:36:49 PM] Joe: Oh Ok. Good luck getting through it all! Courses can be a little frustrating sometimes but especially the online ones when you’re having problems. 

At least you have your roommate doing the course with you.
[4/29/20, 3:48:00 PM] Lore: Yes, although I like the dynamics of the online course, I can always watch the videos again when I have doubts and the Skype teacher solves everything at once. The study center is in Barcelona.
[4/29/20, 3:50:52 PM] Lore: With her We went through different processes...anger, laughter, today finally 2 beers each and a whole bag of potatoes
[4/29/20, 3:52:53 PM] Lore: Que tal se plantea tu día???
[4/29/20, 3:54:15 PM] Joe: Hahaha sounds like an emotional morning 


I’m doing boring stuff today. Listening to earnings calls right now 😂

[5/1/20, 9:21:29 AM] Lore: Good memory, saying "vos", like a Uruguayan 👏✌️
[5/1/20, 9:27:05 AM] Joe: Haha I’m trying. 

Yesterday I spent way too much time on that dumb game but it looks waaaaaay better. So much better. My friend drew a background for the sign in and i added a chat too.
[5/1/20, 9:29:04 AM] Joe: I also added the sounds like you suggested but they only work on the computer. Still trying to get sounds working on tablets and phones. Hahah sorry I keep talking about my game 😂 😂
‎[5/1/20, 9:29:36 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/1/20, 9:40:51 AM] Lore: hahaha for nothing, for others maybe yes ... but I like that you continue with your game. What are you waiting to show me? I want to see those changes!!
[5/1/20, 9:44:33 AM] Lore: Joeeeee, me encanta el cambio!
‎[5/1/20, 9:46:04 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/1/20, 9:46:21 AM] Joe: Hahaha shit

[5/1/20, 9:47:09 AM] Lore: JAJAJAJAJA
[5/1/20, 9:48:07 AM] Lore: I get a lot of "3" lately ... haha yo´re the best!!
[5/1/20, 9:48:21 AM] Lore: *You´re
[5/1/20, 9:48:34 AM] Joe: Muchas gracias!
[5/1/20, 9:48:58 AM] Joe: It’s so much better now. It was really bad when I first showed it to you hahah. I should’ve waited 😂
[5/1/20, 9:49:11 AM] Lore: jajjaj Joe, eso lo acabas de hacer ahora?
[5/1/20, 9:49:53 AM] Lore: me estoy riendo sola jaja, los primeros tiros me salieron super altos, y el ultimo, te dí pena y me mandaste dos tiros con "3"? o fue casualidad? jajaa
[5/1/20, 9:50:01 AM] Joe: What the changes? I made them all yesterday.
‎[5/1/20, 9:53:44 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/1/20, 9:55:18 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I noticed that 😂
[5/1/20, 9:55:48 AM] Joe: Ok I’ll work on that. The ultimate feature will be built in translation so I can play with you hahaha
[5/1/20, 9:57:15 AM] Lore: con traductor? jajaja muy profesional!
[5/1/20, 9:57:32 AM] Joe: I have to fix the tie also. It says the first player wins on a tie every time
‎[5/1/20, 9:57:51 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/1/20, 9:58:10 AM] Lore: sii!
[5/1/20, 9:58:54 AM] Joe: Oh yeah. Um you just have to go to the website again. I haven’t figured out why that happens if you press reload
[5/1/20, 9:59:13 AM] Lore: In the end i couldn't bear to try it before giving you my opinion!!
[5/1/20, 10:00:04 AM] Joe: Hahaha I appreciate you taking the time to try it. You give good feedback that makes the game better
[5/1/20, 10:02:12 AM] Lore: El otro día, iba a decirte que podrías poner un estilo de ilustración como el video que me enviaste de Benal! me gustaba la tipografía y los colores, puede ser que sea el mismo chico que te hizo esto?? jaja que casualidad, me encanta!
[5/1/20, 10:03:46 AM] Lore: the sound seems to me a pluss.. it makes you want to play, it even sounds when I have the game window minimized!
[5/1/20, 10:05:36 AM] Lore: and the chat is great too, you can interact with the other player. You have to add gifts or faces like in whatsapp!
[5/1/20, 10:06:06 AM] Lore: como dirías vos: "siiiiiiiiiick"
[5/1/20, 10:06:10 AM] Joe: Haha it was the same guy! My friend Fav does all the illustrations and drew the animations in the Benal video by hand, frame by frame. He was in the video too. I love his style of illustrations
[5/1/20, 10:06:17 AM] Lore: jajaja
[5/1/20, 10:07:37 AM] Joe: Yeah I need emojis, gifs, and pictures for the chat. That’s a little more complicated but it can be done. That would definitely make it cooler.
[5/1/20, 10:10:16 AM] Joe: I like how excited you are about the changes to my game hahaha. It makes me want to keep working on it
[5/1/20, 10:13:37 AM] Lore: hahaha I'm glad, but it is a lot of evolution. I still love having tried the initial. if not, I couldn't have given you my opinion now

[5/1/20, 10:36:20 AM] Joe: You are addicted haha
[5/1/20, 10:37:25 AM] Lore: It is an option that a teacher once taught me to shorten links, haha ​​and I just remembered

[5/1/20, 11:03:24 AM] Lore: my tomorrow night? 😑🤔
[5/1/20, 11:04:48 AM] Lore: Enjoy that little walk on the skate and the pancakes with coffee!!! 😋

[5/2/20, 2:09:05 PM] Joe: Hola! Todavia vos despierto?
[5/2/20, 2:09:21 PM] Joe: Did you go outside today? How was it?
[5/2/20, 2:17:49 PM] Lore: Increíble!
[5/2/20, 2:18:04 PM] Lore: I'm happyyy
‎[5/2/20, 2:19:25 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/2/20, 2:39:35 PM] Joe: Haha nice! Glad you got to go out in the sun for a bit. Did you make that pizza from scratch? 

I made my own pizza from scratch last week and was all excited about it haha
‎[5/2/20, 2:40:35 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/2/20, 2:53:09 PM] Lore: haha before I bought all the pizza and put it in the oven directly.  Now frozen dough and fresh ingredients... Jaja poco a poco 🤷
[5/2/20, 3:02:25 PM] Joe: Lol I went from delivery to scratch, but only cause I didn’t have frozen dough. 


Making dough from scratch is only like 5 ingredients haha salt, yeast, oil, water, and flour. Have to wait 90 minutes for it to rise though so not great if you want it right away
[5/2/20, 3:03:34 PM] Joe: Anyway, enjoy your freedom 😆 

Next time you go out send some pics please. I would like to see a little bit of Madrid haha
[5/2/20, 3:13:10 PM] Lore: Ahí está la clave, 90 minutos para mí es mucho. Jajaja lo haré algún día, se nota la diferencia
[5/2/20, 3:14:46 PM] Lore: Haha okeyy, tomorrow I send you!
[5/2/20, 3:24:15 PM] Lore: Y vos, cómo estás??
[5/2/20, 3:27:51 PM] Joe: I’m doing great! I’m still working on my game. It went from a dumb thing for my friends, into something I might add to my portfolio if I can polish it up nicely. 

I added rooms so everyone doesn’t have to be in the same game and that took all yesterday to figure out haha. 

And my friend that did the illustrations wants me to make a portfolio website for him too so he can show off his art stuff. 


So I’ve been busy but that’s good 😂

[5/2/20, 3:36:55 PM] Joe: I’m going to change the link soon. Need to buy a domain name first haha
[5/2/20, 3:37:28 PM] Lore: Jaja cuál tenés pensado?
[5/2/20, 3:38:05 PM] Lore: Podrías poner uno en inglés/español haha😁
[5/2/20, 3:38:29 PM] Joe: Mmm I don’t know. I’ve been trying to come up with something. Waiting for the right name to come to me haha
[5/2/20, 3:39:36 PM] Joe: Haha I should. 

Let me know if you can think of any good names for the site 👍
‎[5/2/20, 3:40:55 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/2/20, 3:42:37 PM] Lore: Mmmm.. por ejemplo? Que pensaste
[5/2/20, 3:44:01 PM] Lore: ejem... ejem... vos tenés que pensar una room para nosotros
[5/2/20, 3:44:02 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/2/20, 3:44:10 PM] Joe: This is too true hahahahaha 

That is literally me when I have a coding problem. Only sitting around and thinking will solve it 🤣 🤣
[5/2/20, 3:44:55 PM] Joe: 😂 pick a name. I’ll make a room just for you haha
[5/2/20, 3:45:13 PM] Lore: It is one of my favorite gifs, haha ​​it looks like you hahahah

[5/2/20, 3:47:04 PM] Joe: Naming stuff is so hard! That’s why I made most of the rooms numbers. And one “benal” room of course
[5/2/20, 3:47:14 PM] Lore: JAJAJAJAJA
[5/2/20, 3:49:18 PM] Lore: Until you put one on, I don't play haha 🧟‍♀️
[5/2/20, 3:51:13 PM] Joe: Damn....I better go lay down in a field and do some thinking until I come up with a name haha

I’ll make one soon! I swear!

[5/3/20, 1:35:11 PM] Joe: So much police haha. That area looks interesting though. I bet there is tons of stuff to skate near by lol
[5/3/20, 2:42:43 PM] Lore: haha is that I saw several meetings and the thought was immediate. You have to teach me to see when it is good  haha
[5/3/20, 2:58:01 PM] Joe: Haha it’s probably hard to notice good spots if you don’t skate. I will try to teach you though.
[5/3/20, 2:58:46 PM] Joe: Give me a word in spanish to practice today. The app I downloaded gave me “el alfarero” haha. I need something better than that 😂
‎[5/3/20, 4:01:09 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 4:05:19 PM] Lore: Jajaja alfarero 😂 okey okey We have to practice

[5/3/20, 4:18:31 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/3/20, 4:19:42 PM] Lore: Que te apetece practicar?
[5/3/20, 4:22:29 PM] Joe: I’m going to the store right now hahaha no not right now. It’s already embarrassing when no one is around. 

But if you give me a word or phrase I’ll work on it and send you audio later. I just need something better and more useful than el alfarero 😝
[5/3/20, 4:28:06 PM] Lore: Mmm como? Lo primero no entendí
[5/3/20, 4:28:45 PM] Lore: Que vos vas a la tienda ahora y te da vergüenza si hay alguien cerca?
[5/3/20, 4:32:58 PM] Lore: Jaja alfarería es una profesión bonita, pero casi ya no se usa esa palabra. Se dice más cerámica ( pottery)
[5/3/20, 4:33:43 PM] Joe: Haha never mind. I thought you were going to ask me to send audio clips now for practice. 


But yeah send something useful for me.
[5/3/20, 4:34:00 PM] Joe: This is why I need to check with you before just learning these words haha
‎[5/3/20, 4:35:46 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted

[5/3/20, 5:04:13 PM] Lore: Ahora pinocho mejor, pero lo dijiste muy rápido y te falta la preposición de "a"
[5/3/20, 5:04:15 PM] Joe: Haha good. Please tell me when it’s terrible and how to improve.

‎[5/3/20, 5:17:11 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/3/20, 5:19:09 PM] Joe: Oh god this one is hard haha. I like the Uruguayan way of saying “yo”. Ok shit I’ll try but this will be the worst one yet haha
‎[5/3/20, 5:20:38 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/3/20, 5:20:38 PM] Lore: Jajaja thanks ☺️

[5/3/20, 5:22:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha dammit I tried
[5/3/20, 5:22:48 PM] Lore: Después  it sounded like an accent from southern Spain
‎[5/3/20, 5:23:06 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/3/20, 5:24:16 PM] Lore: Te salió todo bien, hay que repetir otra vez con "después" pronuncia más la "s"
[5/3/20, 5:25:13 PM] Joe: Lol damn really trying to have me get it right. Ok ok
[5/3/20, 5:26:00 PM] Lore: 💪💪💪
‎[5/3/20, 5:26:27 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/3/20, 5:26:35 PM] Joe: Hahah that was better I think
[5/3/20, 5:26:38 PM] Joe: 🤔
‎[5/3/20, 5:27:01 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/3/20, 5:27:07 PM] Joe: Wait that one haha
[5/3/20, 5:27:36 PM] Joe: Not the first one. I messed up “patino” in the first and didn’t record the whole thing
[5/3/20, 5:29:05 PM] Lore: Jajajaja 🏃
[5/3/20, 5:29:32 PM] Lore: Perfectooooo, la segunda vez!!!!!
[5/3/20, 5:30:16 PM] Lore: Si jaja
[5/3/20, 5:30:49 PM] Joe: I’m going to say tortitas all the time now haha I like tortitas
[5/3/20, 5:31:13 PM] Lore: One thing I am going to tell you, the Uruguayan accent works very well for you, better than the Spanish jajajj
[5/3/20, 5:31:47 PM] Lore: 😂🥞
[5/3/20, 5:34:00 PM] Joe: Nice! I never really paid attention to different accents in spanish cause it all sounded the same to me. Only thing I noticed is they talk faster in Spain haha

Now I need to go see what the Peruvian accent is supposed to be like 🤔

I’m trying to think of how my grandparents say “yo” but I’m not sure. I’ll have to call them and ask  them to speak to me in spanish
[5/3/20, 5:37:04 PM] Lore: Jajaj si hay muchos acentos.. Es muy gracioso cuando algún americano o inglés aprende español en un país como sudamérica, luego habla con su acento jaja como vos ahora
[5/3/20, 5:38:30 PM] Lore: Creo que en Perú se dice yo como en España,  la "y" solo se pronuncia como "sh" en Uruguay y Argentina
[5/3/20, 5:40:17 PM] Joe: Interesting 🤔 I didn’t know that.
[5/3/20, 5:40:18 PM] Lore: please, you have to speak to your grandparents spanish, haha ​​it would be very funny that they know that you are practicing!
[5/3/20, 5:41:11 PM] Joe: Dammit I’m going to have a stupid accent when I’m done learning 😂 It’ll be some weird mix of all the different accents haha
‎[5/3/20, 5:42:13 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 5:42:15 PM] Joe: Haha they’ll get too excited. I’m going to be back in California in about a month so I’ll surprise them with some spanish when I get back. They’ll love it
[5/3/20, 5:45:52 PM] Joe: Being consistent that’s all that matters to me. I don’t want to switch between accents in the middle of sentences. People will think I’m a weirdo haha


If someone went from a New York accent to Texas accent, to California accent in a few sentences it would be super weird. I assume it would be similar switching between accents in Spanish too haha
[5/3/20, 5:53:20 PM] Lore: Sería geniaaal, podríamos practicar cosas para que les digas a ellos jaja
[5/3/20, 5:53:36 PM] Lore: they would understand you anyway.  I can teach you mine 🤷 It is an accent that people like a lot in Spain, it would serve you very well to flirt with a girl haha
[5/3/20, 5:57:25 PM] Joe: Yeah we should do that haha otherwise I’ll just tell them how I want to smoke a joint
‎[5/3/20, 6:00:25 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:04:35 PM] Lore: Jajaja no eso no! 🤭
[5/3/20, 6:04:50 PM] Lore: 😒😒😒😒😒😒
[5/3/20, 6:05:56 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 I’d prefer an accent that works for you only but you’re the one that said it would work on all the girls hahahahaha!
‎[5/3/20, 6:09:03 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:09:47 PM] Lore: Jajaja era una trampa 😈
[5/3/20, 6:10:25 PM] Joe: Hahahaha!
‎[5/3/20, 6:11:18 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:11:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was really just joking I’m sorry 😂 

I don’t even like talking to people hahaha
[5/3/20, 6:13:27 PM] Joe: But also when you say that, I kind of take it as you wanting to be just friends or something so I don’t push the issue 🤷‍♂️
[5/3/20, 6:13:58 PM] Joe: Even though I do like you very much hahaha 🤗🤗
[5/3/20, 6:15:39 PM] Joe: If you knew me well, you would’ve thought the gif was funny because I’m faaaar from a “ladies man” hahaha. I’ve had like, 3 girlfriends, all pretty long term relationships

Anyways, hope you’re not actually bummed on that 😬
[5/3/20, 6:15:43 PM] Lore: Yo también bromeo todo el rato, jaja. No te gusta hablar con la gente? 🤨
[5/3/20, 6:16:52 PM] Joe: I’m definitely not someone that is in constant contact with my friends. I can go a pretty long time without talking to anyone haha
[5/3/20, 6:17:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja a un amigo no hablo tanto, y de hecho a chicos que me hablaron durante la cuarentena y que están cerca los ignoré, me parecía más divertido hablar con vos jaja
[5/3/20, 6:17:39 PM] Joe: And usually I avoid talking to strangers but if it’s a cool girl from across the world or an old hippie giving weed I’ll make an exception lol
[5/3/20, 6:19:34 PM] Joe: Haha I’m pretty much the same. The more distance the more fun to talk to maybe 😂
[5/3/20, 6:20:18 PM] Lore: Jajaja conseguí algunas palabras de cariño 🙅🤟👏. Yo siento lo mismo, aunque no puedo entender cómo con la distancia y sin conocerte en persona.. jaja
[5/3/20, 6:20:24 PM] Joe: It definitely helps when you make me do embarrassing things that you’re so far away
[5/3/20, 6:21:34 PM] Lore: Jaja se te nota, además como sos un poco tímido. Bueno,yo tuve varios novios pero mi relación larga fueron 10 años haha no entiendo como pasaron tantos tan rápido 🤭
[5/3/20, 6:23:11 PM] Lore: I love those exceptions!! 🎯
[5/3/20, 6:25:00 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got a little bit out of me 🤐
[5/3/20, 6:26:15 PM] Joe: 10 years is super long. My longest was 8.


Time is weird. It goes faster and faster as you get older too.
[5/3/20, 6:26:23 PM] Lore: Jaja algo más que me quieras decir? Tengo que aprovechar este momento jajaja
[5/3/20, 6:27:20 PM] Lore: Bastante tiempo también!
[5/3/20, 6:27:21 PM] Joe: Haha nooooo you got enough from me for one day 😂 

I’m over here telling you all kinds of shit you didn’t even ask about.
‎[5/3/20, 6:27:54 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:29:11 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[5/3/20, 6:29:19 PM] Lore: Bueno, ahora te lo estoy preguntando
[5/3/20, 6:30:25 PM] Joe: Maybe if you ask something specific I can tell you
[5/3/20, 6:31:34 PM] Joe: No seré un pinocho
[5/3/20, 6:31:44 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[5/3/20, 6:31:50 PM] Lore: Bien aplicado!
‎[5/3/20, 6:33:05 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:33:41 PM] Lore: I don't know what to ask you really, haha ​​what I don't know is if you are so naive as to think that I see you only as a friend haha
‎[5/3/20, 6:35:11 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:36:00 PM] Joe: Hahahaha!
[5/3/20, 6:36:03 PM] Joe: Wow

‎[5/3/20, 6:36:59 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:37:21 PM] Joe: I have no idea what’s going on sometimes hahaha I just go with the flow 😂
[5/3/20, 6:38:36 PM] Joe: I could be in Spain, at your place, and still be questioning whether you see me as just a friend or not hahahaha
‎[5/3/20, 6:39:54 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:41:09 PM] Lore: Jajajaja really?
‎[5/3/20, 6:41:34 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/3/20, 6:41:39 PM] Joe: That doesn’t mean I’m not interested though. I just never notice when a girl is into me like that
[5/3/20, 6:41:50 PM] Joe: Hahahah pretty much
[5/3/20, 6:44:17 PM] Joe: Dude it’s so late!! Go to sleep hahaha don’t you have class in 6 hours? Don’t fall asleep in class again 😂 


You’ve gotten enough out of me for now. You can continue shaming me tomorrow hahah
[5/3/20, 6:44:18 PM] Lore: haha yes.. I realized!!
[5/3/20, 6:45:42 PM] Lore: Jaja es que dormí siesta y no tenía sueño. Pero me quedé un rato más, se puso interesante la conversación, empezó con pinocho.. 😂
[5/3/20, 6:48:26 PM] Joe: Lol the most random thing to start a good conversation.

Well if you want to ask more questions feel free!
[5/3/20, 6:48:46 PM] Lore: Buenas noches, súper amigo a la distancia! Un beso 😘
[5/3/20, 6:48:54 PM] Lore: Jajaj mañana te hago más
[5/3/20, 6:49:09 PM] Lore: Aunque estoy esperando para jugar a los dados
[5/3/20, 6:50:26 PM] Joe: Haha we’ll play tomorrow! We can make a room with any name now 👍 

Buenas noches, Lore! Un beso 😘
[5/4/20, 12:30:42 PM] Joe: Hola!

[5/4/20, 12:33:18 PM] Joe: So much crazy shit happened hahaha I’m addicted to that show now. Can’t believe Moscow died. So sad 😞

Haha yeah, they do look like zombies 🧟‍♂️
[5/4/20, 1:26:12 PM] Joe: The actor that plays Denver is pretty good. Very convincing 😂 

That last episode was so epic. After I do some work I’m going to keep watching today.
[5/4/20, 1:28:35 PM] Lore: Ya te enseñaré poco a poco algo más de Madrid de día cuando me dejen moverme un poco más lejos que 1km jajaja
[5/4/20, 1:30:04 PM] Lore: Jaja sí es muy peculiar. Que más pasó?? Jaja te pregunto porque no quiero hacerte spoiler sin querer ya sabes jaja
[5/4/20, 1:31:26 PM] Joe: Haha poco a poco is good. Please don’t get arrested trying to show me Madrid 😂
[5/4/20, 1:32:00 PM] Joe: The last thing that happened was the inspector meeting up with the professor
[5/4/20, 1:32:11 PM] Joe: On the far away island 🌴
[5/4/20, 1:33:45 PM] Lore: Jajajaja yo tengo imán para las multas .. y cuando me multa la policía me enojo jaja 🙃
[5/4/20, 1:34:53 PM] Lore: Poco a poco, puede estar en la lista de toma la cuchara y traeme la escoba Jajaja
[5/4/20, 1:36:38 PM] Lore: Ah jajaja esa escena final es demasiado "cursi"
[5/4/20, 1:37:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha I know so many useful phrases! Basically mastered spanish at this point 😂

[5/4/20, 1:39:16 PM] Lore: Última escena de profesor con inspectora
[5/4/20, 1:39:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah a little bit. he definitely wouldn’t have sat there waiting for her phone to die before saying hello when she flew all the way to some random island
[5/4/20, 1:40:42 PM] Lore: Jajaj totalmente! Yo a ella no la soporto. No me gusta jaja su papel es una mierda no sabe actuar no me lo creo
[5/4/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I agree with you there. I don’t see how the show can go on now though haha! 

Seems like that was a fine place to end it. But, 2 parts to go so I guess there is a lot more to go.
[5/4/20, 1:43:53 PM] Lore: Jajaa uhhh queda mucho!
[5/4/20, 1:44:05 PM] Lore: Ay que bien, sabes que?
[5/4/20, 1:44:59 PM] Lore: Me había olvidado. Esto te va a venir bien para reforzar la lección de acentos en español jajaja. Entra un nuevo personaje! Es argentino! ( Tiene mi acento)
[5/4/20, 1:46:59 PM] Joe: Hahah cool! We’ll see if I can even notice it 😂
‎[5/4/20, 1:51:15 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 1:51:45 PM] Joe: But I put it on a domain I already own but never used haha “honecode.com” 

honecode.com
[5/4/20, 1:53:37 PM] Joe: Much easier to remember than the old one. But if you have any recommendations for a better name of the website I’d love to hear it haha. I can’t think of anything good 🤔
[5/4/20, 1:56:15 PM] Lore: Jaja nombre para el juego decís?
[5/4/20, 1:56:33 PM] Joe: Si
[5/4/20, 1:56:47 PM] Lore: Por qué te dicen Hone?
[5/4/20, 1:57:52 PM] Joe: Hahaha my friends just started calling me that a looooong time ago
[5/4/20, 1:59:20 PM] Joe: I got the name in high school. I guess it stuck with me ever since. Kind of fits though. I’m always trying to hone some new skill 😂 😂
[5/4/20, 1:59:44 PM] Lore: Pero porque? Jaja es como honey, de cariño? 🙄
[5/4/20, 2:02:19 PM] Joe: Haha no it’s not like that 😂 

I don’t know why. The best explanation I got from my friend that originally came up with it was because he was on mushrooms hahaha
[5/4/20, 2:03:19 PM] Lore: Jajaja pero es inventado el nombre entonces?
[5/4/20, 2:03:47 PM] Lore: Por un momento pensé que tus amigos te decían cariño o miel.. es raro 🤭
[5/4/20, 2:04:48 PM] Joe: Haha nooo. It’s hone. Like “afilar”.

[5/4/20, 2:07:57 PM] Joe: 😂 yeaaah I guess that would be a little weird hahaha

I don’t know. It’s a weird nickname but I didn’t pick it 🤷‍♂️
[5/4/20, 2:09:52 PM] Joe: You should tell me something embarrassing haha. I feel like I told you way too much yesterday and now you’re talking shit about my nickname hahaha
[5/4/20, 2:14:16 PM] Lore: Jajaja nooo!
[5/4/20, 2:14:30 PM] Lore: Suena bien, pero quería saber el motivo del apodo!!
[5/4/20, 2:15:11 PM] Lore: Cool shiiiiiit, como dirías vos jaja

[5/4/20, 3:11:39 PM] Joe: Haha it’s so hard! I’m trying to understand what’s wrong with my D but it sounds different all the time. Not very consistent.
[5/4/20, 3:12:18 PM] Lore: JAJAJAJA
[5/4/20, 3:12:27 PM] Lore: quiero escuchar, esas "d" diferentes
[5/4/20, 3:13:03 PM] Joe: Noooo haha. I need more English from you if you’re going to get more spanish out of me 😝
[5/4/20, 3:14:24 PM] Lore: okey okey, es lo justo. jaja yo tengo un deber de hace dias que no hice. jaja decimelo otra vez, y te lo repito
[5/4/20, 3:15:46 PM] Lore: "I'm ashamed, but I don't care, because Joe teaches me" same message I sent you but in English 👂
[5/4/20, 3:16:12 PM] Joe: Haha alright!
‎[5/4/20, 3:16:36 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted

[5/4/20, 3:21:19 PM] Joe: Wow that was really good! I like how you say my name with your accent hahaha
[5/4/20, 3:23:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja 🤡
[5/4/20, 3:25:02 PM] Joe: 😂 I like it. You should send more! Now i understand why you like it when I send you audio of me speaking Spanish.
[5/4/20, 3:28:54 PM] Lore: hahaha if it's fun, We have to send more, although We are ashamed...surely We can learn something and laugh at it
[5/4/20, 3:30:39 PM] Lore: te diste cuenta que cada uno pronuncia la "d" diferente? ejemplo.. a vos te cuesta pronunciar la "d" en apodo y en dados, y yo la pronuncio más fuerte "I don´t care"
[5/4/20, 3:32:06 PM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJ36egtZ4M
[5/4/20, 3:32:40 PM] Joe: Yeah I still don’t hear it haha. So I’m not putting enough emphasis on the “d”. It sounds like I’m missing the letter or something?
[5/4/20, 3:32:42 PM] Lore: Me gusta este tema, hace tiempo no lo escuchaba
[5/4/20, 3:34:36 PM] Lore: mmm a vos te falta pronunciar la d más fuerte, y a mi más suave creo...Ejemplo :apodo, dado(vos), y yo (I don´t care)
[5/4/20, 3:34:38 PM] Joe: The second sentence was supposed to be a question lol

I’m not pronouncing “d” strong enough or what?
[5/4/20, 3:36:05 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll try to pronounce the “d” more loudly. I thought it sounded fine when you said “I don’t care” though
‎[5/4/20, 3:37:58 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/4/20, 3:42:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m having a hard time with my Ds 😂
[5/4/20, 3:43:38 PM] Joe: I’m listening to your audio, trying to internalize that pronunciation haha

[5/4/20, 3:46:26 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja me estoy riendo mucho con el primer audio
[5/4/20, 3:46:35 PM] Lore: No puedo parar de escucharlo
[5/4/20, 3:46:54 PM] Lore: No no no no no
[5/4/20, 3:47:04 PM] Lore: Jajajaj ayyyy

[5/4/20, 3:48:49 PM] Lore: Nomino no! Quería decir " no no no no"
[5/4/20, 3:49:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was struggling to get it right
‎[5/4/20, 3:50:33 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/4/20, 3:51:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha stop it! Hahahahaha
[5/4/20, 3:52:24 PM] Joe: Glad I could make you laugh but damn....shame on me Hahahaha
[5/4/20, 3:53:34 PM] Lore: jajaja perdón, no me rio de vos! me rio del audio, me hizo mucha graciaaa... nonoono aaaapodo, apodo.. fuck jajaja
[5/4/20, 3:53:46 PM] Joe: I don’t embarrass myself often, but with you it feels like everyday 😂 😂 😂 

You’re good at getting me to do stuff haha
[5/4/20, 3:53:49 PM] Lore: okey, pero el segundo audio, fue muy bueno. apodo te salio perfecto!
[5/4/20, 3:54:37 PM] Lore: oh noooo, sorry!!!
[5/4/20, 3:55:32 PM] Joe: Haha it’s ok. I give you permission to laugh at me and the audio. It’s all in good fun. 


And I don’t mind embarrassing myself for you 🤷‍♂️
[5/4/20, 3:59:58 PM] Joe: Make fun of me while you can. Cause I’m going to learn how to speak Spanish so good. And with any accent haha.
[5/4/20, 4:00:50 PM] Lore: jaja pobrecito! pero no quiero avergonzarte negativamente, me pareces un chico geniaaal, jaja l me gustan vinculos espontaneos y naturales!
[5/4/20, 4:01:26 PM] Lore: uoooooooo!!jaja
‎[5/4/20, 4:02:35 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 4:03:14 PM] Joe: Don’t worry, you messing with me like that probably makes me like you more anyway haha
[5/4/20, 4:03:19 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/4/20, 4:06:08 PM] Lore: jajaja seguro, no creo que lo estes pasando demasiado mal hablando conmigo aunque te haga pasar un poquito de verguenza!
[5/4/20, 4:11:00 PM] Joe: I’m just a shy guy on that you found on the internet. 

I’ve never really had someone “slide in my DMs” like that hahaha so random
‎[5/4/20, 4:12:14 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 4:12:46 PM] Joe: Hahah no it’s not even embarrassing 😂
[5/4/20, 4:12:58 PM] Joe: I just want to know, like, why me? Hahaha
[5/4/20, 4:13:44 PM] Lore: JAJAJA
[5/4/20, 4:17:09 PM] Lore: no lo sé, es raro... la cuestión fue que me llegó una opción en tinder de poner ubicación en otro país, y fueron los primeros dias de cuarentena y me dio por mirar en Australia, y Hawaii, jaja... en Madrid los chicos de tinder, no me gustan nada.. jaja tienen estilo de oficina, clasicos, o muy arreglados, depilados, con ropa ajustada, muchas fotos posando.. puaj... jaja
[5/4/20, 4:18:34 PM] Lore: y en Hawaii,  de repente te ví a vos, miré tu instagram y creo que te dí a seguir, y a las horas me empezaste a seguir vos
[5/4/20, 4:20:52 PM] Lore: asi que es un poco dificil, decir por que a vos, al principio solo vi algunas fotos y me pareciste interesante.. intenté hablarte pero me respondiste muy seco.. pero después volvimos a hablar, y ahi noté un buena conexión, asi que por todo eso, te elijo a vos jaja
[5/4/20, 4:20:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah you like that I’m more of a “dirtbag” than the guys in Madrid 😂
[5/4/20, 4:21:56 PM] Lore: jajaja nooo!
[5/4/20, 4:22:16 PM] Joe: Hahahaha ooook sure
[5/4/20, 4:23:13 PM] Lore: no todos los chicos de Madrid son así.. pero  no me atrae demasiado su estilo de vida o conversación
[5/4/20, 4:23:51 PM] Lore: no sé.. jajaja ahi tenés toda la explicación, te sirve?
[5/4/20, 4:24:03 PM] Joe: I definitely thought it was interesting when you messaged me but like I said, that hasn’t happened before so I really didn’t know how to respond other than to answer your question 😂 

Clueless
‎[5/4/20, 4:26:09 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 4:26:15 PM] Lore: haha if it is logical, I don't write to boys like that normally, haha ​​I only did it once in Costa Rica, with a boy I met surfing and with nobody else..haha
[5/4/20, 4:28:25 PM] Joe: Hah yeah I don’t write to anyone. Ever 😂
[5/4/20, 4:28:51 PM] Joe: I don’t know how you got me to talk to you so much. You pulled me in slowly
‎[5/4/20, 4:29:56 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 4:31:43 PM] Lore: Es verdad!!! jaja no tengo la necesidad de tener contactos con chicos tan lejos....!!
[5/4/20, 4:33:04 PM] Lore: Yo no sé tampoco como pasó, jaja parecía que era imposible que hablemos... vos inglés, yo español. Vos Hawaii, yo España. horario completamente diferente..y vos sin whatsapp!!! jajaa no entiendo como pasó!
[5/4/20, 4:33:16 PM] Joe: Haha I believe you don’t worry. I was just saying, I never reach out to people.
[5/4/20, 4:34:05 PM] Joe: There were definitely many more convenient choices than me haha
[5/4/20, 4:35:03 PM] Joe: The more difficult the better for you 😂
[5/4/20, 4:35:44 PM] Lore: vos sos la mejor opción
[5/4/20, 4:36:08 PM] Lore: 🤐
‎[5/4/20, 4:37:49 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/4/20, 4:39:26 PM] Joe: But seriously though, 12 hour time difference and a language barrier!? And I’m still the best option? Hahaha nice
[5/4/20, 4:40:48 PM] Lore: haha mmm in the end you're going to make me change my mind!
[5/4/20, 4:40:54 PM] Joe: I’m not complaining though. Thank you very much 😂 

I didn’t choose you, but I would if I could.
[5/4/20, 4:41:16 PM] Joe: Lo siento 😆
[5/4/20, 4:42:30 PM] Joe: Ok ok enough of that. Thanks for explaining why me. I just had to ask.
[5/4/20, 4:44:37 PM] Lore: jaja de nada! 👌🏻
[5/4/20, 4:51:42 PM] Lore: Gracias!!🤗
[5/4/20, 4:55:44 PM] Joe: https://www.honecode.com

Want to play? 😂
[5/4/20, 4:56:30 PM] Lore: Joeee I'm going to sleep, tomorrow again with the course, I feel like it!Que tengas un buen día y puedas avanzar con tu juego!
[5/4/20, 4:56:44 PM] Lore: haha okey, un ratito para probar
[5/4/20, 4:57:00 PM] Lore: room?
[5/4/20, 4:57:18 PM] Joe: oso
[5/4/20, 4:57:20 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/4/20, 4:57:32 PM] Lore: jajaja good name

[5/4/20, 5:05:04 PM] Joe: Aw what??
[5/4/20, 5:05:16 PM] Joe: Damn my game is messing up cause I still see you
[5/4/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: Ah now I’m back. Fuck. More bugs to fix hahaha
[5/4/20, 5:06:19 PM] Lore: jaja yo sigo dentro, es tu turno!
[5/4/20, 5:06:55 PM] Joe: It said game over so I had to reset
‎[5/5/20, 12:11:53 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/5/20, 12:35:58 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/5/20, 12:36:02 PM] Lore: Voy a probarlo!!!

[5/5/20, 12:36:55 PM] Lore: ahora, ya!
[5/5/20, 12:37:40 PM] Joe: Hahaha!
‎[5/5/20, 1:04:06 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/5/20, 1:04:18 PM] Joe: I think we got disconnected haha. I still have more to fix
[5/5/20, 1:05:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha more design tips from the master. You should work on being a web designer AND interior designer haha. 

With the web design you can work from anywhere like me 😂
[5/5/20, 1:06:56 PM] Lore: jajaja la paciencia no es uno de mis mejores fuertes, ya lo sabes! jaja
[5/5/20, 1:07:32 PM] Lore: aunque me gusta lo de diseño web, también me gusta el diseño editorial, al final esta todo bastante relacionado
[5/5/20, 1:07:36 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[5/5/20, 1:09:08 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s all about having that eye for good design.
[5/5/20, 1:09:23 PM] Joe: Which I don’t have. As you can tell by my website and color choices hahaha
‎[5/5/20, 1:10:07 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/5/20, 1:10:26 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/5/20, 1:10:38 PM] Lore: mmmm
[5/5/20, 1:10:54 PM] Joe: I don’t like the green I chose but I’m so bad at picking colors
[5/5/20, 1:10:57 PM] Lore: que tipografía es? a lo mejor puedes buscar otra!
[5/5/20, 1:10:58 PM] Joe: I just gave up
[5/5/20, 1:11:02 PM] Lore: y colores, blanco con negro?
‎[5/5/20, 1:11:32 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/5/20, 1:11:35 PM] Joe: Yes I probably should. Pretty sure I’m using Roboto
[5/5/20, 1:11:45 PM] Lore: negro con negro
[5/5/20, 1:11:58 PM] Lore: amarillo o el naranja con negro
‎[5/5/20, 1:12:30 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/5/20, 1:12:57 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll try those colors instead of mushed pea green hahaha I pick gross colors 😂
[5/5/20, 1:13:27 PM] Lore: esos 3 colores estan bien
[5/5/20, 1:13:38 PM] Lore: los unicos que no "pegan" son los azules no?
[5/5/20, 1:15:24 PM] Joe: Aren’t they all the same? Haha. Or do you mean to match the buttons in the game? Like roll dice button.
[5/5/20, 1:16:20 PM] Joe: 🤔 I’m not sure what you mean. You notice a lot of small details ahah. I think you would be good at this
[5/5/20, 1:26:03 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/5/20, 1:26:18 PM] Lore: me refiero a los rectangulos, que uno sobresale y podrían estar en horizontal
[5/5/20, 1:26:40 PM] Lore: y el color del relleno de los rectángulos, azul no combina con el resto
[5/5/20, 1:32:32 PM] Lore: I tried one thing, quickly with photoshop. But I'm not a graphic designer or anything, but maybe something like that could be better for you? haha I don't know huh, just my opinion, don't pay much attention either!
[5/5/20, 1:32:47 PM] Joe: Shit. More color picking haha.

[5/5/20, 1:33:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn you’re good
[5/5/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: That was quick 😂
[5/5/20, 1:35:24 PM] Joe: Learn to use Adobe XD and I bet you’ll be able to land freelance jobs doing graphic/web design. Cause people like me have no idea what we’re doing and need help hahah
[5/5/20, 1:39:49 PM] Lore: jaja nah, yo no tengo idea, me desesperaría con los códigos! jajaa aunque tengo que reconocer que me gusta el diseño grafico, intento aplicarlo en las presentaciones de mis diseños, pero no sé, lo de tu juego es solo una opinión, me dieron ganas de probarlo! jajaja
[5/5/20, 1:44:37 PM] Joe: Adobe XD is mostly drag and drop. More similar to using photoshop than coding. You would be good at it. 

Then you hand the design off to someone like me to build it. 


When you’re ready to design a site for your interior design stuff, try out Adobe XD and I’ll build what you come up with haha
‎[5/5/20, 1:46:23 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/5/20, 1:46:47 PM] Lore: o sabía tampoco la diferencia, pensé que un desarrollador web, hacia todo.. el diseño y el trabajo de los "codigos" jajaja
[5/5/20, 1:48:12 PM] Lore: *No
[5/5/20, 1:49:10 PM] Lore: thanks for the words, if one day I discover my new profession I will call you hahaha
[5/5/20, 1:51:24 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it’s a pretty cool program for making small designs. I should really practice using it and work on my design skill 😂 

I guess I would be considered developer, not a designer. The people that are really good at both are rare but I’d like to get there one day
[5/5/20, 1:55:23 PM] Lore: siiii, deberías empezar a usarlo, y así ya tienes algo más en tu portfolio! yo creo que para tener ojo, hay que ver cosas, inspirarte, al final así podés diferenciar lo que te gusta y lo que no te gusta, y ser más crítico
[5/5/20, 2:02:36 PM] Joe: You should’ve seen some of my first website hahaha. Oh god. They looked like they were designed by a 5 year old with a crayon 😂
[5/5/20, 2:03:34 PM] Joe: Design is weird to me cause of the subjectivity. The code either works, or it doesn’t. But the design is much harder to tell if it’s good in my opinion
[5/5/20, 2:04:18 PM] Joe: Well...I can tell when something is ugly, and I can tell when it looks good. But coming up with the good looking design in my mind is so difficult!
[5/5/20, 2:18:27 PM] Lore: (voy a cenar, te escribo  cuando acabe y vaya a mí habitación oso)
‎[5/5/20, 2:21:21 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/5/20, 2:22:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok, enjoy!
[5/5/20, 3:38:14 PM] Lore: Ya estoy!
[5/5/20, 3:39:22 PM] Lore: Jajajaja cuando empezaste? Mi primer plano fue horrible también! 😂
[5/5/20, 3:42:18 PM] Lore: Jaja sí tenés razón, es muy subjetivo. De hecho hay gente que se dedica al diseño y no comparto para nada su estilo.Pero ahí están, y se ganan la vida con ello.  Los códigos funcionan o no funcionan, me parece muy difícil! Pero supongo que entretenido cuando ya sabes hacerlo!
[5/5/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Yeah when I first started making websites. They were all so ugly. Good thing I didn’t save those haha
[5/5/20, 3:44:02 PM] Joe: The best part is you never fully know how to code so there is always a bunch you can learn. Makes it so it doesn’t get boring
[5/5/20, 3:44:10 PM] Lore: Jaja buena explicación! Feo o bueno. Debes inspirarte entonces para luego hacer cosas como las que te parecen buenas o te gustan
[5/5/20, 3:45:24 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I dont visit enough websites but I started going to random ones for bigger companies to get an idea of how the pros do it
[5/5/20, 3:45:55 PM] Joe: I’m really far off from their style hahaha but if I get a design I can make it so it doesn’t matter too much I guess.
[5/5/20, 3:46:20 PM] Lore: hahaha  but how many years ago?  I found a folder with my first works, they are like an intimate diary when you are little, that you would be ashamed to see someone.
[5/5/20, 3:48:13 PM] Lore: You will have to try!  Save yourself reference images, fonts that you like, color combination, shape distribution, etc...
[5/5/20, 3:48:26 PM] Joe: Look at 3:00, have you ever heard of that haha?

https://youtu.be/ij3qiyyXbJY
[5/5/20, 3:50:09 PM] Joe: About 2 years ago is when I first started making websites but I was doing other kind of coding before that for a year or two.
[5/5/20, 3:51:38 PM] Joe: Yeah I need to get better at typography and color combinations the most but also general layout. 
There are also people that are experts in “UX” design which is “user experience” haha
[5/5/20, 3:52:15 PM] Joe: I need to improve in my UX skills also haha it’s never ending
[5/5/20, 3:53:01 PM] Lore: Jaja no conozco ninguna expresión de Perú la verdad, me parecen super raras jajaja. Conozco el acento, conocí a alguna persona de Perú pero poco rato
[5/5/20, 3:54:02 PM] Lore: Los uruguayos no tenemos mismo acento que peruanos, ni expresiones. Uruguay y Argentina son muy iguales. A mí en España me confunden continuamente con Argentina, pero no con peruana
[5/5/20, 3:54:09 PM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll learn the Peruvian phrases and teach you 😂
‎[5/5/20, 3:55:31 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/5/20, 3:55:36 PM] Lore: Solo digo para que puedas imaginarte cosas en tu cabeza, debes inspirarte un poco, y esos detalles te pueden ayudar!
[5/5/20, 3:56:26 PM] Lore: Jajajaja yo también quiero eso! Nunca acaba esto.. Joe ahora vos me estás sumando más cosas que tengo que aprender jajajaja
[5/5/20, 3:56:29 PM] Joe: Definitely! I really appreciate it! I take criticism of my work pretty well. I just want to get better at doing things haha
[5/5/20, 3:56:39 PM] Lore: 😂
[5/5/20, 3:57:17 PM] Lore: Siiiiiii! Buen oído!!!!!!! 👏👏
[5/5/20, 3:57:52 PM] Lore: Él está imitando el acento nuestro, jaja es muy malo jajaja
[5/5/20, 3:58:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was wondering if it was really bad or not. You can hear Denver talking shit about the accent after he says it hahaha
[5/5/20, 4:00:20 PM] Lore: they are constructive criticism.  I love that they tell me!  then I decide if it works for me or not, hahaha but many times you focus on things that someone else may see from the outside and you had not realized
[5/5/20, 4:01:14 PM] Lore: I like your work, your dice game, that's why I give you some opinion  haha
[5/5/20, 4:02:26 PM] Lore: Jaja sí Denver dice " el peor acento que he escuchado en mi vida tronco"
[5/5/20, 4:03:02 PM] Lore: Tronco en españa es como boludo .. especialmente en Madrid se dice tronco ( chico) tronca ( chica)
[5/5/20, 4:03:19 PM] Lore: Que paaaaasa tronco?
[5/5/20, 4:04:21 PM] Joe: Thank you 🙏🏽 you got to see the game evolve over time haha it’s getting better slowly.
[5/5/20, 4:04:37 PM] Lore: Sería como "What's up dude "
[5/5/20, 4:04:40 PM] Joe: You had some good input that made it noticeably better
[5/5/20, 4:05:17 PM] Lore: Tengo las imágenes originales jaja, las guardaré para el final
[5/5/20, 4:05:27 PM] Joe: Now you’re speaking my language. Que pasa tronca??? Hahaha
[5/5/20, 4:05:41 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/5/20, 4:05:43 PM] Joe: Que pasa boluda?? Hahaha
[5/5/20, 4:06:09 PM] Lore: Si usas el boluda mejor de qué pasa.. sería...
[5/5/20, 4:06:19 PM] Lore: Cómo andás boluda????
‎[5/5/20, 4:06:43 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/5/20, 4:08:32 PM] Joe: Alright well your Peruvian slang word for the day is “chela”

I wonder if you can guess what it means 🤔 hahaha

[5/5/20, 4:19:37 PM] Lore: Fuck jaja qué significa? Palta es aguacate, avocado
[5/5/20, 4:19:57 PM] Lore: Que significa la expresión que palta? 🙄
[5/5/20, 4:20:03 PM] Joe: I know. You should watch that first video at 3:00 hahah
[5/5/20, 4:21:27 PM] Lore: Jaja okey que verguenza!

[5/5/20, 4:30:53 PM] Lore: Jajaja una pregunta sabes cómo funciona lo de la marihuana en California?
[5/5/20, 4:33:17 PM] Lore: the job of cutting Maria into farms?
[5/5/20, 4:34:40 PM] Joe: Mmmm I mean...I used to work at a marijuana distribution center in California so I know a little bit of how it works haha
[5/5/20, 4:35:26 PM] Joe: I don’t know what you mean by this
[5/5/20, 4:35:30 PM] Lore: Contame!!! Jaja
[5/5/20, 4:35:50 PM] Lore: Jajaj no???
[5/5/20, 4:36:01 PM] Lore: 🤨🤔🤨🤔🧐🤔
[5/5/20, 4:37:23 PM] Joe: Well....it’s all legal, just a lot of regulations. But a licensed farmer takes the crop and gets it tested by the state for purity and quality. They also give the THC/ CBD content as a % of weight.
[5/5/20, 4:39:21 PM] Joe: Then the farmer can sell it to a distribution center like the place I worked at. We were small and only would buy maybe 10-20 pounds at a time but big places buy way more. 

We take the weed and package it in 1/8ths or 1gram packages or we would make joints with this machine that could make 100 joints at a time haha
[5/5/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Then we take our packed product and sell them to retail marijuana stores that can sell to anyone 21+
[5/5/20, 4:40:59 PM] Joe: Basically like any other business but a lot of paperwork and regulations. It was an interesting job. It was only me and one of my friends working the whole distribution so it was really fun hahaha
‎[5/5/20, 4:42:39 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/5/20, 4:43:19 PM] Lore: hahaha interesting, good job!  you know it well haha
[5/5/20, 4:44:06 PM] Joe: I was really good at that job and like it a lot but they treated my friend like shit, then when they fired him I just walked out haha
[5/5/20, 4:45:02 PM] Lore: I was referring to working on a farm.  I met many people in Costa Rica and even in Spain who were going to make a season to California. They say you make a lot of money!
[5/5/20, 4:45:27 PM] Lore: although the work is very hard
[5/5/20, 4:45:39 PM] Joe: Oooh ok. Yeah I’ve done trimming one season and I didn’t like it hahah. That was more farm work
[5/5/20, 4:46:01 PM] Joe: My cousin grows so I tried it with him one year. I like the distribution side haha
[5/5/20, 4:46:29 PM] Lore: Ohhh hijos de puta. Bueno por lo menos aprendiste jjjj
[5/5/20, 4:46:56 PM] Joe: Usually seasonal work on a farm involves trimming the plant. Usually paid per pound so it’s good money if you’re fast and know how to trim good but when you’re learning it’s not that great haha
[5/5/20, 4:47:45 PM] Lore: Jajaj posh boy
[5/5/20, 4:48:26 PM] Joe: Haha it was their loss not mine. They thought I’d stay when they fired him. Like I said, we ran the whole thing haha. 

Plus i had another job at the time. I only took the distribution gig cause my friend worked there
[5/5/20, 4:49:09 PM] Joe: Hahaha distribution is hard too!! It had way more variety of stuff to do though and I just found it more fun.
[5/5/20, 4:49:35 PM] Joe: The real posh boys are the ones in the retail part hahah
[5/5/20, 4:50:02 PM] Lore: Si decía ohh por el. Vos buen amigo por irte también! ☺️
[5/5/20, 4:50:22 PM] Joe: They don’t do shit but give the person what they order and they get tips and all kinds of shit.  You’d probably make hella good money working at a cannabis club hahaha
[5/5/20, 4:52:17 PM] Lore: Jijijij 🤭
[5/5/20, 4:55:24 PM] Lore: Como se dice en inglés una persona joven... Que se viste con ropa de marca, habla como raro .. que tiene dinero y suele ser de sus padres?
[5/5/20, 4:55:42 PM] Lore: Posh para chico y chica? O eso sería elegante?
[5/5/20, 4:55:59 PM] Lore: En España es pijo/pija y en Uruguay cheto/cheta
‎[5/5/20, 4:56:35 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/5/20, 4:59:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha yeah I think “posh” is good for boy and girl like that. English doesn’t make too many changes based on masculine/feminine. That is one thing that makes spanish hard for me haha
[5/5/20, 5:00:40 PM] Joe: When to say “o” or “a” kind of makes sense to me but in practice, switching between them at the right time can be a little hard
[5/5/20, 5:01:16 PM] Joe: Mostly when speaking. If I’m typing it’s easier
[5/5/20, 5:02:54 PM] Lore: Jajaj claro, dicen que el español es muy difícil ... Yo ya lo hablo y no me doy cuenta ... Menos mal jaja
[5/5/20, 5:03:56 PM] Lore: Pero para mí es raro también no poder decir la palabra sin indicar el género....

[5/5/20, 5:07:29 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[5/5/20, 5:08:53 PM] Lore: Sé lo que significa, esta frase la acabo de poner para mostrarte el ejemplo jajaja. Pero un día iba a escribirte mucho texto con el traductor y estaba la palabra de perras y no me di cuenta y cuando lo fui a revisar me hizo la traducción como bitches 😱
[5/5/20, 5:09:40 PM] Lore: Otro ejemplo diferente..
[5/5/20, 5:09:59 PM] Lore: posh (pijo en España)
[5/5/20, 5:10:12 PM] Lore: Peeeero en Uruguay pija es otra cosa

[5/5/20, 5:17:30 PM] Lore: hahaha nah, you didn't say anything weird

[5/6/20, 9:15:11 AM] Joe: Ooooh my eyes are barely open hahah

I swear he wasn’t that big a few months ago. I guess that’s what happens when all you do is eat and sleep haha
[5/6/20, 9:32:52 AM] Lore: Jajajaja pobre Oniii, pero es muy gracioso gordo...Y sus patitas muy flacas
[5/6/20, 9:37:19 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah he is a weird shape. I know you sent all those dog pics, but they’re not with you in Madrid right?

[5/6/20, 9:46:16 AM] Lore: jajajaja
[5/6/20, 9:46:57 AM] Lore: esto no me lo hubiese imaginado al empezar a hablar con vos jajaja
[5/6/20, 9:47:17 AM] Joe: At the end I’ll add a hidden “about” page. “Built by Joe. Designed by Lore” hahaha.

[5/6/20, 9:49:41 AM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/6/20, 9:50:21 AM] Joe: “Teamwork makes the dream work” I think the saying goes....or something like that 😂
[5/6/20, 9:50:43 AM] Joe: How was the course today? You figure out that leaf texture??
[5/6/20, 9:52:01 AM] Lore: jajaja si,  tus amigos siguen jugando? jaja al final todos vamos poniendo algo de nuestra parte
[5/6/20, 9:53:16 AM] Lore: but I have to tell you one thing.....🙄 the left side in red, I see it too striking. However, I like the rest! There are no more blue, red, green boxes ... just green and gray. The chat box has the same style as the user box 👌🏻
[5/6/20, 9:55:08 AM] Joe: Haha another example of me being terrible with colors!
‎[5/6/20, 10:02:04 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/6/20, 10:13:04 AM] Joe: Haha alright cool! Sounds like I have something to do today now 😂 

Yeah I was thinking the logo should be on the dice page too. Ok ok, smaller chat and logo. What should I do with the “players” make it smaller? Different color? Get rid of it? I dont knooooow
[5/6/20, 10:13:39 AM] Joe: I appreciate the thought you’re putting into this haha it really does help a lot
[5/6/20, 10:20:57 AM] Joe: I would help you with your leaf textures on 3ds Max but I have no clue how that works 😂
[5/6/20, 10:24:20 AM] Lore: jajajaja me gustaría que puedas ayudarme con eso, hoy fue frustrante también al principio, pero lo conseguí! jaja hice la entrega finalmente
[5/6/20, 10:25:02 AM] Lore: 💙🔥🎲
[5/6/20, 10:25:28 AM] Lore: De nada ☺️
[5/6/20, 10:26:20 AM] Lore: mmmmmm
[5/6/20, 10:29:23 AM] Lore: I'm thinking, this is new to me. It occurs to me that the logo, may be like an animation, when a player wins, that appears on the center screen..
‎[5/6/20, 10:30:47 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/6/20, 10:32:09 AM] Joe: Oooooh that might be difficult to make it work, but cool idea, I could see that making it a lot more dynamic and engaging
[5/6/20, 10:32:19 AM] Joe: I’ll see what I can do
[5/6/20, 11:01:12 AM] Lore: the fucking plant gives me headaches, but the previous exercises in this block were really good for us, just a mind and on a high note..
[5/6/20, 11:04:06 AM] Lore: hahah your work piles up, buddy!
[5/6/20, 11:12:25 AM] Joe: When you make something you worked really hard on or you’re proud of, send some photos
[5/6/20, 11:14:24 AM] Joe: Aaah it’s a good thing. These ideas will help make everything look complete instead of like a half finished project. Plus any tips you give me to work on are good practice for me.
[5/6/20, 11:14:57 AM] Joe: You’re definitely keeping me busy though boss haha
[5/6/20, 11:15:24 AM] Lore: jajaja
[5/6/20, 11:15:39 AM] Lore: Si, claro! te mandaré!!
[5/6/20, 11:15:56 AM] Lore: quién es el jefe? jajaja acabo de abrir photoshop
[5/6/20, 11:17:11 AM] Joe: 😂 😂
[5/6/20, 11:18:05 AM] Joe: Next it will be Adobe XD. You’ll be working from the beach in Costa Rica designing dice games on the internet hahaha
[5/6/20, 11:19:21 AM] Lore: jaja no estaría mal, venís conmigo???
[5/6/20, 11:21:25 AM] Joe: I’ll be there!

[5/6/20, 11:45:59 AM] Joe: Just kidding. It looks pretty cool. But how do people know the score?
[5/6/20, 11:46:56 AM] Joe: It definitely seems like the more simple you make it the better it looks hahaha. Less is more or something
[5/6/20, 11:46:58 AM] Lore: me falta jugadores, en lateral izquierdo
[5/6/20, 11:47:21 AM] Joe: Ooooh that’s what you meant
[5/6/20, 11:47:31 AM] Joe: Ok ok

[5/6/20, 11:49:49 AM] Joe: Hahaha soon. Very soon I promise.
[5/6/20, 11:51:27 AM] Lore: jajaja, el logo ahi arriba, puede sustituir a la animación central del logo, así no se te acumula trabajo!

[5/6/20, 11:55:44 AM] Lore: mmm habría que pensar como poner los jugadores
[5/6/20, 11:56:58 AM] Lore: hahaha I never play anything on computer (I even laughed at a friend who likes video games) I don't know how it is .. I just remember mario bross as a little hahaha
[5/6/20, 11:57:01 AM] Joe: Haha I know. It has to be somewhere you can see it though. Maybe a button so it only is like that if you want to see it, but you can also push it to make it go away
[5/6/20, 11:57:31 AM] Joe: True. Doesn’t need to be too big I guess
[5/6/20, 11:58:13 AM] Lore: chat?
[5/6/20, 11:59:13 AM] Joe: Players. I can probably make it small. I don’t know haha I guess I don’t play enough games either 😂
[5/6/20, 11:59:28 AM] Joe: I should go play some games. It will be “research”

[5/6/20, 2:13:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’s ok. I’ve been hard at work. Now all the changes you suggested are done 😂
[5/6/20, 2:13:46 PM] Joe: I’m about to build a table with my sister right now I guess. We’re staining the wood
[5/6/20, 2:15:07 PM] Lore: Muy bien quedó!

[5/7/20, 10:45:58 PM] Lore: Jjjj a que se dedica ella?
[5/7/20, 10:47:19 PM] Lore: Jajaja si increíble.. a mí me gusta despertarme con la luz.... Bueno son las 8 acá por eso me desperté temprano jaja
[5/7/20, 10:49:22 PM] Joe: She one of the managers at a jewelry store. One of those ones that let you open an oyster to get a pearl. Then they set the pearl in jewelry.
[5/7/20, 10:51:40 PM] Joe: Well they also sell jewelry without the oyster and pearl thing but I think the pearl thing is interesting haha. 

But she is always making cool stuff for fun so I’m trying to make her sell stuff and make a few bucks.
[5/7/20, 10:54:01 PM] Joe: Oh god if you think 8 is early you’d think I’m insane sometimes hahaha
[5/7/20, 10:59:44 PM] Lore: Suena interesante, seguro que se vienen muchas perlas de ostras. En que la ayudas, a vender muebles?
[5/7/20, 11:01:25 PM] Lore: Jajaja si sé que vos te despertas super temprano, yo puede que abra los ojos dos veces pero no tengo problemas de sueño, lo más pronto que puedo despertarme es a las 8 y lo máximo a las 10
[5/7/20, 11:02:45 PM] Lore: I have a "gift" for you 😊
[5/7/20, 11:05:15 PM] Joe: I just helped her make this one but I want to make her a website. My brother can do the marketing haha. She just has to make things she likes making. 


I just want to help her make money doing something she already likes to do anyway haha
[5/7/20, 11:05:27 PM] Joe: Ooooh what is it????
[5/7/20, 11:06:16 PM] Lore: Que bieen, buen equipo de hermanos!!!

[5/7/20, 11:13:15 PM] Joe: A lot of skaters call the rails with 2 side by side “shotgun” rails
[5/7/20, 11:13:18 PM] Lore: Jaja son escaleras, como la vi larga. Hay otras barandillas que tenían en la esquina un borde supongo que para que nadie patine
‎[5/7/20, 11:13:59 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/7/20, 11:14:14 PM] Joe: Yeah the stairs look so long haha. Need more height, less length to jump down without grinding the rail

[5/8/20, 6:52:46 AM] Joe: Hahaha dude I always use boring videos to fall asleep 😴 

I’ll watch some boring talk about programming or something and nod off.

[5/8/20, 6:56:59 AM] Lore: hahaha expert mode, I leave you watching your video to sleep, with programming I would fall asleep in seconds haha

I really like it here hahaha
[5/9/20, 1:19:52 AM] Joe: How are you doing today??
[5/9/20, 2:09:12 AM] Lore: Ohhhh solo un mes, y por qué no te quedas? Si al final no hay surfcamp no??
[5/9/20, 2:10:09 AM] Lore: Nada hoy sin curso, libre.. ayer me escapé a la calle jaja me hicieron un certificado de trabajo falso por si me paraba la policía y me tomé unas cervezas jajaja
[5/9/20, 2:37:34 AM] Joe: I don’t know. I’m thinking about it. I’m supposed to finish filming my next video part too though. But I definitely think I’ll end up leaving CA pretty quickly if I go back

But I bought my flight back right at the very beginning of this whole coronavirus thing so it was only $100 for my flight back.

[5/9/20, 3:06:56 AM] Lore: Chico inteligente!!!!
[5/9/20, 3:08:11 AM] Lore: You could still look for a spot in Hawaii to add to your video, and some shot skating in paradise with the flowers haha
[5/9/20, 3:12:55 AM] Joe: Haha I wish! We use a certain camera and basically my friend that puts it all together would never use footage I got of myself out here. It wouldn’t look right without the right equipment and someone to film. 

I wanted them to come out here but there is a 14 day quarantine period if you come to the island right now and they wouldn’t come for long enough for it to be worth it.
[5/9/20, 3:15:18 AM] Joe: You can’t wait to have all your freedom back 😂
[5/9/20, 3:17:36 AM] Lore: Ohhhh qué pena, sería genial. Bueno pierdes hacer alguna tomita de recuerdo ahí patinando, sabes editar?

[5/9/20, 3:35:16 AM] Lore: Y no sos repelente ni nada, hiciste un vídeo enseñando spots y como cambiar una lija, etc
[5/9/20, 3:36:15 AM] Lore: I like you the same with the videos
[5/9/20, 3:37:46 AM] Joe: Thaaaanks. I guess it’s fine that you found them as long as you don’t hold it against me hahaha
[5/9/20, 3:38:22 AM] Joe: Oh god I really felt the embarrassment on that one though 🤦‍♂️
[5/9/20, 3:39:05 AM] Joe: The “influencer” thing and the gifs ahahhaha fucker
[5/9/20, 3:39:22 AM] Lore: Jajaja noooo, solo nos reímos entre los dos
[5/9/20, 3:40:19 AM] Lore: Tuve un poco de miedo cuando los encontré, dije fuck youtuber empalagoso no por favor
[5/9/20, 3:41:42 AM] Lore: Pero no eras así para nada, aunque se nota que los hiciste hace años me pareció bueno encontrarlos y ver tus expresiones, risa jaja me gusta
[5/9/20, 3:42:41 AM] Joe: Well at least you didn’t hate the way I am in the videos haha
[5/9/20, 3:43:39 AM] Joe: Shit....I wonder how many people that meet me end up finding those videos 🤔 

I always think about putting them on private but I never do
[5/9/20, 3:45:52 AM] Lore: Para nada, se nota que sos buen pibe y simpático ( no sé esto como será en el traductor, pibe es como chico)
[5/9/20, 3:46:36 AM] Lore: Jaja no sé, no creo que mucha tampoco... Al final estás en instagram. Pero no creo que debas borrarlos

[5/9/20, 4:05:30 AM] Lore: my fucking burger is going to get cold

[5/9/20, 4:13:28 AM] Joe: Haha maybe for me. But I have a friend that loves to skate rails and he might be into that spot. I’m not much of a rail skater 😂
[5/9/20, 4:14:00 AM] Joe: It looks pretty good from that angle though
[5/9/20, 4:14:38 AM] Lore: Que te gusta a vos? Quiero aprender a verlo en la ciudad jajaja o intentarlo por lo menos
[5/9/20, 4:16:45 AM] Joe: Haha it’s hard to describe the things I like. I do like stairs but I really like “manual pads”
[5/9/20, 4:16:52 AM] Joe: And ledges or benches

Anyway, I’m going to sleep now. Talk to you later. Have a good day!
[5/9/20, 4:36:18 AM] Lore: Perdona pasó algo grave con el hermano de Sandra y estaba consolandola que llegué a casa recién.
[5/9/20, 4:37:25 AM] Lore: Este es bonito!
[5/9/20, 4:37:41 AM] Lore: Alto no?
[5/9/20, 4:39:02 AM] Lore: Me encanta! Es re lindo, con la forma de la arquitectura, colores, palmeras 😍
[5/9/20, 4:39:24 AM] Joe: Nooo worries! I’m just getting tired so I’m probably going to fall asleep in a second here haha. I can feel it coming so if I stop messaging you, you know why 😴
[5/9/20, 4:40:15 AM] Joe: It’s about perfect I would say. Not too high, not too low.
[5/9/20, 4:40:31 AM] Lore: Siii es super tarde ahí! 🐻
[5/9/20, 4:41:27 AM] Lore: Yo lo veo alto jaja perfecto para romperme un tobillo! Y no hay video de esa barandilla?
[5/9/20, 4:41:31 AM] Joe: Haha yeah that place is my nice and it has my favorite thing to skate so it’s a cool spot.
[5/9/20, 4:43:32 AM] Joe: No video of the railing 😞 I would really only skate a rail like that if I was filming with my friends. Hard to get the motivation to skate stuff like that alone
[5/9/20, 4:45:14 AM] Lore: Yo creo que ya estoy preparada para buscar spots en Madrid de bancos y repisas jajaja
[5/9/20, 4:45:40 AM] Lore: Vos tendrás que buscar cosas de diseño en Hawaii, alguna casita d esas d colores 😍
‎[5/9/20, 4:46:59 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/9/20, 4:47:21 AM] Joe: Haha yesssss you’re getting it. I’m looking forward to these pictures 😂 

And yeah, I’ll try to get photos of architecture that catches my eye.
[5/9/20, 4:47:33 AM] Lore: Claro, lo entiendo!
[5/9/20, 4:48:21 AM] Joe: Those are cute. I see what kind of small houses you like haha. I’ll send photos when I see them
[5/9/20, 4:49:32 AM] Lore: Jajaja buen trueque!
[5/9/20, 4:49:46 AM] Lore: Te dejo dormir Joe, que es tarde y me vas a matar! Jajaja
[5/9/20, 4:51:00 AM] Joe: Hahaha alright alright maybe I should sleep. You’re waking me back up!
[5/9/20, 4:51:40 AM] Joe: I don’t have anything planned tomorrow so it’s ok haha. No worries.
[5/9/20, 4:51:46 AM] Lore: Jajaja si ahora te vas a dormir pensando en patinar. Dulces sueños con Oni, un beso! 😘😘
[5/9/20, 4:52:04 AM] Lore: Hablame luego!! 😚

[5/9/20, 11:25:44 AM] Lore: El que, el justificante?
[5/9/20, 11:29:57 AM] Joe: YouTube haha. I couldn’t believe it when you said you already watched some of them 🤦‍♂️ 

I could feel my cheeks turning red and that doesn’t happen to me....ever
[5/9/20, 11:32:39 AM] Lore: Ah mierda claro es que tu noche fue hoy mi mañana
[5/9/20, 11:33:48 AM] Joe: Oh yeah, my last night hahaha
[5/9/20, 11:34:24 AM] Lore: Hahaha really?  I was quiet, as I saw that you're ashamed of some things ... and so you don't think I'm crazy hahaha

[5/9/20, 11:38:36 AM] Joe: Haha yes really
[5/9/20, 11:38:51 AM] Joe: Hahahaha!
[5/9/20, 11:39:41 AM] Joe: All you had to say was you found them. I know what the videos are like so once you said you saw a few I could only imagine which ones and how bad they are hahaha
[5/9/20, 11:40:19 AM] Lore: Jajaja pensá que no entiendo lo que estás diciendo

[5/9/20, 11:46:46 AM] Joe: Good thing there are no spanish subtitles hahah
[5/9/20, 11:48:15 AM] Joe: Oh fuck, YouTube added auto-translate hahahahahaha
[5/9/20, 11:57:35 AM] Joe: Ok, time to go skate. Hit me up later. 

Don’t find anything else of me on the internet while I’m out
[5/9/20, 12:43:40 PM] Lore: La compañera, la loca....me pilló para hablar y no me dejaba en paz, que pesada!!!!

[5/9/20, 1:09:13 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 whyyyyyyyyy
[5/9/20, 1:10:57 PM] Joe: Lots of Joe Villavicencio content on YouTube haha I can’t believe I ever get jobs 😂
[5/9/20, 1:11:55 PM] Lore: Jijiji your family is fan of the paddington bear
[5/9/20, 1:17:58 PM] Joe: Haha she knows I have the paddington tattoo so that’s probably why.


But it is a Peruvian bear that goes to England so it’s definitely got some family meaning to it for me. 

People always think it’s weird when they see I have a paddington tattoo until I explain that part to them 😂
[5/9/20, 1:20:00 PM] Lore: jajaja si, para mi era extraño también, hasta que me lo explicaste, y todo tiene sentido!
[5/9/20, 1:22:18 PM] Lore: ohhh... oh... jaja acabo de darme cuenta que hay dos cuentas de Youtube con tu nombre
‎[5/9/20, 1:22:37 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/9/20, 1:23:31 PM] Joe: FUCK
[5/9/20, 1:24:35 PM] Joe: Ok if you found me flying airplanes you might as well see what it looked like when I got really good at it hahaha
[5/9/20, 1:24:59 PM] Joe: I was sponsored and this dude gave me free airplanes to fly 😂 

https://youtu.be/kcLqWzNJFXM
[5/9/20, 1:25:34 PM] Joe: I only got into it because I hurt my ankle so bad skating that I couldn’t really skate for almost a year. DONT JUDGE ME!!!!!
[5/9/20, 1:25:54 PM] Joe: I needed something to do hahah oh fuck me god dammit
[5/9/20, 1:26:29 PM] Lore: JAJAJAJAJA
[5/9/20, 1:27:16 PM] Lore: Sorry, but it amuses me. Whenever I see some boy or old man with a boat or plane, I laugh a little
[5/9/20, 1:27:56 PM] Joe: Ok I’m going to go die of shame now, thanks hahahahaha
[5/9/20, 1:29:43 PM] Lore: I remember that once in a job, we sold many decoration products, and one of them was a helicopter but it worked well, and it became a top seller. haha many boys came to buy it, in the end they gave us one, I went to try it in a field, and I stamped it against a curb...
[5/9/20, 1:29:52 PM] Lore: jajaja noooo, solo estoy bromeando Joe!
[5/9/20, 1:31:08 PM] Lore: I don't have the experience to give much opinion, but I think it flies well! 🔥🛩️
[5/9/20, 1:33:40 PM] Joe: Haha it felt like skateboarding to me. Trying to make the plane look like it’s doing tricks with style. Making it dance in the sky. Plus it felt like doing flip tricks on a skateboard. Flip the plane fast and try to stop it at the right time and fly away smooth. It was fun 🤷‍♂️
[5/9/20, 1:33:51 PM] Joe: I don’t have planes anymore though haha
[5/9/20, 1:36:09 PM] Lore: jajaj si parece complicado!! y eso, por que ya no tenés aviones?
[5/9/20, 1:39:11 PM] Joe: Partly because my ankle got better and I could finally skate again....and partly because the dude that was giving me free planes suddenly passes away and that I a CRAZY expensive hobby. Definitely couldn’t have flown those big ones if they weren’t free hahaha

You’re finding some quality stuff there hahah
[5/9/20, 1:41:46 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️
[5/9/20, 1:42:18 PM] Joe: I get free skateboard stuff too hahaha
[5/9/20, 1:42:27 PM] Joe: People like to give me things I guess

[5/9/20, 3:54:20 PM] Joe: Hahahaha good memes!
[5/9/20, 3:56:31 PM] Joe: I saw a few more episodes the other day. It’s definitely my favorite show right now. Great recommendation 👍 

It just gets crazier and crazier. I think the last episode I saw was when Nairobi gets shot and the bodyguard guy gets free.
[5/9/20, 3:59:13 PM] Lore: 😱😱😱
[5/9/20, 3:59:27 PM] Lore: Ya estás casi en el final, eso es de la última temporada
[5/9/20, 3:59:52 PM] Lore: Odio al calvo de seguridad es un hijo de puta
[5/9/20, 4:15:42 PM] Joe: Whaaat!? Am I on the last already? I though it was the second to last. Damn. I better slow down haha
[5/9/20, 4:18:01 PM] Joe: Yeah that security dude is an asshole, so is that new dude that was in charge before Tokyo took over. 

It was so wild when they were putting Nairobi to sleep to do surgery and she was like, “no no noooo don’t put me to sleep”. They would’ve felt so bad if she never woke up 😬
[5/9/20, 8:59:06 PM] Lore: Última temporada, no capítulo jjj
[5/9/20, 9:00:41 PM] Lore: No puedo creer, me acabo de depertar a esta hora ...mierda
[5/9/20, 9:01:40 PM] Joe: Hahaha go back to sleep. Too early for you
[5/9/20, 9:02:52 PM] Lore: No puedo! Llevo un rato en la cama diciendo no, no.. seguí con los ojos cerrados
[5/9/20, 9:03:47 PM] Joe: Oh I know that feeling 😂
[5/9/20, 9:04:10 PM] Joe: I just watched some more and uuuuh Nairobi is dead 😢
[5/9/20, 9:04:27 PM] Lore: Ohhhhhh
[5/9/20, 9:04:59 PM] Joe: She was my favorite dammit
[5/9/20, 9:05:01 PM] Lore: Que hijo de puta eh? Da mucha rabia ... Un tiro en la cabeza
[5/9/20, 9:05:44 PM] Joe: While talking shit too. Ugh damn
[5/9/20, 9:06:08 PM] Lore: Ohhh !!! Ella es genial, su acento y carácter, muy divertidaa
[5/9/20, 9:06:11 PM] Joe: And they get you all hyped up cause she trying to make babies haha
[5/9/20, 9:06:40 PM] Joe: Hell yeah she was tiiiiiight
[5/9/20, 9:06:40 PM] Lore: Si, si... Muy sucio ese juego
[5/9/20, 9:07:36 PM] Lore: Jajaj si me reí mucho cuando intenta convencer al profesor para que sea el padre de sus hijos
[5/9/20, 9:09:38 PM] Joe: Haha me too. That shit was hella funny. Bogota was about to seal the deal instead though 😂
[5/9/20, 9:09:50 PM] Joe: But then she died 😔
[5/9/20, 9:10:14 PM] Joe: Now I don’t like your recommendation anymore. How could they kill Nairobi!?

[5/9/20, 9:10:51 PM] Lore: Jajajjajajaja
[5/9/20, 9:12:11 PM] Lore: A mí no me gustó... pero tenía que pasar.. todo lo que pasa luego es mejor
[5/9/20, 9:13:09 PM] Lore: El profesor toma decisiones, hacen equipo y dan ganas de venganza jaja
[5/9/20, 9:16:09 PM] Lore: Me gusta mucho el personaje de Palermo....es un hijo de puta pero luego él se enoja mucho cuando matan a Nairobi... Parece más humano y muy decidido a matar al calvo
[5/9/20, 9:19:21 PM] Joe: Haha I’m on the fence with Palermo. He was upset when she died..but she wouldn’t have died at all if it wasn’t for him. 


I guess I like how eccentric that character is 🤷‍♂️
[5/9/20, 9:19:33 PM] Joe: And good, I’m trying to see some revenge go down
[5/9/20, 9:23:37 PM] Lore: Síii, jaja y que palabras o frases aprendiste en la serie? Te escucho👂
[5/9/20, 9:25:16 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn

[5/9/20, 9:28:26 PM] Joe: Haha shit
[5/9/20, 9:29:16 PM] Joe: 🤔 damn I’m really trying to think. Next time I’ll write it down or message you so I don’t forget.
[5/9/20, 9:29:23 PM] Joe: You give me something

[5/9/20, 9:39:12 PM] Joe: Say just “personaje” so I can hear it better

[5/9/20, 9:43:32 PM] Lore: Nunca había visto fotos a esta hora jajaja
[5/9/20, 9:44:18 PM] Joe: Kind of. It’s a little bit of a G mixed with an H
[5/9/20, 9:46:07 PM] Joe: Haha I literally ran out the front door to grab some pictures when I saw the sun setting through the window 😂
[5/9/20, 9:46:51 PM] Joe: Cause I always miss the sunset by a few minutes haha. Not today!
[5/9/20, 9:48:25 PM] Lore: 🧐
[5/9/20, 9:50:50 PM] Lore: Jaja re lindo, y que haces en casa?
[5/9/20, 9:51:14 PM] Joe: Hahah I don’t know. But it’s that kind of back of the throat sound you make when you say it that I’m missing even if I technically say it right. It still sounds wrong haha

[5/9/20, 10:01:06 PM] Joe: Hahaha too bad I can’t make you some. Too far.

[5/9/20, 10:05:21 PM] Joe: You make me nervous haha. Should I be nervous? You’re trying to lure me into a trap?? With pancakes??
[5/9/20, 10:05:31 PM] Joe: Cause it’s working hahah
[5/9/20, 10:06:17 PM] Lore: Jajajaja estoy intentando seducirte

[5/9/20, 10:09:11 PM] Joe: 😂 we still don’t know who is trapping who yet
[5/9/20, 10:09:20 PM] Joe: To be continued....

[5/9/20, 10:14:52 PM] Joe: Just let me know when your plan to murder me is ready and I’ll come out to visit you
[5/9/20, 10:15:55 PM] Lore: Jaja a vos no!

[5/9/20, 10:26:53 PM] Lore: ???
[5/9/20, 10:29:36 PM] Joe: You tempting me with all this talk of pancakes and pictures from your bed hahaha

[5/9/20, 10:41:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/9/20, 10:43:41 PM] Lore: Pregunta, sos cariñoso?
[5/9/20, 10:45:43 PM] Joe: Haha what do you mean by that?
[5/9/20, 10:46:17 PM] Joe: I’m pretty affectionate if I’m comfortable. Very affectionate actually
[5/9/20, 10:51:32 PM] Joe: Hmmm I want to describe what I’m like when I really care about someone but I don’t want to seem weird haha. Fuck. I guess it’s me though


Ok. Only a few people have seen my intimate side but when I care for someone It feels intense for me. I like to spend time or talk with only a few people so they end up being the ones I share everything with. 

I don’t know. At this point I just want to be happy and I want whoever I’m with to be happy.
[5/9/20, 10:53:35 PM] Joe: Hopefully you understand what I’m trying to say and I don’t seem weird hahaha fuck.
[5/9/20, 10:56:16 PM] Joe: Also I’ll lay in bed with you all day long if that’s what you mean hahaha
[5/9/20, 10:56:32 PM] Lore: Nada raro, de hecho me parece que elegiste muy buenas palabras para describirlo, muy bonita la frase final. Me gusta tu panera de pensar ☺️
[5/9/20, 10:57:55 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. It’s hard to describe stuff like that in a message. 

What about you? Are you very affectionate? What do you like?
[5/9/20, 10:57:57 PM] Lore: 😳 Is Joe the one who says this? Hahaha

[5/9/20, 11:03:43 PM] Lore: Mmmm.. ahora entiendo lo rara que es mi pregunta.. 

Pero si, soy cariñosa. Bastante, si me siento cómoda. De hecho comprobé que hay una gran diferencia ... Puedo ser como otra persona si no me gusta realmente alguien, arggg que difícil jaja ...

Tampoco soy una garrapata, jaja no soy de esas que se da mil besos en público, pero si soy cariñosa si un chico me gusta y con los animales
[5/9/20, 11:04:28 PM] Lore: (bueno con mi familia y amigas también.. jaja pero con chicos y animales más 😅🙈)
[5/9/20, 11:07:58 PM] Joe: Hahah the part about kissing in public is funny. I’m like that. It’s only for me and you 😂 

Yeah i probably didn’t completely understand what you meant by the question so I just explained as much as I can.
[5/9/20, 11:11:32 PM] Joe: I just smoked a little while ago and now you got me thinking super hard about the way I am with other people/people I like haha


Stoned thoughts 💭
[5/9/20, 11:14:22 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, odio cuando encuentro en el metro por la mañana adolescentes que hacen ruido al besarse

[5/9/20, 11:18:19 PM] Lore: hahaha good combination!
[5/9/20, 11:22:29 PM] Joe: You being so far away is a little annoying right now hahaha fuck. I don’t like what you’re doing to me. I’m not supposed to tell anyone anything about me 😂 

I was supposed to be secluded on this island and no one would notice me hahaha
[5/9/20, 11:23:12 PM] Joe: And now I’m telling you about how I would lay in bed with you all day hahah but your bed is too far!!!

[5/9/20, 11:30:56 PM] Lore: marijuana is making you drop words, fine!  hahaha if I would like you to be in my bed, or me in yours.  

Dear unknown, but so the time difference would be solved for example 🙄 hahaha
[5/9/20, 11:35:02 PM] Joe: I just wanted to try living out here. I lived in California all my life. In the Bay Area. There’s so many people there and life is fast paced, everyone trying to hustle and get by cause it’s expensive. I kind of was getting tired of it. 

Island life is slower. Relaxed. Less pressure. Plus it’s beautiful.
[5/9/20, 11:35:36 PM] Joe: Haha one day I swear!
[5/9/20, 11:42:02 PM] Lore: Buena elección, "pura vida", lo escuchaste alguna vez?

[5/9/20, 11:47:23 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/9/20, 11:48:06 PM] Joe: No I haven’t heard that before but I like the translation. That’s what I want.
[5/10/20, 12:00:22 AM] Lore: Pura vida en Costa Rica es un saludo( hola, adiós, como estás, todo bien?) 
 Ellos lo dicen continuamente.. como ahí Aloha por ejemplo...
Costa Rica está entre los países más felices del mundo.. y el significado de "pura vida" es como... vida relajada, energía positiva, sin estrés, disfrutando de la vida
[5/10/20, 12:06:54 AM] Joe: Aah ok I get it. That’s really cool. I should check out Costa Rica. Sounds amazing and like they appreciate the slow life like here. I have to improve my spanish haha. Then we can meet in Costa Rica 😂

I’m almost finished fixing that security problem with the passwords. Sooo close. I think haha.
[5/10/20, 12:59:17 AM] Lore: mmm looking at random things like Amazon, Youtube, bikinis, design.. haha
[5/10/20, 1:00:43 AM] Lore: I'm testing
[5/10/20, 1:01:35 AM] Lore: it looks good!!
[5/10/20, 1:02:12 AM] Joe: Haha sounds fun. Some morning internet browsing and breakfast ☕️ 🍳 

Testing what?
[5/10/20, 1:02:27 AM] Lore: what a change the dice game made!
[5/10/20, 1:02:54 AM] Joe: Haha thanks. I made the winner animate in when the game is done too. Thanks for the suggestion haha
[5/10/20, 1:03:11 AM] Joe: Ooh testing my game haha. Cool
[5/10/20, 1:04:17 AM] Lore: Me hace ilusión ver los cambios, todos los detalles. jaja mientras hablabamos por whatsapp
[5/10/20, 1:04:29 AM] Joe: There are a few things that got messed up like the size and alignment of my buttons but its overall better. 

I don’t know how my buttons moved 😂
[5/10/20, 1:05:12 AM] Joe: My design consultant from Spain
[5/10/20, 1:05:41 AM] Lore: hiciste más pequeño el logo, queda mejor!
[5/10/20, 1:07:01 AM] Lore: 🤭
[5/10/20, 1:07:06 AM] Joe: I mean you said it would be better if it was smaller so I tried it out haha
[5/10/20, 1:07:13 AM] Lore: Video

[5/10/20, 1:13:34 AM] Joe: Haha oh I guess I didn’t do it how you imagined. It just comes from the side. I’ll add some falling confetti and make it bounce or something hahaha
‎[5/10/20, 1:14:07 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 1:14:38 AM] Joe: It needs to be better! Give all the suggestions. I told you I’m terrible at design. I just think it’s funny. You have the eye and you like to do it so you can’t help yourself hahah
[5/10/20, 1:15:42 AM] Lore: Voy!
‎[5/10/20, 1:17:32 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/10/20, 1:18:25 AM] Joe: Sooo winner used to just suddenly appear after every game. Now it slides from the right and the logo moves up. Right?
[5/10/20, 1:20:50 AM] Joe: But like I said I’ll add more animation haha. Confetti and bouncing “winner” or something
[5/10/20, 1:20:53 AM] Lore: Jajaja es que así se ve toda la info en una pantalla sin quedarse nada oculto abajo.  Si, disfruto de la maquetación y los detalles jjj. 

Si en algún momento te molesta, por favor decimelo!
[5/10/20, 1:22:13 AM] Lore: Ahhhhh ahora lo ví!
[5/10/20, 1:22:49 AM] Joe: Not even close to being bothered by it
[5/10/20, 1:23:11 AM] Joe: I’ll move everything up a little bit
[5/10/20, 1:31:55 AM] Lore: siii, simplemente un poquito para que no quede cortado
[5/10/20, 1:32:18 AM] Lore: Joe, te gusta el diseño/ arquitectura?
[5/10/20, 1:35:21 AM] Joe: I do. Why? I’m not good at design but I’ve been trying to learn. And I appreciate unique architecture when I see it for sure. I used to drive around and just look at houses for no reason hahah
[5/10/20, 1:37:43 AM] Lore: para mostrarte un video, de mis proyectos preferidos, es un arquitecto español, con una filosofía que me encanta, el trabajó la arquitectura e interiorismo, como un todo.. a mi me encantan los lugares abanonados, por la altura de techos, etc

[5/10/20, 1:40:38 AM] Joe: Woooaah that’s fucking awesome haha
[5/10/20, 1:41:13 AM] Lore: Sorry, I meant you had the subtitles below to understand it

[5/10/20, 1:57:45 AM] Lore: Si, es increíble. Me encantaría vivir ahí!
[5/10/20, 6:04:52 AM] Joe: Sorry I fell asleep out of nowhere on the couch 😐 I just woke up not knowing where the hell I was at hahaha. 

Anyway, that dudes work is awesome and you should send me more stuff that you like when can. 

I’m going to try to go back to sleep now. Too early haha. Talk to you later. Un beso

[5/10/20, 3:30:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks! I just did what you suggested. Definitely gives the site a better look/feel
‎[5/10/20, 3:30:53 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/10/20, 3:32:32 PM] Joe: Yeah I didn’t like the way the dice would move all over the place after you pick one. Sometime it would make you choose the wrong dice because they’d move after you pick one up. Now they animate off the screen after you pick one but the remaining dice stay still
[5/10/20, 3:32:39 PM] Lore: Jaja sí, entre los dos fuimos dando un poco más de forma al original jaja recuerdo todavía como era jaja creo que tenemos una foto
[5/10/20, 3:33:43 PM] Lore: if it is true, good change!
[5/10/20, 3:33:53 PM] Joe: Haha let me see the photo. It was butt ugly when I first showed you 😂
[5/10/20, 3:34:14 PM] Joe: Gracias 🙃
[5/10/20, 3:34:19 PM] Lore: Pero se puede elegir más de uno en la misma partida, eso también lo cambiaste no?
‎[5/10/20, 3:35:55 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/10/20, 3:35:56 PM] Joe: 🤔 no I don’t think I changed anything like that. You could always pick up one or more after each roll
[5/10/20, 3:36:23 PM] Joe: Hah yesssss. Small details haha

[5/10/20, 3:46:04 PM] Lore: Digo que no recordaba que la de página de inicio
[5/10/20, 3:46:14 PM] Joe: Extra large one haha

[5/10/20, 3:48:36 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/10/20, 3:49:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I got way too into making this game. It’s been really good practice though. I’ve learned about a bunch of stuff I’ve never used before to make this one.
[5/10/20, 3:50:05 PM] Joe: Very fun but also frustrating at times haha

[5/10/20, 3:53:20 PM] Joe: fine whatever hahahahaha
[5/10/20, 3:56:26 PM] Lore: if in the end, you spent hours, and greatly improved the changes. Although I know you were frustrated at times, I am so glad you are at this point!
[5/10/20, 3:58:14 PM] Joe: The funny thing is I was going to stop at the point where it worked. I just wanted to play with my friends. 

But then they asked if I could make the dice look like dice. And the one friend asked if he could draw a logo. And you started making suggestions. Team effort hahah
[5/10/20, 3:59:01 PM] Joe: Most features were requested by others. I just built it haha
[5/10/20, 4:00:32 PM] Lore: I love that team, haha ​​what a good unknown friend! now you can play better with your friends!
[5/10/20, 4:07:44 PM] Joe: Yeah now I just need to come up with more ideas that they like so they’ll help me with ideas haha


Right now I’m trying to build a generic e-commerce site so they can all just drop in their art or clothing they want to sell and some images and have a working site. That’s been going a lot slower haha
[5/10/20, 4:46:13 PM] Lore: Me había quedado dormida! Jaja acabo de abrir los ojos
[5/10/20, 4:47:49 PM] Joe: Haha that’s ok it’s late there. You probably have the course tomorrow too. You should get some rest
[5/10/20, 4:48:02 PM] Lore: Mm quiero verla luego esa web?
[5/10/20, 4:48:28 PM] Lore: Mmm
[5/10/20, 4:48:51 PM] Joe: Haha I’ll show you eventually. It’s supposed to be very minimal. Just enough to sell some items
[5/10/20, 4:48:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha

[5/10/20, 4:55:38 PM] Joe: So when I find out summer camp is canceled....what do you want to do??
[5/10/20, 4:59:12 PM] Lore: just kidding? Hahaha
[5/10/20, 5:00:22 PM] Joe: Uuuuuuh suuuure if you want me to be just kidding 😬
‎[5/10/20, 5:01:22 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:03:10 PM] Lore: hahaha I'm asleep and could imagine various things. So tell us, what would we do?
[5/10/20, 5:05:58 PM] Joe: Well...it depends. Are you tied down in Madrid? I could go anywhere really 🤷‍♂️
[5/10/20, 5:07:35 PM] Joe: Also depends on what you’d want. Would you want to meet me for a short while like a a few weeks or longer or shorter? Or not at all hahaha

I have no reason to be in any place in particular so I can do whatever you like
[5/10/20, 5:08:48 PM] Joe: I’ll get those cool new headphones with the built in translator 😂 😂
[5/10/20, 5:10:08 PM] Joe: Or you can just meet me back in Hawaii after summer haha
[5/10/20, 5:12:40 PM] Lore: I was in shock, hahaha a few seconds but with a smile on my face
[5/10/20, 5:17:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know...like you said, you’re a 31 year old woman...and I’m a 30 year old man. 

We can do whatever we want with our lives. But you it’s up to you. I’ll be ok with getting lost in the anywhere in the world with you.
[5/10/20, 5:17:49 PM] Joe: Sounds fun
[5/10/20, 5:19:35 PM] Joe: Haha sorry maybe you should sleep on it and answer later
‎[5/10/20, 5:23:49 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:24:51 PM] Lore: I think I could fall asleep, but with this my eyes are now super open! hahaha
[5/10/20, 5:26:54 PM] Lore: I'm not tied to Madrid, in fact I want to travel and learn English!
[5/10/20, 5:27:56 PM] Lore: although I think you could also buy me the translator headset hahah
[5/10/20, 5:27:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what you expected when you’re trying to lure me in 😂 


But yeah no pressure to answer now. Just think about it
[5/10/20, 5:29:21 PM] Joe: It was hard to ask haha. I’ve been thinking about it recently though and I don’t see why not. Am I just going to message you on WhatsApp forever? Or ask you to go on an adventure?
[5/10/20, 5:29:47 PM] Lore: suena genial Joe, jaja me pongo nerviosa ...ahora soy yo.. jajaja
[5/10/20, 5:31:10 PM] Joe: Take your time. And I won’t be crushed if you say no. But I would love if you said yes. I understand it’s kind of crazy.
[5/10/20, 5:32:28 PM] Joe: Seriously...answer in a day or two. Or a week or a month. When you’re ready. But think about it
‎[5/10/20, 5:34:25 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/10/20, 5:35:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah fuck yeah. We’ll get you there. That’s no problem at all.
[5/10/20, 5:37:23 PM] Joe: Looks like Hawaii hahaha. Gives you plenty of time to change your mind. I’m excited though
‎[5/10/20, 5:38:05 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:39:16 PM] Joe: Sorry if I woke you with my question hahaha
[5/10/20, 5:42:11 PM] Lore: are you as crazy as me ???haha I didn't t expect this question ... I will adopt the Hawaii schedule, how can I sleep today? hahaha I smoked and this is not real?
‎[5/10/20, 5:44:14 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:44:40 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha!!
[5/10/20, 5:45:03 PM] Joe: Honestly this would be the craziest thing I’ve ever done haha

I hope you’re not too crazy and I’m getting myself into trouble here 😂
[5/10/20, 5:48:12 PM] Joe: Is there anything I should know now? Hahaha

Now you make me nervous 🤔
‎[5/10/20, 5:48:25 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:49:10 PM] Lore: hahaha no, I told you everything from the beginning that I started talking to you!
[5/10/20, 5:51:18 PM] Joe: Alright alright. Well i guess you should start working on your English in that case haha.
[5/10/20, 5:54:12 PM] Joe: If you change your mind when you aren’t so stoned let me know 😂 

Even though I joke around, I took asking you about this seriously. If you knew me for a long time you would not expect anything like this from me at all. I didn’t expect it sooo i don’t know.
[5/10/20, 5:54:15 PM] Joe: Go to sleep hahaha
[5/10/20, 5:55:23 PM] Lore: no puedo dormirrrrrrrr
‎[5/10/20, 5:57:03 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/10/20, 5:57:22 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[5/10/20, 5:57:45 PM] Joe: I’m sorry! I should’ve asked at a better time. I forget about the time difference haha
[5/10/20, 5:59:00 PM] Lore: I'm not going to change my mind haha, you said I was going to get tired and I was going to stop talking to you 2 days and look ...
[5/10/20, 6:00:53 PM] Joe: That’s true. I’m shocked
[5/10/20, 6:04:05 PM] Lore: jaja pero en que momento pensaste esto? no imaginaba ni por un segundo que te lo hubieses planteado... lo comentaste con alguien??
[5/10/20, 6:05:19 PM] Lore: yo por un momento pensaba ir a california a la granja de marihuana asi podía verte jajaja
[5/10/20, 6:06:36 PM] Joe: Mmmm no I haven’t talked about it with anyone. It was probably about a week ago when I started considering it. When I realized I wake up and send you a message. Like i told you, i don’t talk to people. I’m fine with going long periods of time without talking and being comfortable with it. But I really like to talk to you
[5/10/20, 6:07:59 PM] Joe: Haha hey that’s always an option too 😂 you probably like the island better though.
[5/10/20, 6:12:01 PM] Joe: You have an attitude about life that I like. I like that you are outgoing and reached out to me in the first place. It’s like to tell you things or joke with you in ways that I’m sure are going to make you stop talking to me but you don’t. You seem fun. Lighthearted. I’m down for that
[5/10/20, 6:16:38 PM] Lore: jaja esto es algo que me cuesta imaginar, que no hables con la gente...conmigo hablas mucho! desde el día que te hablé, hablamos todos los días, excepto un día! jaja
[5/10/20, 6:17:31 PM] Lore: Segurooo, pero yo no sé si podría entrar en Estados Unidos, Trump... seguro pone problemas con la visa para Uruguay!
[5/10/20, 6:18:39 PM] Joe: Fuck my life 🤦‍♂️
[5/10/20, 6:19:18 PM] Joe: Well if you can’t come here. We can go somewhere else haha.
[5/10/20, 6:23:00 PM] Lore: Ohhh gracias! jjj a mi me gusta tu forma de ser, muy reservado y tímido al principio... eso consiguió que me interese más por vos... y hablamos muchas horas, siento que puedo compartirte cualquier cosa, intentas entenderme e interesarte!
[5/10/20, 6:25:11 PM] Lore: mmmm no entiendo, por que pénsas que iba a dejar de hablarte por bromas o algo así? a mi me gustas así!
[5/10/20, 6:26:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you slowly pulled me out of my shell. You can definitely tell me anything. I’d like to know more but I never know what to ask haha
[5/10/20, 6:28:03 PM] Joe: Haha damn I am keeping you up all night tonight. Whoops 😬
[5/10/20, 6:33:21 PM] Lore: jajaja si, lentamente... duro trabajo! jajaja te intentaba sacar algunas palabras más, pero siempre eras muy educado jajaja pero me das los buenos días casi todos los días, entonces eso hizo que siga intentandolo jajaja
[5/10/20, 6:35:06 PM] Lore: Yes I hate you. I never have sleep problemsssss hahaha today I woke up at 6am and spoke with you, and now it's almost 4 and I don't see sleeping easily. hahaha thank goodness I took a nap today, while you establish sleeping in your night.
[5/10/20, 6:35:46 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[5/10/20, 6:36:14 PM] Joe: In a few months, all our time difference problems can be solved hopefully
[5/10/20, 6:37:05 PM] Joe: Good thing you kept trying haha
[5/10/20, 6:39:43 PM] Lore: jajaja okey, creo que voy a intentar dormirme, mañana me tendré que inyectar el café jajaja
[5/10/20, 6:40:14 PM] Lore: pero mereció la pena, gracias por contarme todo lo que pensabas!!
[5/10/20, 6:41:15 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok sounds good. No problem. I had fun telling it all. 

Talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
[5/10/20, 6:45:14 PM] Lore: sii era una bromaaaa todo esto, dejame un mensaje y lo leere mañana! jajaaj
[5/10/20, 6:48:21 PM] Joe: No joke. No seré pinocho haha. Sleep well

[5/11/20, 11:28:43 AM] Joe: My natural instinct is to say it like Lore kind of like Lorie or Lor

[5/11/20, 12:31:01 PM] Joe: https://youtu.be/GLmfQSR3EI0
[5/11/20, 12:36:08 PM] Joe: I don’t understand half of what that chick is saying so it’s probably a bunch of nonsense to you ahaha
[5/11/20, 12:36:16 PM] Lore: Jajaj habla muy rápido 🤯
[5/11/20, 12:36:32 PM] Joe: Yeah and a lot of the words aren’t even English
[5/11/20, 12:36:32 PM] Lore: Menos mal

[5/11/20, 12:44:27 PM] Lore: Jaja exacto a el momento que intenté entender el video que me enviaste
[5/11/20, 12:50:25 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah it’s a little much. I’m still trying to understand it completely. My cousins talk like that sometimes so I get to practice often
[5/11/20, 1:15:36 PM] Lore: jjj este es tu año de los idiomas!
[5/11/20, 1:20:59 PM] Joe: Hahah hopefully it doesn’t turn into some weird mixture of them all where I’m getting all of the  languages wrong 😆
[5/11/20, 1:25:17 PM] Lore: haha don't think negativeee, it will take time to understand them ... you know that I will help you with Spanish, and you will learn much more than when you were little! 😅
[5/11/20, 1:33:56 PM] Joe: Haha I know I know. I’m pretty determined to learn this time. Honestly I wasn’t taught much when I was little, only by my grandparents. My dad didn’t teach me anything and my mom only speaks English. 

Then when I took spanish classes in high school i resented he fact that I didn’t already speak Spanish and didn’t really want to put in the effort to learn at that point. It was almost embarrassing to try since I felt like I should already know it. 

But I’m over that hahah. I’m down to start from the bottom and feel like a dummy until I understand.
[5/11/20, 3:16:17 PM] Lore: Ey estaba cenando!
[5/11/20, 3:24:09 PM] Joe: No hay problema. Cómo estuvo la cena?
[5/11/20, 3:37:50 PM] Lore: Bien con Sandra, que está pasando por un momento complicado... Hace dos días la mujer de su hermano se volvió loca y lo denuncio por una discusión, y durmió toda la noche en la cárcel... Y tienen un hijo en común.. la chica se inventó cosas para hacerle daño y es todo mentira, una hija de puta
[5/11/20, 3:41:40 PM] Lore: tu papá habla español entonces? jaja a mi me pasa un poco igual, mi madre habla inglés, siempre le gustó y da clases también, pero a mi de pequeña no me interesó y ahora me arrepiento.. jaja pero bueno, ahora tenemos interés y ganas de aprender, y si nos esforzamos, seguramente en unos años podremos comunicarnos bien! jajaja
[5/11/20, 3:43:03 PM] Joe: Damn sound like a tough situation. That’s rough.
[5/11/20, 3:46:15 PM] Joe: Haha I think my dad grew up in the US in a time where speaking Spanish wasn’t really popular. I don’t know, my grandma always told me he was embarrassed when she would speak Spanish to him in front of his friends when he was younger. He would tell her to speak English to him haha. I think he just wanted to be super American or something 🤷‍♂️
[5/11/20, 3:46:58 PM] Joe: But he speaks Spanish great. I’ll embarrass the fuck out of myself if I try to speak to him in Spanish hahaha
[5/11/20, 3:49:31 PM] Lore: si, una mierda... yo intentó animarla, le cocinó, invitó a cerveza, hablamos, ahora parece que esta mejor, su hermano tiene un abogado.
[5/11/20, 3:50:50 PM] Lore: ohh what a shame, if I can imagine ...
[5/11/20, 3:51:51 PM] Lore: nunca te habla español? si el escucha, que estas hablando alguna palabra de español, se sorprendería? o con el hablas un poco?
[5/11/20, 3:53:41 PM] Joe: Nope, never. 

He would probably just laugh and correct whatever I say wrong or respond with so much I won’t understand all of it. Just my guess though hahah.
[5/11/20, 3:55:57 PM] Joe: I probably wouldn’t even try to talk to him in spanish until I’ve felt confident in my ability for years hahaha. Not even going to do it. I don’t show him much of what I do 😂
[5/11/20, 3:58:04 PM] Lore: ohhh por que no? el no te va a juzgar, seguro se alegra de que estes aprendiendo español, incluso hacerle gracia que estes viendo una serie en versión original
[5/11/20, 3:58:59 PM] Lore: Si algún día voy a California...y conozco a tu padre por casualidad, podré hablar con el español!!!!! jajaja
[5/11/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I guess he’d be happy. He would probably say something like, “you can get paid more now because you speak two languages” haha. Fucking dads 😂
[5/11/20, 4:00:46 PM] Joe: Oh god Hahahaha
[5/11/20, 4:02:23 PM] Joe: My dad would probably say so much shit to embarrass me knowing I won’t understand half of what he is telling you hahaha fuuuck
[5/11/20, 4:02:29 PM] Joe: I better learn quick
[5/11/20, 4:04:11 PM] Lore: Is right! my mother always told me. We will also say it in the future! Hahaha

But when this one is done if you have some random shit you want to sell online let me know.
[5/11/20, 4:14:36 PM] Joe: And you don’t really have to give me tips. I’m just working on this right now and wanted to show you 👨‍💻
[5/11/20, 4:16:11 PM] Lore: jajaja Joe, si yo no tengo ni idea. pero casi siempre me gusta opinar.. cuando hay algo relacionado con tema gráfico jajaja, tengo que hacer algún curso
[5/11/20, 4:16:33 PM] Lore: esa es la web que estas haciendo para tu amigo no? tiene buena pinta, pasame el link
[5/11/20, 4:17:55 PM] Lore: jajaja gracias, si vendo algo en algún momento, y necesito una web, te avisaré para que me ayudes!! jjjj
[5/11/20, 4:19:44 PM] Joe: Haha if you have an eye for what looks good in a room or on a wall, it’s very similar. It’s mostly about placement and relationships between the items on the screen to create the feeling you want. Drawing the eye to the important details and making the less important things a little more subtle, but still there and easy to read.
[5/11/20, 4:20:07 PM] Joe: Haha no link yet. It’s only on my computer for now.
[5/11/20, 4:25:27 PM] Lore: Hey you! my job is not just a room or a wall hahaha. It is not only the aesthetic, but also the functional, it is what I like about interior design. I want to learn web also now that I met you hahaha. but codes nothing!
[5/11/20, 4:26:01 PM] Lore: me gusta el diseño, las dos franjas negras, y los rectángulos de las fotos!
[5/11/20, 4:26:25 PM] Lore: lo hiciste vos el diseño también? cuanto tiempo llevas haciendo esta web? fue muy rápido, no?
[5/11/20, 4:26:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. I know it’s more than that and I hope you explain in more detail when you can. I want to hear more about it!
[5/11/20, 4:27:28 PM] Lore: jajaja todo bien.. bromeaba.. no me ofendí. No pasa nada!
[5/11/20, 4:27:54 PM] Joe: I was working on this for a month already before I started my dice game. I’ve been working slowly on this though cause no one I know needs it haha. Less motivation.
[5/11/20, 4:29:07 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure. You can still teach me the basics so I know more what it’s about
[5/11/20, 4:30:20 PM] Lore: menos motivación en la web? no la conoce mucha gente? parece linda la ropa
[5/11/20, 4:30:38 PM] Lore: mmmmmmmm
[5/11/20, 4:33:32 PM] Lore: el diseño de interiores tiene varias fases, te pueden contratar para hoteles, viviendas, espacios comerciales, etc... puede ser solo un proyecto de distribución, donde debes decidir la división de las estancias, tabiques, para aprovechar más luz, o que sean más útiles, etc ... eso se presenta con unos planos
[5/11/20, 4:36:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah these are all just “stock” images from the web I used to make the layout. It’s just a fake store for now.
[5/11/20, 4:37:17 PM] Joe: I did the design but it’s just super basic so it was easier. Just keep it to rectangular shapes and make the items in a grid. I just need to work on the buttons and the checkout process then it’s ready for real items.
[5/11/20, 4:38:49 PM] Joe: Ok ok. These are the 2D plans? Then later you can make a badass 3D model with lighting and all the good shit??
[5/11/20, 4:39:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh I can’t wait until you can make a whole tiny house in 3D. You can build your dream house and show it to me hahaha
[5/11/20, 4:39:34 PM] Joe: Then maybe I can build it 😂

[5/11/20, 4:40:52 PM] Lore: si, exacto jajaja..

[5/11/20, 4:53:06 PM] Lore: siiiii, cuando haga el curso de 3d, quiero probar a hacer la casa de mis sueños jajaja
[5/11/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Haha I would be just as bad at doing that layout as I am at web design 😂 

Looks like you know what you’re doing though haha
[5/11/20, 4:55:44 PM] Lore: I would like to have a large lot and a small house. A lot of grass to live with dogs ... I prefer something like that away from the city ... and not living in an apartment without a patio, locked..
‎[5/11/20, 4:56:00 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/11/20, 4:56:08 PM] Lore: y vos, cómo sería tu sueño de casa o donde?
[5/11/20, 4:56:50 PM] Lore: jajaja gracias, no sos malo.. lo único tenés que observar más y animarte a diseñar!
[5/11/20, 4:57:16 PM] Joe: You described what I want perfectly
[5/11/20, 4:57:49 PM] Lore: Sorry, I was shooting the video and I couldn't answer this!
[5/11/20, 4:58:52 PM] Lore: mmmmm a mi me gusta!!! esta limpio, ordenado, dan ganas de comprar.... jjjj
[5/11/20, 4:59:16 PM] Joe: I’m working on it. I’ve been paying attention to detail more in things like advertisements and other websites. Also subscribed to a bunch of web design YouTube channels recently haha
[5/11/20, 5:00:13 PM] Joe: Haha cool! Now I just need some real items. I guess I could always find something to sell and do it myself 😂
[5/11/20, 5:00:29 PM] Lore: genial!! yo miro estas páginas.. para inspirarme en las presentaciones
[5/11/20, 5:00:33 PM] Lore: https://www.behance.net/
[5/11/20, 5:00:52 PM] Lore: https://issuu.com/
[5/11/20, 5:01:14 PM] Joe: https://dribbble.com
[5/11/20, 5:01:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve been looking at this one lately
[5/11/20, 5:02:25 PM] Joe: The more resources the better. I drown myself in information and just pick up bits and pieces to learn haha
[5/11/20, 5:03:09 PM] Joe: What’s the second link?
[5/11/20, 5:03:34 PM] Joe: Oh never mind. Just had to read it duh haha
[5/11/20, 5:04:38 PM] Lore: jaja a mi también me pasa, asi que lo que hice, fue abrir un archivo nuevo de powerpoint... y copio las imágenes... de tipografías que me gustan, gamas de colores, distribución de fotos, asi que igual te parece útil, es como tener en un documento recopilación de varias fotos, o trozos que te gusten
[5/11/20, 5:05:32 PM] Lore: I didn't know this page, I keep it!
[5/11/20, 5:07:04 PM] Lore: Yes, I passed them to you because they can still be used for the designs you make
[5/11/20, 5:08:44 PM] Joe: That’s smart. I started by righting down color pallets i found online in my notebook hahaha. Like a caveman
[5/11/20, 5:09:15 PM] Joe: Haha cool glad I could give you some design resources you haven’t seen before.
[5/11/20, 5:09:31 PM] Lore: jajajaajajaja
‎[5/11/20, 5:09:58 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/11/20, 5:10:18 PM] Lore: Powerpoint es fácil, copia y pega!
[5/11/20, 5:11:04 PM] Joe: I don’t think I’ve ever used PowerPoint to be honest haha I’ll try it if it helps
[5/11/20, 5:12:00 PM] Lore: 😂 vosss!
[5/11/20, 5:13:06 PM] Lore: really? but it is super basic, how did you deliver the work or presentations in class? hahah
[5/11/20, 5:14:43 PM] Joe: 🤔 last time I had to do a presentation I used this thing called Prezi

I didn’t take classes for web development though. I just learned it online.
[5/11/20, 5:16:53 PM] Lore: jaja si Prezi. Pero Power Point, es como Paint, Excel, Word, programas que ya vienen en los ordenadores, son super faciles y útiles!
[5/11/20, 5:19:54 PM] Joe: Aaah ok ok. I’ll check it out. Add it to the workflow haha. Better than the notebook for sure 😂
[5/11/20, 5:20:09 PM] Joe: 😂 basically
‎[5/11/20, 5:22:36 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/11/20, 5:22:45 PM] Lore: jaja te mandé un video!
[5/11/20, 5:23:56 PM] Lore: que mala soy grabando con una mano jajajaja, mierda
[5/11/20, 5:24:38 PM] Joe: Damn super simple haha. Alright alright I’ll use it
[5/11/20, 5:26:04 PM] Joe: Lol it’s ok I can see it fine. I should’ve known about this a long time ago. I probably would’ve saved way more content that I’ve just forgotten about
[5/11/20, 5:28:08 PM] Lore: jaja claro, yo guardaba en carpetas, pero muchas veces las imagenes completas no me interesaban, solo una tipografía, entonces en powerpoint, recortó lo que me interesa, o la imagen completa, y cada día voy añadiendo nuevas diapositivas.. no tiene orden, solo copio y pego para luego poder revisarlo, no esta super ordenado...
[5/11/20, 5:29:28 PM] Lore: haha I think I'm getting bored talking about design, and various things about programs. I find it hard to stop. hahaha but I like to recommend things
[5/11/20, 5:30:10 PM] Joe: Sounds perfect to me. My notes are always a scattered mess hahah
[5/11/20, 5:30:39 PM] Lore: "I think I'm boring you talking about....bblabala" creo que antes hizo mala traducción
[5/11/20, 5:30:50 PM] Joe: You’re getting bored talking about it? Or not getting bored? Hahah
[5/11/20, 5:30:59 PM] Joe: Oh ok hahah no not at all
[5/11/20, 5:32:35 PM] Joe: Yeah it was a bad translation. I was worried for a second hahah. Thought I was boring you. But no, these are the things I’m interested in so you’re not boring me even a little
[5/11/20, 5:34:54 PM] Lore: jaja si me di cuenta rápido, por eso volví a ponerlo... me fio muchas veces d google, y luego tiene el significado contrario a lo que quiero decir!!! 😣
[5/11/20, 5:36:40 PM] Joe: no worries. I knew it was a bad translation because you said you, “find it hard to stop”. Wouldn’t be hard if it was boring hahah
[5/11/20, 5:38:21 PM] Joe: Do you always stay up so late? You’re a night owl haha. You even eat dinner pretty late.
[5/11/20, 5:39:17 PM] Lore: jaja la verdad es que no me acuesto demasiado tarde
[5/11/20, 5:39:59 PM] Lore: esto esta pasando solo en la cuarentena, siento que no soy productiva 100% durante el día, entonces intento como hacer más cosas y no me doy cuenta de la hora
[5/11/20, 5:40:35 PM] Lore: como al día siguiente no tengo que ir a trabajar, solo estoy en casa con el curso, tampoco me preocupa demasiado acostarme tarde
[5/11/20, 5:41:32 PM] Lore: ahora estaba mirando una página que me gusta mucho, me apunté a un curso de marketing digital, para instagram y son videos muy cortos.... aunque tengo que reconocer, que si me quedo muchas veces más tarde de lo normal, no es solo por la cuarentena, es por que hablo con vos
[5/11/20, 5:42:47 PM] Joe: Aaaah ok that makes sense. I stay up super late sometimes like I said before but I think more often I fall asleep early. At least compared to the schedule you’re on right now haha. I only get on the late night schedule when I have a project that I’m working on and need to get the ideas out before I forget 😂

[5/11/20, 5:47:13 PM] Lore: Haha I look silly, I know...thanks!
[5/11/20, 5:47:29 PM] Joe: Haha no you don’t!
[5/11/20, 5:48:42 PM] Joe: I enjoy our time talking. It’s hard with the time difference. Either you have to stay up late or I have to get up early. I appreciate you staying awake longer for me.
[5/11/20, 5:51:34 PM] Joe: If you think staying up late to talk to me makes you look silly....how are you going to look when you go halfway around the world to meet me? Hahahah
[5/11/20, 5:51:50 PM] Joe: Just kidding....don’t change your mind 😂 😂 😂
[5/11/20, 5:52:49 PM] Lore: 😮😮😮
[5/11/20, 5:53:53 PM] Lore: si, suuuuuuper tonta, tenés razón! jaja será mejor que busque algo más cercaa!
[5/11/20, 5:55:03 PM] Lore: aunque no estaba seguro el lugar de encuentro... jaja a lo mejor sos vos el que tenías que venir acá!
[5/11/20, 6:00:34 PM] Joe: If you can’t come to Hawaii I’ll gladly meet you anywhere in the world.

We can plan more details when you’re feeling ready haha. Maybe it’ll be easier to figure out as the world opens up more.
[5/11/20, 6:06:54 PM] Lore: haha yes, everything is super uncertain with this pandemic!
[5/11/20, 6:08:24 PM] Lore: the silly girl is going to sleep! haha enjoy the day!!  😘
[5/11/20, 6:08:57 PM] Joe: Ooook. Sleep well. Buenas noches 😘

[5/12/20, 12:02:56 PM] Joe: Pretty good. I feel super tired though. Making extra strong coffee right now.
[5/12/20, 12:04:22 PM] Joe: Cómo estuvo tu día?
[5/12/20, 12:07:14 PM] Lore: Did you go to bed too late? Haha
[5/12/20, 12:08:51 PM] Lore: mmm... poco productiva la mañana... Sandra sigue mal, entonces cuando nos ponemos con el curso... no esta centrada... 😕 y tengo que consolarla..
[5/12/20, 12:09:30 PM] Lore: mi intención hoy era hacer dos entregas, pero la puta planta no consiguió la nota mínima y tuve que arreglarla... jaja odio esa planta!
[5/12/20, 12:13:12 PM] Joe: Mm I guess I woke up for a while during the night. Maybe at around 4. I think I just stayed up a little too long when I woke up.
[5/12/20, 12:13:35 PM] Joe: That sucks. I hope things get better for her.
[5/12/20, 12:15:08 PM] Joe: Hahah that fucking plant! You’ll get it though!
[5/12/20, 12:20:33 PM] Joe: Here...this is my favorite radio station on the island if you want to try to find some new island music. Maybe it will help hahaha

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RfJXpxXOUeAwjTnONashG?nd=1
[5/12/20, 12:21:56 PM] Joe: That’s the actual radio station so you’ll probably hear commercials and all that too. But they play some good shit
[5/12/20, 12:27:17 PM] Lore: uhh muy pronto!! en que pensarías! jajaa
[5/12/20, 12:27:51 PM] Lore: Si, pobre.. es una chica super positiva siempre, pero esta vez esta jodida!
[5/12/20, 12:29:17 PM] Lore: jaja eso espero, no me motiva mucho la textura de la hoja, y sé que no esta del todo bien.. pero lo intento por si hay suerte y así dejo de hacerla jajaja
[5/12/20, 12:30:07 PM] Lore: Gracias, la acabo de guardar en mi spotify!!

[5/12/20, 12:37:15 PM] Lore: aunque es dificil lo que dice en español, es un acento muy cerrado del sur
[5/12/20, 12:38:11 PM] Joe: Yeah it sounded a little different for sure. What song is that? I think it might be one of the ones you send me

[5/12/20, 12:48:34 PM] Lore: jajajaja que gracia me hace, es que no sé ni como explicartelo
[5/12/20, 12:49:14 PM] Joe: Haha it’s a little hard but not too crazy. The more accents I hear the better, then I won’t be shocked when I come across it in real life
[5/12/20, 12:52:04 PM] Joe: I’ve been trying to learn the basics again haha. I found out that you can understand about 80% of spoken Spanish if you learn the 1000 most used words 

I think I can do that 👨‍🏫
[5/12/20, 12:52:51 PM] Lore: jajajajajajaja
[5/12/20, 12:53:36 PM] Lore: analysis, you can check out a book with that title hahah
[5/12/20, 12:54:18 PM] Lore: Joe!! vamos a practicar esta canción jaja
[5/12/20, 12:54:33 PM] Joe: Work smarter not harder hahaha I’m definitely going to get a book or some resource with the top 1000 words soon

[5/12/20, 1:13:32 PM] Lore: como?? jajaja
[5/12/20, 1:14:28 PM] Joe: Haha nothing never mind.
[5/12/20, 1:15:27 PM] Lore: me gustó mucho ese audio, jajaja espero no perderlo!!!
[5/12/20, 1:15:35 PM] Joe: But now I need to find out how many English words you need to learn to get a good understanding. Going to need it if you’re going to Hawaii 😂 

I wonder if it’s more, less, or the same amount of words 🤔
[5/12/20, 1:16:26 PM] Joe: Haha you can save it and use it to embarrass me later
[5/12/20, 1:16:38 PM] Lore: jajajaja averigualo, si son más de 1000, venis vos a España!
[5/12/20, 1:17:16 PM] Joe: If you say so 😂 😂 😂

[5/12/20, 1:20:05 PM] Joe: But I would be happy to come visit you in Spain so I’m not complaining there haha
[5/12/20, 1:21:25 PM] Joe: “
If you learn only 800 of the most frequently-used lemmas in English, you'll be able to understand 75% of the language as it is spoken in normal life.”
[5/12/20, 1:21:27 PM] Lore: Me dijiste que nos veríamos, tenés que sacarte el pasaporte y venir a Españaaaa! jajaja
[5/12/20, 1:22:24 PM] Joe: Oh we’re going to meet hahah whether I go there or you come here or we go wherever we want...it’ll happen. I promise.
[5/12/20, 1:23:43 PM] Lore: es más dificil para mi!!!! jaja tengo que aprender lemas, no palabras, además aprendo un 75 en vez de 80% 🐌

[5/12/20, 1:25:22 PM] Joe: Haha true true. 5% different is weird though. In spanish you get 80% understanding with 1000 words but only get an additional 5% for the next 1000. 

So 2000 words puts you at 85% understanding of spoken Spanish
[5/12/20, 1:26:04 PM] Lore: Jajaja dos gifs en respuesta a tu frase de vernos!
[5/12/20, 1:26:22 PM] Joe: And native speakers now between 10,000-20,000 words 🤯
[5/12/20, 1:27:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha perfect gifs. I’m really excited to make it happen so I’m glad you’re happy about it.
[5/12/20, 1:27:06 PM] Lore: Jajajaja tantas palabras sabemos? Mmm

[5/12/20, 1:29:38 PM] Joe: Aaaah this is going to be hard hahah. It took me about a month or two to memorize the top 200 drug brand names and their generic names when I was a pharmacy technician(like the assistant for the pharmacist)
[5/12/20, 1:30:04 PM] Joe: 😊 😊 😊
[5/12/20, 1:30:24 PM] Lore: uuuuuh, jajaja super dificil los nombres de farmacias, jaja yo siempre los pronuncio como 3 veces cuando voy a una farmacia
[5/12/20, 1:30:54 PM] Lore: I will take care that you learn many words! from right now !!!
[5/12/20, 1:32:03 PM] Lore: Migas ( crumbs)
[5/12/20, 1:32:10 PM] Joe: Yeah learning those was no fun. Now they’re taking up room in my brain cause I don’t need that shit anymore hahaha
[5/12/20, 1:32:20 PM] Lore: bigote ( moustache)

[5/12/20, 1:35:56 PM] Joe: Haha that’s like a breakfast one. I’ll use that 😂
[5/12/20, 1:36:27 PM] Lore: regalito ( es regalo, se dice "ito" es un diminutivo, se usa para decir como un regalo pequeño, pero también como cariñosamente)

Y me dejó un regalito junto a la candela
Cuando yo lo vi enseguida lo abrí
Y vi que era una planta de yerbagüena
[5/12/20, 1:37:49 PM] Lore: planta de yerbaguena, es una palabra un poco inventada, para referirse a la marihuana
[5/12/20, 1:38:23 PM] Lore: Pero yo no soy Pinocho que el corazón (heart) tiene de madera (wood)

[5/12/20, 1:40:47 PM] Lore: ME VOLVÍ LOCA JAJA ahora te las voy a decir para que las escuches como se pronuncian
[5/12/20, 1:42:10 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I’ll have time to study it while you sleep.

[5/12/20, 1:45:52 PM] Joe: Thank you professor 👩‍🏫 

I’ll work on those today!
[5/12/20, 1:48:47 PM] Joe: Oh and if you have more music in spanish for me to listen to, I’ll take that as well haha. 

I feel like just hearing words over and over again helps a lot even if I don’t understand the word yet
[5/12/20, 1:51:21 PM] Lore: Nada lindo!
[5/12/20, 1:52:38 PM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RH_Ol2tUCY
[5/12/20, 1:55:40 PM] Lore: acento uruguay y argentina, a ver si lo entendés! yo (suena como sho), zapatillas ( zapatishas), astillas (astishas),  la letra "LL" se pronuncia como "sh"
[5/12/20, 1:56:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha i noticed right away when  I heard “sho”(yo) at the beginning of the song.
[5/12/20, 1:57:21 PM] Joe: “Y yo de día”
[5/12/20, 1:57:32 PM] Lore: geeeeenio!!!

[5/12/20, 2:00:46 PM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAjASemgx3E
[5/12/20, 2:01:13 PM] Joe: I’m going to end up with a strange accent. Mix of all the places haha
[5/12/20, 2:01:56 PM] Lore: jajaa mira esta!!! Calle 13, es un grupo de música de Puerto Rico. El videoclip es una mierda, jaja pero su música esta bien, es como una mezcla. los ritmos...son muy famosos jajaja...
[5/12/20, 2:02:20 PM] Lore: No, vos tenés que tener mi acento! jajaja
[5/12/20, 2:02:26 PM] Joe: Muerte en Hawaii? What are you trying to say 😱 hahaha
[5/12/20, 2:02:37 PM] Lore: Si no, no te haré caso! jajaja
[5/12/20, 2:02:44 PM] Lore: JAJAJAJAJAA
[5/12/20, 2:05:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok. I’ll try my best to have an accent like yours. I think it sounds beautiful anyway so I’m fine with that 😂
[5/12/20, 2:07:50 PM] Lore: hahaha thanks, it is also the one that works best for you!!
[5/12/20, 2:09:12 PM] Lore: Also, Spanish speakers will listen to you fun and interesting and won't bother you too much...jijiii
[5/12/20, 2:15:33 PM] Joe: I don’t know why either but I wish I would’ve found out earlier. When I speak with your accent I sound a lot less like a super white boy trying to learn hahaha. I always hated the way my Spanish accent sounded. It’s so bad
[5/12/20, 2:16:17 PM] Joe: Good. I can be my boring self but they’ll at least find my accent interesting. +10 points
[5/12/20, 3:16:15 PM] Lore: pues mira, al final encontraste el acento que no te hace sentir así jajajaj. A mí me parece muy adorable/sexy cuando te escucho el acento "gringo/guiri" con el español con acento uru ☺️

[5/12/20, 3:30:53 PM] Lore: You're funny, I can't help not answer you
[5/12/20, 3:31:17 PM] Joe: Why do you say that? Are you trying to ignore me?
[5/12/20, 3:31:21 PM] Joe: I would be
[5/12/20, 3:32:57 PM] Lore: Mmmm jaja no exactamente
[5/12/20, 3:37:10 PM] Joe: Haha I mean...just let me know if you want me to disappear
‎[5/12/20, 3:37:41 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/12/20, 3:38:49 PM] Joe: Did you have your late night dinner yet? And go out on the street with your fake pass today?
[5/12/20, 3:40:59 PM] Lore: Mmm
[5/12/20, 3:43:43 PM] Joe: Mmm? What? No? Fine then I guess you’re stuck with me 🤷‍♂️
[5/12/20, 3:45:26 PM] Lore: Es que me pasa que no tengo muchas ganas de hablar con otros "amigos" , por que prefiero hablar con vos... Por eso digo que no puedo dejar de responderte ...
[5/12/20, 3:46:02 PM] Lore: Por tanto no quiero que dejes de hablarme!
[5/12/20, 3:48:02 PM] Lore: No sé jaja fue una frase que dije sin pensar demasiado y ahora tuve que pensar como explicarla jajaja
[5/12/20, 3:49:30 PM] Joe: Hahah don’t worry I’m just messing with you.
[5/12/20, 3:50:29 PM] Joe: I’m the same so I know exactly what you mean.
[5/12/20, 3:51:25 PM] Lore: Otros amigos= chicos
[5/12/20, 3:51:47 PM] Lore: Con mis amigas habló casi todos los días jajajaj
[5/12/20, 3:51:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha for sure
[5/12/20, 3:53:59 PM] Joe: Still....same, but with girls haha I was actually really content just being on my own for the time being and talking to girls usually leads to something I wasn’t trying to get into. At least not on purpose haha I’m still glad you messaged me
[5/12/20, 3:56:46 PM] Joe: Glad I can keep your attention from across the world better than the other boys though hahaha
[5/12/20, 3:58:15 PM] Lore: well I'm not soo happy, haha ​​I should be more interested in those who are "real"
[5/12/20, 3:58:43 PM] Lore: well yes happy to meet you and spend time together talking haha
[5/12/20, 3:58:53 PM] Joe: Are you calling me pinocho? Cause I’m a real boy hahaha
[5/12/20, 3:58:59 PM] Lore: Fuck jajaj
[5/12/20, 3:59:26 PM] Joe: 😂 I got no strings. Promise. I’m a real boy hahah
[5/12/20, 3:59:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja real me refiero a...
[5/12/20, 4:01:33 PM] Lore: Poder verte la cara, darte un beso, un abrazo, sexo, dormir, jaja básicos de la vida real
[5/12/20, 4:02:02 PM] Joe: Haha I know what you meant. I wish I was closer to you now, but I’m telling you I’ll make it happen. I’ll be real for you soon enough
[5/12/20, 4:02:44 PM] Lore: Jajaja no te asustes con esto
[5/12/20, 4:04:12 PM] Joe: Not at all haha that’s real life. I wish it was real for us. Very sooooooooon!!
[5/12/20, 4:06:17 PM] Joe: Knowing someone cares about you is always great but there’s something about feeling their touch. I know people crave that feeling of being together so it’s not weird at all.
‎[5/12/20, 4:08:51 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/12/20, 4:09:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’s me?
[5/12/20, 4:09:59 PM] Lore: No sé quién de los dos exactamente
[5/12/20, 4:10:08 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/12/20, 4:10:20 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/12/20, 4:11:15 PM] Joe: I guess you seem to be opening up a little more too. I appreciate the honesty.
[5/12/20, 4:13:24 PM] Lore: Jajajaa con mi pensamiento de que no puedo ver al chico que me interesa cuando acabe la cuarentena

[5/12/20, 4:15:49 PM] Joe: Do you not believe me?
[5/12/20, 4:16:27 PM] Joe: Or will you change your mind? You only like me because you CAN’T see me even if you want to ?hahaha
[5/12/20, 4:20:15 PM] Joe: Alright alright. Let me ask you.....what are your honest expectations? And what would be ideal?(what would make you happiest?)
‎[5/12/20, 4:21:00 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/12/20, 4:21:26 PM] Lore: jajaja perdón, mmm no sé!
[5/12/20, 4:22:13 PM] Joe: Haha it’s ok. Think about it. It’s your life. Take some time before you tell me if you need to
[5/12/20, 4:23:48 PM] Lore: simplemente me vinieron esos pensamientos a la cabeza, que me gustaría pasar un buen rato ahora mismo o cuando acabe la cuarentena con una persona que no conozco realmente, solo a través de mensajes, que esta a muchísimos km, pero que a pesar de eso, me sigue interesando jaja
[5/12/20, 4:25:04 PM] Lore: Si, te creo! por que sé que esto me lo dijiste después de semanas de estar hablando, no fue el primer día!!
[5/12/20, 4:26:16 PM] Lore: pero claro, estamos ahora mismo en una pandemia, en España tenemos que pasar fases, y las fronteras estarán cerradas hasta principios de 2021
[5/12/20, 4:27:09 PM] Lore: y la paciencia, no es mi fuerte, jaja yo quiero verte ya, ahora mismo, 13/05 a las 1:27 hs jajajaja
[5/12/20, 4:28:58 PM] Joe: Well....you don’t have to put your life on pause for me. You’re a grown up and you have a life outside of talking to a stranger on the internet. Do whatever makes you happy. Just stay in touch and we’ll see what happens.
[5/12/20, 4:31:01 PM] Lore: mmmm obviamente Joe, solo te solté pensamientos que tuve nada más!
[5/12/20, 4:31:11 PM] Lore: tampoco me lo digas así, tan serio.. jaja
[5/12/20, 4:32:34 PM] Joe: Hahaha a grownup? Ok never again 😂
[5/12/20, 4:32:51 PM] Joe: Stranger on the internet? Which one?
[5/12/20, 4:33:15 PM] Lore: Toda la oración completa
[5/12/20, 4:33:17 PM] Lore: jaja
[5/12/20, 4:33:50 PM] Lore: haha well sorry, I shouldn't have said anything, I'm a little impulsive 🤐🤐
[5/12/20, 4:36:51 PM] Joe: Hahah alright. Ugh. This already would’ve been complicated without the pandemic. I don’t know. I’m pretty patient but I know you said you’re not 😂
[5/12/20, 4:41:33 PM] Joe: I have to do some research on these rules. This is bullshit hahah. I’m going to make this happen
[5/12/20, 4:42:41 PM] Lore: haha no proooblem, we'll see you when we can! 🌎
‎[5/12/20, 4:47:26 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted

[5/12/20, 4:54:56 PM] Lore: jajajajaa

[5/13/20, 12:33:20 PM] Lore: fuck you.. puede ser como una manera de decir a alguien, negativa o cariñoso.. en España sería .... " vete a la mierda"  "vete a tomar por culo"  en uruguay sería " anda a cagar" " andate a la mierda" "andate a la concha de tu madre"
[5/13/20, 12:33:38 PM] Lore: jajaja dios, que mal hablados que somos en uruguay, jajaja
[5/13/20, 12:35:00 PM] Lore: sería como "jodete...pero no mucha gente dice esa palabra, se dicen mas las otras que te dije arriba... para fuck you
[5/13/20, 12:35:13 PM] Lore: jajajaj y esta.... sería...
[5/13/20, 12:35:41 PM] Lore: En España : follar en Uruguay : Cojer
[5/13/20, 12:35:51 PM] Lore: aplicado en una frase.. sería!
[5/13/20, 12:36:08 PM] Lore: (mierda, no voy a imaginarlo meintras lo digo, lo promero jaja)

[5/13/20, 12:37:16 PM] Lore: *prometo

[5/13/20, 12:49:32 PM] Lore: VOZ
[5/13/20, 12:51:05 PM] Joe: Haha dammit. Ok how would you say it? And what did I say exactly? Is it like “do you want to fuck me”
[5/13/20, 12:52:26 PM] Lore: Querés cojerme? sounds like "do you want me to buy cakes for you?)
[5/13/20, 12:52:50 PM] Joe: Hahahaha buy cakes???

[5/13/20, 12:54:45 PM] Lore: haha if it's a way of saying, as sweet for the meaning of the word, it doesn't sound convincing if the decision to someone like that if he wants to " cojer con vos" hahaha
[5/13/20, 12:55:56 PM] Joe: Haha ok ok makes sense. So what if i actually want someone to buy me cake? 😂
[5/13/20, 12:56:28 PM] Joe: Don’t want to ask you for a cake for my birthday and you get the wrong idea.
[5/13/20, 12:57:02 PM] Joe: Don’t want the opposite either hahah

[5/13/20, 4:06:34 PM] Lore: Es que vos lo pronuncias perfecto jajaj
[5/13/20, 4:07:55 PM] Lore: No?? Sería como una "indirecta", no se usa?
[5/13/20, 4:08:06 PM] Lore: 🤔
[5/13/20, 4:08:44 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry, english is ugly. Español es muy bonita
[5/13/20, 4:09:02 PM] Joe: Hah it’s used. But you would be unlucky talking to me hahahah
[5/13/20, 4:09:33 PM] Lore: Ahhhhhh
[5/13/20, 4:09:48 PM] Lore: Jajaj
[5/13/20, 4:10:50 PM] Lore: No lo creo
[5/13/20, 4:11:28 PM] Joe: Sorry bad joke haha. But my pronunciation is only good because I’ve heard Spanish all my life. A lot of people speak Spanish in California and a lot of my family does. I just never learned enough to converse fluently.
[5/13/20, 4:12:32 PM] Lore: Jaja no, fue buena. Pero pensé que no me entendías "la indirecta"
[5/13/20, 4:13:09 PM] Lore: Ah sí, tramposoo, yo pasó más vergüenza que vos pronunciado, digo oso en vez de cerveza jajaj
[5/13/20, 4:13:26 PM] Lore: Vos sabés español y no me lo querés decir para que te enseñe jajaja
[5/13/20, 4:14:19 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[5/13/20, 4:15:28 PM] Joe: I wish I knew spanish. It’d make things a lot easier 😂
[5/13/20, 4:17:55 PM] Joe: But I’ve gotten way better in a few weeks. Listening to hella Spanish music and watched all 4 seasons of la casa haha
[5/13/20, 4:19:17 PM] Joe: And i make sure to read all your messages in Spanish before I translate them and try to figure out what it says beforehand. Definitely need the translator less often. I used it for literally every message at the beginning 🤷‍♂️

[5/13/20, 4:35:21 PM] Lore: Nueva actitud jaja! Nunca imaginé que después de ese mensaje, intentarías hablar español

[5/13/20, 4:42:54 PM] Joe: Haha I just needed some time to realize my mistake 😂
[5/13/20, 4:46:03 PM] Lore: Jjjjj bueno, aprenderás español y podrás hablar con toda tu familia!
[5/13/20, 4:46:05 PM] Joe: That baseball gif has me laughing too much. That’s totally me. All my life hahah
[5/13/20, 4:46:42 PM] Lore: Jajajaja 🙈🙈🙈
[5/13/20, 4:47:50 PM] Joe: I’m going to go to Peru if I learn!!Hella family in Peru haha
[5/13/20, 4:48:07 PM] Lore: Si, cuando te conocí un poco más me di cuenta que eras tímido jjjj .. aunque cada vez menos
[5/13/20, 4:48:26 PM] Lore: Llévame!!! Jaja hay lindas playas en Perú
[5/13/20, 4:50:05 PM] Joe: Yeah it sounds really cool. I wish I could’ve seen it when my grandparents were little though. My grandma said she had a penguin as pet! I was jealous when I heard that haha.
[5/13/20, 4:52:45 PM] Joe: I already made up my mind, and even if we don’t end up doing something together I’m leaving California after the summer again so it’s just a matter of where I want to go at this point. Hopefully I’m ready to go to the spanish speaking countries but even if I’m not, what’s a better way to learn than going where everyone speaks Spanish?
[5/13/20, 4:54:03 PM] Joe: I don’t know, I just want to do something exciting I guess. And I’m tired of California haha
[5/13/20, 4:55:56 PM] Joe: Of course I would prefer to end up in the same country as you though. That would be great
[5/13/20, 4:55:56 PM] Lore: Que capa! / Que jefa! Tu abuela con un pingüino de mascota.
[5/13/20, 4:56:55 PM] Joe: The chicks in la casa remind me of my grandma when they do badass shit. She’s a badass lady haha
[5/13/20, 4:57:56 PM] Lore: Mmmm manera de aprender español sin viajar a un país de habla hispana? 

Sería o una academia, o cómo estás haciendo ahora de manera autodidacta. App, películas, series, conversación con nativo, etc
[5/13/20, 4:59:24 PM] Lore: Ah.. cual es el mejor lugar para aprender español?
[5/13/20, 5:01:11 PM] Joe: Hahah I guess it was kind rhetorical(?) like....it is probably the best way to learn. People learn the fastest when they go to a country that speaks the language they’re trying to learn
[5/13/20, 5:02:10 PM] Lore: Ah qué boluda
[5/13/20, 5:02:33 PM] Lore: Jaja perdona, pensé que me lo estabas preguntando
[5/13/20, 5:03:51 PM] Lore: Me parece buena idea que viajes, además aprendiendo un idioma, conociendo nuevos lugares

[5/13/20, 5:04:20 PM] Joe: Haha no worries. By the way, I just got approved to follow that Instagram page that you tried to share with me from. 

So when you see good memes from them, send them to meeee
[5/13/20, 5:05:19 PM] Joe: Getting to where you are is the goal 😂
[5/13/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: And understanding you without you having to speak in slow motion hahaha
[5/13/20, 5:06:13 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/13/20, 5:06:33 PM] Lore: Hablaré lento siempre que lo necesites ☺️
[5/13/20, 5:08:49 PM] Lore: Sii te mandaré memes, veo todo el rato durante esta puta cuarentena jajaja y muchos vídeos de animales
[5/13/20, 5:08:53 PM] Joe: Haha gracias! It’s been really fun getting to know you even with all this language barrier bullshit. Getting that out of the way would be great
[5/13/20, 5:09:19 PM] Joe: But that’s why I’m learning haha
[5/13/20, 5:10:10 PM] Joe: Ah bien. no puedo esperar para juzgar sus memes 👨‍⚖️
[5/13/20, 5:10:45 PM] Lore: Si, es divertido. Yo creo que nunca había dedicado tanto tiempo a inglés jaja
[5/13/20, 5:11:56 PM] Lore: No sé cómo los dos mantenemos la atención para tener conversaciones.. sin ninguno saber el idioma de otro jaja es algo muy curioso

[5/13/20, 5:14:42 PM] Joe: Igualmente? Mismo? No se

‎[5/13/20, 5:15:44 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/13/20, 5:16:09 PM] Joe: I always end up agreeing with you or feel similar when you describe something haha.
[5/13/20, 5:16:28 PM] Lore: Y si es en negativo... Sería " no pienso lo mismo" " no estoy de acuerdo"
[5/13/20, 5:16:56 PM] Joe: Perfecto. Gracias
[5/13/20, 5:17:37 PM] Joe: 😂 😂
[5/13/20, 5:17:39 PM] Lore: Jaja gracias, "yo también" me too ( esta es otra opción)

[5/13/20, 5:25:52 PM] Lore: * en España los aguacates son caros, y en el video muestra un poco la mala suerte ciando uno se te pone malo

[5/13/20, 11:15:27 PM] Lore: Esto lo ponen en las discotecas jaja, a mí el estilo de música no me gusta. Pero al final suena tanto en la radio, que.... "Se te pega la canción" jajaja
[5/13/20, 11:15:35 PM] Joe: It didn’t even click in my mind Hahahaha
[5/13/20, 11:15:57 PM] Joe: jajaja https://youtu.be/dr_GAJZviR0

[5/14/20, 12:21:41 PM] Lore: pero en un mes... se puede salir en avión, acá tenemos cerradas las fronteras y la gente que tenía vuelo pagado, tuvo la opción de cambiar de fecha, o la opción de elegir viajar cuando se levante el estado de alarma

[5/14/20, 12:46:00 PM] Joe: Way more realistic than I imagined the final result would look like. Not because of your skill or anything but because I didn’t know the program could make things look like that
[5/14/20, 12:47:49 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha “la puta planta, con su puta maceta” 😂 😂 

You really didn’t like making that one haha
[5/14/20, 12:48:25 PM] Joe: I would use this chair! Haha very nice work
[5/14/20, 12:55:10 PM] Lore: Ohhhh muchas gracias Joe!!!

[5/14/20, 1:01:46 PM] Joe: I want to know more about how it’s done. Seems complicated. Do you make make all the shapes with a bunch of little rectangles, squares, and triangles? Cause that shit seems like it would take forever
[5/14/20, 1:02:06 PM] Lore: Argentine girls, in a super pretty and hippie town in Uruguay, called Cabo Polonio. the song is slow, you can still understand some words and a clear accent as always haha
[5/14/20, 1:04:44 PM] Lore: jajaja para modelar se puede partir de una linea, caja, circulo..... luego se edita toda su geometría ( vertices, aristas, poligonos), se agregan modificadores, que hacen ciertas funciones a los objetos, como curvar una esquina, arrugar algun elemento, y luego dentro de esos modificadores, hay parametros de ajuste, como más formas, medidas, etc
[5/14/20, 1:11:25 PM] Joe: Aaah good. Some slow music so I can hear the words better hahah. 

I’m totally going to end up with that “sh” sound in my accent. All this Argentinian and Uruguayan content is programming my brain hahah


“se rie y yo lloro” sounds like “sho shorro”

[5/14/20, 1:23:54 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry about it. The more content the better for learning to be honest.

[5/15/20, 11:13:27 AM] Joe: Hahaha you did very well. I was taken back for a second when I read “fuck you joe” 😆 didn’t see that coming
[5/15/20, 11:15:28 AM] Lore: jajaja
[5/15/20, 11:22:26 AM] Lore: Today the government was telling us if we went from phase, right now Madrid is in phase 0. And if we went to phase 1, everything was already organized so that the shops under 400 m2 reopen, and phase 2, greater than 800 m2 . ...
and to be able to be accompanied again with people who don´t live with you, such as friends, family, small groups...
[5/15/20, 11:23:06 AM] Lore: but none of this will happen, we are still in fucking phase 0....😭
[5/15/20, 11:25:12 AM] Joe: Damn... this is fucked. When the lockdown first happened in the US all they were saying was that we need to “flatten the curve” so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. They made it seem like if we just brought the number of cases down to a number the hospitals could handle it would be fine.
[5/15/20, 11:27:19 AM] Joe: But now they’re making it seem like we’re locked down until it is gone completely or there is a vaccine or something. They keep moving the goalpost, which is annoying. 

I just want to know what the data needs to look like before things go back to normal. They can’t keep changing the rules hahaha
[5/15/20, 11:28:58 AM] Joe: Also the US is weird because the federal government might end the lockdown but individual states or cities can impose their own lockdowns so everything will open at different times across the country. 


Haha sorry that was a lot 😂
[5/15/20, 11:32:16 AM] Lore: Is there someone who is very interested in the subject? haha ok, I like to read!
[5/15/20, 11:36:23 AM] Lore: Yes, they did the same in Spain ... although first they scared us with the number of dead and infected doctors, then they had to change their minds, because people were paranoid and aggressive..
[5/15/20, 11:37:01 AM] Joe: What do you mean, “is there someone who is very interested”? Like, do I have a resource for you to read about it? Or are you saying that I’m interested in it because of how much I explained? Haha sorry 😐
[5/15/20, 11:37:24 AM] Lore: I try to be shut up in a quiet house, but I hate politicians and the media more and more every day.....burned them all!
[5/15/20, 11:37:31 AM] Joe: The way the stories change isn’t very confidence inspiring haha
[5/15/20, 11:38:45 AM] Joe: Same hahaha. I’m considered an “independent” in the US. Republicans and democrats both get mad at me cause I talk shit about both sides hahah. Liberals accuse me of being conservative and conservatives accuse me of being liberal but really I’m in the middle and think they’re all idiots hahaha
[5/15/20, 11:39:59 AM] Lore: jaja es como una pregunta retorica, cuando alguien muestra interés por algo...era una manera de decirlo..  jjjj como que estas interesado en el tema, y me di cuenta por las respuestas jaja
[5/15/20, 11:40:32 AM] Joe: And the media is the fucking worst. Very biased and it’s super noticeable.
[5/15/20, 11:42:02 AM] Joe: Aaaah ok. If you say it in English take of the “is”. It will sound/read more sarcastic or more like a joke. I don’t know why, but adding “is” makes it sound like a real question haha
[5/15/20, 11:42:31 AM] Joe: Take off* the “if”
[5/15/20, 11:42:36 AM] Joe: Fuck
[5/15/20, 11:42:40 AM] Joe: “Is”*
[5/15/20, 11:42:41 AM] Joe: Haha
[5/15/20, 11:43:03 AM] Lore: jjj independiente, eso esta bien, pero espero que no tengas demasiados pensamientos conservadores jaja
[5/15/20, 11:44:21 AM] Joe: If you say, “someone is interested in the topic??” It would be great. Add “mmm” at the beginning or “eh” at the end and you’re a native speaker haha
[5/15/20, 11:44:37 AM] Lore: totalmente!! es que repiten siempre lo mismo, hablan desde la puta ignorancia muchas veces, acá pones un programa de tv, con 4 personas que opinan, critican, juzgan... pero eso hace que el espectador que lo vea, sea manipulado con esa informacion
[5/15/20, 11:46:01 AM] Joe: Haha no not too many. I don’t agree with conservatives or liberals on much so I just talk shot about everyone. I used to be a Democrat which would be liberal but they went fucking insane in the last few years so now I’m stuck in the middle
[5/15/20, 11:46:46 AM] Lore: jaja okey... mmm.... someone is interested in the topic? 🤓🙄
[5/15/20, 11:47:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeaaaaahhhh
[5/15/20, 11:47:12 AM] Joe: Perfecto
[5/15/20, 11:47:57 AM] Lore: que pensamientos de conservador tenés Josephhhh?
[5/15/20, 11:48:00 AM] Joe: It’s been a long time since I watched the mainstream media. I get news from the internet hahah.
[5/15/20, 11:50:41 AM] Joe: 🤔 I think having a strong family is important. That’s considered a conservative value here. 

Other than that I’m not sure
[5/15/20, 11:51:31 AM] Lore: jaja sii totalmente!
[5/15/20, 11:51:59 AM] Lore: mmm stong family, what do you mean?
[5/15/20, 11:53:14 AM] Lore: By the way, I never asked you, are you religious?
[5/15/20, 11:53:30 AM] Joe: I like to save money and I invest a lot of it. Not sure if that’s considered conservative haha
[5/15/20, 11:54:54 AM] Joe: Strong family like you believe in family bond, maybe marriage, although to answer your other question, I’m not really religious. I believe there is something special spiritually about the universe and the world but I don’t believe in organized religion.
‎[5/15/20, 11:55:41 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/15/20, 11:55:44 AM] Joe: I’m not sure I even know what conservative values I have, if any, just that i disagree with the liberals often in this country.
[5/15/20, 11:56:14 AM] Joe: I disagree with conservatives a lot too. I disagree with everything and everyone 😂
[5/15/20, 11:58:13 AM] Joe: Everyone speaks in platitudes with no real solutions. They say things that sound nice and I hate it. 


People all remind me of when I was in elementary school and we did a mock election....some of the kids “running” for president would say “I’ll put a candy machine in the hallway!” and they would win cause all the kids would believe the nice sounding bullshit hahaha
[5/15/20, 11:59:53 AM] Lore: jajaja y vos que proponias con esa edad?
[5/15/20, 12:00:10 PM] Joe: Haha I have too many thoughts on the subject of politics and media. Should not have got me started 😂
[5/15/20, 12:01:37 PM] Lore: jajaja yo creo que si...  mmm
[5/15/20, 12:02:27 PM] Lore: con que cosas de los liberales ahi no estas de acuerdo?
[5/15/20, 12:06:05 PM] Joe: Are you asking if I have any ideas? Well first thing that needs to happen in the US is an end to the massive divide we have right now. If one side has an idea, even if it’s good, the other side opposes it for political posturing. Literally nothing good gets done because we’re split in half. 

But after that if we’re all on one side we can look at the data objectively and use that to make decisions. Right now it looks like decisions are made for political purposes or based on feelings. Facts need to be the most important thing when considering anything. 

Then since the money printers are going “brrrrrr” printing trillions of dollars...I would give that to the people in the form of universal basic income. It would be a trickle up stimulus package instead of the trickle down stuff we’re getting. We have massive unemployment and food banks are running out of food so I would put a lot of focus there


I could go on for days about this hahahah so I’ll stop there
[5/15/20, 12:14:48 PM] Joe: 🤔 most recently the super liberal people here supported Bernie Sanders. I did too in 2016 because he wanted healthcare for everyone. But looking at his policies this time around, he had things like a federal jobs guarantee, which sounds wonderful. Making sure everyone who is capable of working has a job...but there are too many problems with it that no one ever dealt with....who is in charge? How much does everyone get paid? What if you don’t like the federal job you’ve been guaranteed? What happens when a president like Trump is in charge of the federal jobs guarantee and makes his workforce “build the wall”? What about the people that are not capable of working?



I’d say I’m way more liberal than conservative....it’s mostly that I don’t agree with the policy choices of the liberal politicians that I consider myself in the middle. 

The so called liberals here want to give too much power to the government and the conservatives want the government to basically do nothing but help rich people.


Okey sorry sorry. Please tell me a little about where you fall on the spectrum hahaha. What are you like?
[5/15/20, 12:16:50 PM] Lore: eyeyey perdón, que fui justo al baño y me crucé con sandra que me estaba contando unas cosas
[5/15/20, 12:17:25 PM] Lore: voy a leer todo lo que me pones, 1 seg jaja
‎[5/15/20, 12:17:33 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/15/20, 12:18:57 PM] Lore: 😍 un gif de mono, mi animal favorito con los perros. ( jajaj vuelvo al texto)
[5/15/20, 12:24:25 PM] Lore: Yo creo que esto pasa en todos lados en diferente medida, en la política en si.. siempre hay separaciones, y luchas... lamentablemente se pierden buenas iniciativas para la población, por intereses económicos, sociales, religiosos, etc...
[5/15/20, 12:27:27 PM] Joe: The normal people come last. Basically I aligned very well with this politician named Andrew Yang this year. He was like my dream candidate hahaha. Very focused on working based of hard numbers/data and had actual solution oriented policies that would help average people. He wrote a book called The War on Normal People. Excellent book 📚
[5/15/20, 12:29:08 PM] Lore: Si, parece que hay decisiones buenas para la gente, básicas como la salud y trabajo, y resulta que luego son un puto engaño... y al final parece que somos todos tontos, lo bueno es que ahí en cierto modo, por lo que comentas los estados pueden tomar sus propias decisiones ( no?)
[5/15/20, 12:30:11 PM] Lore: Ay, me gustaría leerlo! investigaré sobre el!
‎[5/15/20, 12:33:04 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/15/20, 12:33:18 PM] Joe: That’s my duuuuuude! Hahaha
[5/15/20, 12:36:14 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/15/20, 12:36:20 PM] Lore: 1.000 dolis! que rico
[5/15/20, 12:36:26 PM] Joe: It’s weird. The states can do their own rules to make things stricter but not more relaxed than the federal government. Technically with marijuana laws a lot of states are breaking federal law but the federal government has mostly stopped enforcement on stores running legally in states.
[5/15/20, 12:37:11 PM] Joe: Haha it’ll make more sense after the book
[5/15/20, 12:37:25 PM] Lore: Me da seguridad este hombre, yo sou consumista de Amazon ( por la facilidad), pero dejaría de hacerlo jaja
[5/15/20, 12:38:52 PM] Joe: I thought his ideas were kind of crazy at first but I researched them quite a bit and they would theoretically work well and give a lot of power to regular people
‎[5/15/20, 12:42:44 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/15/20, 12:43:34 PM] Lore: eso suena genial de poder a las personas comunes!
[5/15/20, 12:44:06 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 I’m fucking dead 💀
[5/15/20, 12:44:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[5/15/20, 12:44:15 PM] Joe: Fuck
[5/15/20, 12:47:29 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be great. But if you read the book and learn about automation coming it looks like one of the only smart things to do. 


Amazon is starting to open stores that you walk in with your phone to check in, like getting on a subway with a pass that’s on your phone. Then you walk around and pick up what you want and leave. No cashiers. That’s one of the most common jobs here. Google is making a artificial intelligence telemarketer, that’s another common job. Basically automation will come over next 5-25 years and slowly take the most common jobs.
[5/15/20, 12:47:47 PM] Lore: estoy leyendo un poco quién era antes
[5/15/20, 12:49:31 PM] Lore: te iba a poner lo que estoy leyendo en español, en los artículos, pero por momentos me olvido de la barrera del idioma jaja
[5/15/20, 12:50:19 PM] Lore: totalmente de acuerdo, me siento culpable
[5/15/20, 12:52:30 PM] Lore: soy consciente de que hay puestos de trabajo que se eliminan, y que es una mierda, pero también la sociedad en la que vivimos, va a un ritmo muy rápido, y tenés que ajustarte a ella... yo no tengo tiempo o ganas incluso muchas veces, de recorrerme la ciudad para comprar un libro en un sitio, una cafetera en otro, etc.. es algo muy cómodo... y además podés ver opiniones del resto, es como que se crea una comunidad..
[5/15/20, 12:52:55 PM] Joe: It’s fine. The technology is there. Whether it’s Amazon or someone else it’s inevitable and should actually be desirable. But we need to make sure people have money even if they have no work. Then we can automate and be very happy about it.
[5/15/20, 12:53:57 PM] Lore: I agree!
[5/15/20, 12:54:02 PM] Joe: If people are scared of automation and job losses because they’ll have no money it will only slow us down as a society
[5/15/20, 12:55:09 PM] Joe: Haha cool. I don’t want to sound like a crazy person 😂 

 But I love technology so I see how close it is and he had very good solutions before it becomes a problem
[5/15/20, 12:55:54 PM] Lore: Okey, y basicamente cual sería la mejor opcion, que dice Andrew Yang de esto?
[5/15/20, 12:59:45 PM] Lore: me refiero, como se pueden conservar todos esos puestos de trabajo, a pesar del ritmo que llevamos en la sociedad
[5/15/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Universal basic income. Income not tied to what you do for a living. It’s like this....in the US there is a disagreement about minimum wage. Some think it should go up, others say it would kill small businesses because only big businesses can afford that. I understand both sides. People need more money, small businesses can’t afford it. Universal basic income.
[5/15/20, 1:00:20 PM] Lore: al final, siempre vamos a buscar lo más rápido, cómodo, barato...
[5/15/20, 1:01:06 PM] Joe: You don’t. He would say, “we need to decouple human value from economic value and put the money directly in the people’s hands”
[5/15/20, 1:02:05 PM] Joe: Exactly. We should. I want that. I want the future where humans can do less tedious task and have more time for living. But they’ll need money to live
[5/15/20, 1:06:15 PM] Joe: And there will still be jobs and ways to move up the ladder in life but everyone will have at least a baseline of income to live from. 


He also gives many examples of people that aren’t valued economically today but do a lot of work we need. Stay at home parents, people that take care of loved ones, a lot of artist hahaha. Universal basic income gives those people something for contributing to society even if there is no way to make money from it. 

I don’t know. Seems like bullshit but amazon is close to eliminating retail, google is close to eliminating receptionist and telemarketers, telsa will get rid of the need for driving jobs. All relatively soon.
‎[5/15/20, 1:09:00 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/15/20, 1:09:03 PM] Joe: Alright I’ve said waaaaay too much hahahahaha

[5/15/20, 1:09:28 PM] Joe: Make America Think Harder 😂 MATH
[5/15/20, 1:09:34 PM] Lore: estaba leyendo y reflexionando sobre todo lo que decís!
[5/15/20, 1:09:39 PM] Joe: Told you that’s my dude
[5/15/20, 1:10:03 PM] Lore: tenés razón, todo tiene su lógica y creo que seguramente nos iría mejor todo!
[5/15/20, 1:10:30 PM] Lore: hay que encontar una manera en que la teconologia no destruya todos estos puestos de trabajo
[5/15/20, 1:11:09 PM] Lore: y obviamente, una renta basica para todas las personas!
[5/15/20, 1:11:19 PM] Joe: No. We should destroy all jobs. Humans will create new better ones.
[5/15/20, 1:11:30 PM] Joe: Well. That’s my opinion hahaha
[5/15/20, 1:12:19 PM] Joe: But we should provide for everyone at the same time. You can’t create the next amazing thing if you work just to survive and barely even make it
[5/15/20, 1:12:32 PM] Lore: que nuevos trabajos mejores crees que puede crear la gente?
[5/15/20, 1:13:14 PM] Lore: no te dejo en paz! jajaja te tengo atrapado intentando imaginar un mundo mejor!
[5/15/20, 1:13:41 PM] Lore: I won't leave you alone! hahaha I got you caught trying to imagine a better world!🙈
[5/15/20, 1:15:12 PM] Joe: Hahaa this comes from the minds of the humans with more time to think. There will always be problems to solve and ways to make life better. Also, if there was a universal basic income, people can be secure in doing what they love. Even if it makes less money than you could survive on without the basic income.
[5/15/20, 1:15:13 PM] Lore: yo no tenía ni idea de el significado de tu gorra, jaja desde el primer día que te ví ahi estabas, defensor de Yang jajaa
[5/15/20, 1:15:42 PM] Lore: 💙
[5/15/20, 1:15:47 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
[5/15/20, 1:16:48 PM] Joe: Haha I got very passionate about these ideas and studied them a lot. I spent a lot of time thinking about this 😂

[5/15/20, 1:25:41 PM] Joe: Oh shit before I get distracted sending pictures I was going to ask how you would describe yourself
[5/15/20, 1:26:03 PM] Lore: me gusta su forma...!!! de que color la pintamos? jajaja
[5/15/20, 1:26:34 PM] Lore: jaja en cuanto a ideales te referís?
[5/15/20, 1:26:51 PM] Joe: Still comes up “to marry” soooo 🤷‍♂️ 


But alright if you insist 😂
[5/15/20, 1:27:51 PM] Joe: Seems like you like the blue and white houses so we’ll go with that haha
[5/15/20, 1:28:54 PM] Lore: jajaja mi color preferido es el verde, verde turquesa.. pero esas azules me encantaría azul y blanca también jaja
[5/15/20, 1:28:58 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I suppose
[5/15/20, 1:29:54 PM] Joe: Hahahahah damn stealing my color preferences and shit
[5/15/20, 1:30:08 PM] Joe: 🙄
[5/15/20, 1:31:26 PM] Lore: mmm... no me guío tanto por los politicos, normalmente son todos unos mentirosos y me cuesta creerles, incluso si alguno tiene razón en algo, siempre es un titere por los intereses que hay detrás. Solo me identifico con uno de ellos, un ex presidente uruguayo, "Pepe Mujica", tengo admiración por ese hombre y su filosofía
[5/15/20, 1:32:11 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll learn about him while you learn about Andrew Yang
[5/15/20, 1:32:55 PM] Lore: en realidad lo que yo pienso, y me gustaría para mi futuro, y de las siguientes generaciones, es que no se pierda nunca la importancia de la sanidad, una buena asistencia médica para todo el mundo, sin restricciones
[5/15/20, 1:35:06 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s a necessary thing. Seems obvious especially now.
[5/15/20, 1:35:20 PM] Lore: la educación también me parece clave, me gusta mucho los sistemas educativos, que utilizan diferentes países nórdicos, como Finlandia principalmente... ser más prácticos, no tan cuadriculados, poder valorar que existen diferentes tipos de inteligencias, que se valore más todo el tema cultural, en cuanto a artes, música, etc
[5/15/20, 1:35:51 PM] Joe: Ok ok I like that
[5/15/20, 1:37:15 PM] Lore: y al final la educación es importante también, para los futuros puestos de trabajo... todos son validos, que cada uno pueda elegir lo que le guste realmente, que no existan tantas diferencias salariales
[5/15/20, 1:39:36 PM] Lore: en cuanto a tema económico, una renta básica independientemente si hay actividad o no, seria lo ideal, por todo lo que comentaste anteriorimente, es lo mínimo... hay muchas situaciones jodidas, y la gente no deberia quedar excluida, o pasar hambre, por no tener comida básica
[5/15/20, 1:39:44 PM] Joe: A more equitable future for everyone basically. Sounds reasonable
[5/15/20, 1:40:21 PM] Joe: I’ll send you a hat 😂
[5/15/20, 1:41:32 PM] Lore: y bueno, Mujica, por ejemplo en Uruguay adoptó medidas que para mi son significativas, son una evolución, y me siento orgullosa que en un pais de america latina se hayan adoptado medidas como, legalizacion de marihuana,  matrimonio homosexual, opcion a aboto legal, y ayudas para gente pobre
[5/15/20, 1:43:18 PM] Joe: Damn y’all beat us to legalizing weed? Fuck I’m going to Uruguay hahah
[5/15/20, 1:43:30 PM] Joe: You can meet me there 😂
[5/15/20, 1:44:14 PM] Joe: But all of the other things are good as well. You should be proud. I’m embarrassed to be from America sometimes 🤦‍♂️

[5/15/20, 3:14:13 PM] Lore: que grande es, jajaja quiero ver cuando lo cortes!
[5/15/20, 3:15:16 PM] Lore: Vos con los aguacates, y Angela con Oni jajaja
[5/15/20, 3:22:17 PM] Joe: Yeah definitely send more. Though I would rather see in person you with your dogs haha


The small avocado is grown in Mexico. The big one is a Hawaiian avocado haha. They’re huge. I’m going to use the big one for guacamole. I’ll send photos or video when I cut it open.
[5/15/20, 3:37:41 PM] Lore: que maravilla! y son baratos los aguacates ahi no? cuanto cuesta el kg?
[5/15/20, 3:37:49 PM] Lore: acá como 5 euros ... tssss

[5/15/20, 3:45:08 PM] Joe: Mexican avocados are very expensive here. Cheap in California though. But the Hawaiian avocado you can get for free. Just find a tree somewhere or know someone that has some haha
[5/15/20, 3:45:31 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/15/20, 3:47:04 PM] Lore: 👩‍🌾 agucates gratisss, que suertee
[5/15/20, 3:51:42 PM] Joe: This was me all day long when I worked in healthcare hahahah
[5/15/20, 3:53:33 PM] Joe: I worked in pharmacy and it felt like government approved drug dealing though haha especially in the area i worked. Lots of pain killers and stuff like that.
[5/15/20, 3:54:05 PM] Joe: Oh and I’m not sure what the avocados weigh 🤷‍♂️

[5/15/20, 8:53:08 PM] Lore: Y cómo decidiste trabajar ahí, estudiaste algo de farmacia también?
[5/15/20, 8:54:35 PM] Lore: Jaja, era cuánto dinero es el kilo de aguacate ahí en un supermercado.. acá 5euros
[5/15/20, 8:55:59 PM] Joe: Holaaa. buenos días! I just woke up from a nap haha confused as can be 😂
[5/15/20, 8:58:19 PM] Lore: Jijij
[5/15/20, 8:58:41 PM] Joe: No worries about falling asleep. It’s too early. You need a few more hours haha. 


I studied to be a pharmacy technician. Like the assistant. I still have my license to work in the pharmacy but I kind of hated that job. Very miserable. 

Oh and I’ll check avocado prices next time I’m at the store. I don’t remember off the top of my head. 


Now get some more sleep haha

[5/16/20, 12:46:51 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/16/20, 12:47:23 AM] Lore: Esto es lo primero que veo al despertar
[5/16/20, 12:48:32 AM] Joe: What do you use to sleep? Some ear plugs? Most birds don’t wake me, but there is one that is way too loud. It gets me every time. 

This is one place we are not alike haha. I wake up pretty easily. That’s ok though haha
[5/16/20, 12:48:38 AM] Lore: Me encanta la planta, siempre la llevo cuando cambio de casa
‎[5/16/20, 12:49:22 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/16/20, 12:50:10 AM] Joe: Haha it’s you’re little travel companion.
[5/16/20, 12:51:34 AM] Lore: Jaja por eso, usa tapones! Te decía en el audio "normalmente no me molesta la luz ni los ruidos para dormir, pero de vez en cuando pruebo a usar tapones y cuando los uso, es increíble, duermo mejor, solo te concentras en dormir jaja, así que podrías probarlos vos que tenés el sueño raro"
[5/16/20, 12:51:35 AM] Joe: They have these all over here. Really big ones. Yours look well taken care of though. I know a bunch of chicks that got super into plants hahaha mostly my friends girlfriends but I see a lot of random plant related stuff because of that
[5/16/20, 12:52:21 AM] Lore: Siiii! Y estos dos también
[5/16/20, 12:52:22 AM] Joe: Haha I heard most but i definitely missed the weird dream part. Interesting 🤔

[5/16/20, 12:57:39 AM] Joe: I don’t think I have any cool stuff I bring everywhere. I need to get some stuff like that.

[5/16/20, 1:00:09 AM] Lore: Jaja no?? Seguro algo sí
[5/16/20, 1:01:26 AM] Joe: When I came to Hawaii I brought one suitcase full of clothes, my skateboard, and my computer. But all of that is replaceable non sentimental stuff.
[5/16/20, 1:01:49 AM] Joe: I don’t need much haha
[5/16/20, 1:03:29 AM] Joe: I mean, no necesito mucho
 
I should probably practice haha at least with my short sentences
[5/16/20, 1:04:18 AM] Lore: Bueno el skate seguramente algo sentimental tenga
[5/16/20, 1:05:11 AM] Lore: Yo puedo mudarme a cualquier lugar, pero necesito marcarlo con cosas mías jaja   me siento más cómoda
[5/16/20, 1:05:40 AM] Lore: ✅
‎[5/16/20, 1:06:14 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/16/20, 1:06:39 AM] Joe: I thing the concept and culture of skateboarding is sentimental but the board itself not so much haha
[5/16/20, 1:07:15 AM] Joe: Oh shit you’re right! I forgot about that. Probably because I just got it. Alright. That’s my first item 😂 😂 A fucking paddington bear
[5/16/20, 1:08:30 AM] Lore: Jaja ya te conozco un poquito
[5/16/20, 1:10:52 AM] Joe: Eso es bueno. Puedes hacer cualquier lugar en casa

[5/16/20, 1:11:56 AM] Joe: 😂 you probably know things about me some of my oldest friends don’t. Like most things I’ve told you about my family haha

[5/16/20, 1:31:34 AM] Lore: Che, se me acaba de venir a la cabeza tu abuela ... Haceme un audio con la diferencia de palabras entre mierda y sábana. Imagínate que algún día tengo que decir "cámbiame las sábanas" 😯

[5/16/20, 1:51:41 AM] Joe: I’m sure there are words like that in spanish. Some regular item that is super close to a bad word?
[5/16/20, 1:53:21 AM] Joe: Yeah they’re super similar. I’m not surprised either but it’s a good story haha
[5/16/20, 1:55:48 AM] Lore: jajaja siempre que tenga que pronunciar alguna de esas palabras en publico, recordaré a tu abuela
[5/16/20, 1:56:42 AM] Lore: yo siento que son muy parecidas, quiero decir... a vos si te escucho la diferencia, pero cuando yo lo pronuncio siento que es las dos suenas casi igual
[5/16/20, 2:00:04 AM] Joe: You know too much 🤫
[5/16/20, 2:00:54 AM] Joe: Haha I understand. There are words in Spanish that are like that to me. I’ll get a whole different meaning from a sentence because I misheard a word or two 😂
[5/16/20, 2:04:29 AM] Lore: quería buscar en youtube algun video con palabras parecidas en español
[5/16/20, 2:04:44 AM] Lore: jajaja y estoy viendo todos los videos que hay de español, americanos practicando, etc jajajaja

[5/16/20, 2:43:28 AM] Lore: también se puede decir así!!!
[5/16/20, 2:44:38 AM] Joe: Aaah ok. So many ways to say things. That’s good though. When I finally learn I’ll have a lot more ways to describe what I’m feeling or thinking.
[5/16/20, 2:45:47 AM] Lore: exacto, pero si decis cielo naranja te entiende la gente perfectamente, yo lo digo así..
[5/16/20, 2:45:57 AM] Lore: sunset: atardecer
[5/16/20, 2:46:23 AM] Lore: Where did you go?
[5/16/20, 2:48:06 AM] Joe: Target hahaha. My sister wanted to buy a bookshelf so she asked me to come so I could help her carry it. This was on the car ride over to the store.

[5/16/20, 2:52:06 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYp5xtkoF6M&t=20s
[5/16/20, 2:54:15 AM] Lore: Look at it when you feel like it, the story of his grandma is incredible, the boy speaks super Spanish, 
mixes ENG and SPA
[5/16/20, 2:55:07 AM] Joe: Just clicked it and I already know I’m going to like it haha. I love videos about polyglots.


I used to watch this one guy go to places and surprise people by speaking to them in their language
[5/16/20, 2:55:20 AM] Joe: I’ll watch it now
[5/16/20, 2:56:16 AM] Lore: okey, ahora me contás que te pareció! a mi me parece super inspirador y admirable!
[5/16/20, 3:03:42 AM] Joe: Damn I’m halfway through and this lady is already speaking hella languages at 25 hahaha. Boss lady
[5/16/20, 3:05:02 AM] Lore: jajaja, a ella la necesidad hizo que aprenda un idioma, no paró de viajar
[5/16/20, 3:05:16 AM] Lore: en cierto modo como tu abuela, aprendió un idioma, por necesidad de vivir en otro pais
[5/16/20, 3:05:34 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67XAq4vQywQ
[5/16/20, 3:06:27 AM] Lore: I think you might like this one, this guy expresses himself super well
[5/16/20, 3:14:48 AM] Joe: lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el video del puño
[5/16/20, 3:15:56 AM] Joe: That lady is cool. And the guy knows a bunch of languages too. I’m trying to do that haha. We’ll see how it goes with spanish first haha
[5/16/20, 3:16:43 AM] Lore: puño = 👊🏻
[5/16/20, 3:17:13 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s the best way to learn
[5/16/20, 3:17:26 AM] Lore: si, los dos son geniales!
[5/16/20, 3:19:33 AM] Joe: Haha okey. lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el primer video.

???  🤔
[5/16/20, 3:20:25 AM] Joe: True!
[5/16/20, 3:21:29 AM] Lore: si, primer video. puño, es puñetazo, golpe..fight
[5/16/20, 3:23:03 AM] Joe: Cool. Gracias. I’m just starting to watch the second video now. Is it about being introverted? I like this topic hahah I read a book called Introvert Power.
[5/16/20, 3:29:17 AM] Joe: Soooo yeah....I’m super introverted. And in the way he describes. That’s how the book explains it too. I’m drained by too many people and superficial relationships and energized by being alone or with someone I connect with on a deeper level. 

I only have my few close friends and that’s how I like it haha
[5/16/20, 3:32:46 AM] Joe: Wait....why did you decide to send me that? 

What are you trying to say about me here?


Also, how would you describe yourself in relation to what he was saying?
[5/16/20, 3:36:35 AM] Lore: mmm.. te lo envié porque los videos de este chico me parecen interesantes, toca temas de los que ya hablamos, como idioma, y personalidad.. por lo que nos conocemos por acá, se podría decir que vos sos más introvertido y yo más extrovertida, pero al final yo creo que ahora, ambos estamos balanceados. Me pareció bueno, como el chico habló también de la personalidad de una persona introvertida, su visión, e incluso diferentes etapas de la vida en las que ejerces un rol diferente.
[5/16/20, 3:39:24 AM] Lore: mi madre siempre me dijo que tuve mucho caracter, aunque en el colegio, tenia una personalidad más introvertida.. no sé hasta que punto, pero recuerdo que era más tímida, a partir de los 15 años, todo eso se esfumó sin darme cuenta.
[5/16/20, 3:40:57 AM] Joe: Yeah that video was relatable. I enjoy our balance for sure haha there’s something really nice about it that makes it fun
[5/16/20, 3:41:31 AM] Joe: You’re definitely a character haha. I can’t imagine you being very shy but that’s interesting to know.
[5/16/20, 3:43:06 AM] Lore: Por ejemplo, el trabajo donde estamos con Sandra, fue un proceso de selección de entrevista individual y grupal, y luego hicimos un viaje a Barcelona, para formación todo el equipo. Sandra era suuuuuuper timida,  y yo polo opuesto, ni nos hablamos durante entrevista, yo cree vinculo con otras personas más activas, y luego al final, trabajando, empezamos a charlar diferentes cosas, y ahora es la persona con la que mejor me llevo. A día de hoy, hablamos de eso y nos parece curioso como al final llegamos a el punto, incluso vivir juntas
[5/16/20, 3:43:30 AM] Lore: jajaja yo... blablabla .. sorry
[5/16/20, 3:44:06 AM] Joe: Don’t be sorry. Tell me everything
[5/16/20, 3:48:05 AM] Joe: Hahaha you have a way of connecting with the shy introverts. Must have some good vibes
[5/16/20, 3:52:18 AM] Joe: Send more thoughts my way whenever you want. I really do want to hear it all.
[5/16/20, 3:52:31 AM] Joe: But right now I’m tired haha so I’m going to bed
[5/16/20, 3:54:18 AM] Joe: I think we covered a lot of ground today hahah some good stuff 😂 

Anyway, I’ll talk to you later. Have a beautiful day 😘
[5/16/20, 3:59:22 AM] Lore: jajaja no sé, me encanta hacer vinculos con todo el mundo, incluso con una hormiga que pase por al lado mio.. jajaja pero tengo que reconocer, que me atrae cuando alguien es introvertido, quiero romper esa barrera y que conmigo sea una persona más abierta, no sé jaja no sé si entenderás esto..
[5/16/20, 4:00:11 AM] Lore: claro... durante tu día todo fue más intenso, más cosas, mi día de ayer fue politica, hoy idiomas y "psicología"
[5/16/20, 4:00:36 AM] Lore: sleep super well, next night, with plugs! a kiss !!!
[5/16/20, 4:04:01 AM] Joe: Haha I understand. 


Now that you’ve broken my barrier I kind of wish you weren’t so far away though 😂 

K, talk to you later

[5/16/20, 11:31:39 AM] Joe: My handwriting is so bad hahaha. By the way, random fact, I’m left handed haha
[5/16/20, 11:35:07 AM] Joe: It was a good lesson though. She was telling me about how she speaks a different Spanish than they do in Mexico. Probably more like from Spain. She said it would be “Castellano” o “Castilian”


She also told me about some crazy gold mountains and a recent discovery of an ancient civilization that was bigger than Manchu Picchu and now I really want to go to Peru and see what she is talking about
[5/16/20, 11:39:38 AM] Lore: Jajajaja

[5/16/20, 1:49:46 PM] Joe: Haha walking in the rain? That bench looks like something I could skate.
[5/16/20, 1:51:39 PM] Joe: My bad for leaving you a bunch of messages 🤗 had to send those videos though haha
[5/16/20, 1:52:26 PM] Lore: Síii se puso a llover ahora hace hace un ratito

[5/16/20, 2:10:24 PM] Lore: Contame eso de la clase con tu abuela!
[5/16/20, 2:10:34 PM] Lore: Esas notas fue lo que hablaste con ella?
[5/16/20, 2:12:18 PM] Lore: Quiero saberlo todo contamelooo
[5/16/20, 2:15:17 PM] Joe: Hah yeah those notes are what we’ve been talking about. And then after the lesson she will tell me about how people in my family speak Spanish. She said my aunt and uncle are ok but they get lazy and don’t speak Spanish enough then lose it but apparently my dad is the best at speaking haha.
[5/16/20, 2:16:16 PM] Joe: She is trying to make me talk to him in spanish to practice. But for now we go over what we would say to each other in the morning. Greetings, about breakfast and coffee ahah, and today we talked about going for a walk and just what we would see
[5/16/20, 2:17:07 PM] Lore: 👏👏👏
[5/16/20, 2:17:20 PM] Lore: Jaja son tiernas las notas de español jajajaja
[5/16/20, 2:18:20 PM] Joe: It’s good practice. She talks to me really slow most of the time haha. It’s fun though, we talk for about an hour each morning to practice
[5/16/20, 2:19:08 PM] Lore: Jaja pero hoy es el primer día? O ya hablabas con ella antes en español?
[5/16/20, 2:20:27 PM] Lore: No le dijiste aún a tu padre que hablas español? Jaja el es el mejor según tu abuela jajja
[5/16/20, 2:21:00 PM] Lore: Puedo imaginarme en las notas la conversación jaja
[5/16/20, 2:21:17 PM] Joe: We started a few days ago. I usually only speak to her in English
[5/16/20, 2:21:17 PM] Lore: Tu abuela es la que te dice que estás despeinado, en pijama, que te quiere
[5/16/20, 2:21:58 PM] Lore: Y ella cansada, miedo( supongo que por corona) etc jaja
[5/16/20, 2:22:12 PM] Lore: O igual me lo estoy inventado yo jajaja
[5/16/20, 2:22:20 PM] Joe: He’ll be the last to know. Unless someone tells him haha
[5/16/20, 2:22:26 PM] Lore: Ohhh no me lo habías contado Joe!
[5/16/20, 2:22:48 PM] Lore: 😂😂😂😂
[5/16/20, 2:24:33 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[5/16/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: 📝
[5/16/20, 2:25:05 PM] Lore: Yo también voy a hablarte más lento entonces jajaja 🙅
[5/16/20, 2:26:49 PM] Joe: So the scared thing...she was telling me “no tengas miedo de la pronounciación o tu no aprenderá” 

Something like that
[5/16/20, 2:28:30 PM] Joe: Haha sorry I thought I told you 🤔 

Pero, si, hablar lento a mí jaja
[5/16/20, 2:32:29 PM] Lore: claro...no tengas miedo.. al final puede ser gracioso
[5/16/20, 2:32:29 PM] Lore: si me lo dijiste, lo intento.. pero hay veces que se me escapa y hablo rapido
[5/16/20, 2:33:21 PM] Lore: *pero si, hablame lento
[5/16/20, 2:38:01 PM] Joe: Mierda

Pero si, hablame lento

😂 👍
[5/16/20, 2:39:46 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t mind making mistakes with her, she just corrects me and we continue. And it has definitely been fun mispronouncing words with you. I was laughing too much trying to pronounce words yesterday haha
[5/16/20, 2:42:31 PM] Lore: jajaja podrás elegir algunas palabras en inglés, e intentaré pronunciarlas para que sea justo y te puedas reir de mi también jaja
[5/16/20, 2:43:07 PM] Lore: cuando vuelvas a california, ya hablarás un poco de español jaja

[5/16/20, 2:52:49 PM] Joe: “Joe, lets go to the beach today” it’s simple and seems boring but beach is so similar to bitch haha it’ll be good
[5/16/20, 2:54:55 PM] Lore: jajaja
‎[5/16/20, 2:56:16 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/16/20, 2:57:04 PM] Lore: Si tuviese que decir bitch creo que lo diría igual, así que no sé si estoy diciendo playa o no jaja
[5/16/20, 3:01:31 PM] Joe: Hahahahahah! Fuckin ronronear!!! 

Aaah very good. I definitely wouldn’t confuse it with how you pronounced it.
‎[5/16/20, 3:03:09 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/16/20, 3:03:11 PM] Lore: jajaaj y como se diria bitch? por si lo tengo que usar en algun momento....
[5/16/20, 3:03:43 PM] Lore: ah justo acaba de llegar el audio
[5/16/20, 3:04:16 PM] Lore: Mmmm
[5/16/20, 3:04:34 PM] Lore: No sé pronunciar bitch
[5/16/20, 3:04:45 PM] Lore: 😭
[5/16/20, 3:05:02 PM] Lore: Con lo útil que puede ser... Mierda jaja
‎[5/16/20, 3:05:30 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/16/20, 3:06:24 PM] Joe: You need both. One for going to the beach and the other for talking shit haha
[5/16/20, 3:06:48 PM] Lore: Jajaj ambas me gustan y son útiles
[5/16/20, 3:07:31 PM] Joe: Put them on your list

[5/16/20, 3:11:54 PM] Joe: I like the first one. If only I could save it hahaha
[5/16/20, 3:13:25 PM] Lore: jajajaja mi paciencia duró segundos
[5/16/20, 3:14:57 PM] Joe: Haha you got it super fast. It was good by the end
[5/16/20, 3:16:02 PM] Lore: puede ser que beach sea más con la "i"? y bitch, más con la "e"?
[5/16/20, 3:16:40 PM] Lore: mmm ajaj esto no sirve, mi i y mi e, no suenan como las tuyas
[5/16/20, 3:16:54 PM] Lore: como la i y la e de español
[5/16/20, 3:19:22 PM] Lore: más, más ,másss
[5/16/20, 3:19:23 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it sounds “ea” sounds like spanish “i”. And the “i” sometimes sounds like spanish “e” but sometimes sound like the word “ay”
[5/16/20, 3:20:36 PM] Joe: English is hard to learn I’ve heard
[5/16/20, 3:21:26 PM] Lore: ay dios.. jaja nuestras conversaciones.... mi "i" mi "e".. tu "e" como ay... por otro lado... mi mañana tu noche, mi noche tu tarde.. jajajaja
[5/16/20, 3:21:29 PM] Joe: Because it doesn’t make sense. Spanish has a lot of ways to say things but mostly follows a smaller set of rules than English.
[5/16/20, 3:21:47 PM] Joe: Hahahah
[5/16/20, 3:22:37 PM] Lore: https://www.instagram.com/p/B-495q2Isry/?igshid=xrae6dw99968
[5/16/20, 3:23:05 PM] Joe: Our conversations are kind of weird but it’s interesting. Learning about the differences directly from someone across the globe
[5/16/20, 3:24:33 PM] Lore: si jajaj es genial!!

[5/16/20, 3:28:03 PM] Joe: Hahahah that video makes me laugh every time. Ooh it’s too good
[5/16/20, 3:28:39 PM] Lore: AY que bueno sigo riendome jajajaja cada vez que escucho el original y suena asi
[5/16/20, 3:29:20 PM] Lore: al parecer, la rubia esa... es Youtuber, como vos .. jajajajaja
[5/16/20, 3:30:07 PM] Lore: y ella hace un monton de videos, su novio es mexicano creo.. vi alguno y pfff... es muy pija tonta..

[5/16/20, 3:37:31 PM] Lore: jjajaja lo siento, pero si
[5/16/20, 3:37:39 PM] Lore: soy fan del canguro
[5/16/20, 3:44:31 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure
[5/16/20, 3:44:46 PM] Joe: I thought for a second you love the idea of kicking me into a pond hahaha
[5/16/20, 3:45:49 PM] Joe: Maybe save that for when you get really mad at me. 

Which reminds me...question...what are you like when you get mad?? Haha
[5/16/20, 3:47:10 PM] Lore: uououo yo enojada?
[5/16/20, 3:47:49 PM] Lore: de verdad querés saberlo? jajaja
[5/16/20, 3:49:00 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah for sure. You can be honest. If you have a lot of passion when you’re angry that’s ok. I would rather have honesty and learn to work with the kind of person you really are than to have you try and hide it
[5/16/20, 3:49:55 PM] Lore: jajaa yo no oculto nada, soy bastante transparente con la gente que me conoce... mmm
[5/16/20, 3:52:31 PM] Lore: me considero una persona con carácter, cada vez que algo no me gusta o no es justo, lo digo, rara vez me callo. Me suelo llevar bien con la gente, me gusta hacer bromas, ayudar, compartir, pero si es una persona interesada, egoista, toxica... no me interesa en absoluto, y cuando alguien no me interesa puedo ser "mala"
‎[5/16/20, 3:53:48 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/16/20, 3:54:45 PM] Lore: en cuanto a enojarme,con amigas o familiares, etc...puede que me altere un poco, depende.. pero no me duran los enfados demasiado, siempre confio en el dialogo, la comunicación...
[5/16/20, 3:54:59 PM] Lore: jajajaja mierda
[5/16/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll believe you. Communication is definitely the key. Which makes this hard 😂 

But people can communicate a lot with actions as well I guess
[5/16/20, 3:59:06 PM] Lore: mmm jaja intento ser objetiva en la respuesta, aunque es dificil describirse, depende la época, situación, persona, etc...
[5/16/20, 3:59:13 PM] Lore: y vos, que? eh eh eh
[5/16/20, 4:02:44 PM] Joe: Hahah eh eh eh

I’m very calm for the most part. I try to work situations out or just walk away and come back to it later. Depends. I’ve had my moments of getting very angry when I was younger for sure but as I got older I’ve become less worried about the things that upset me
[5/16/20, 4:04:10 PM] Joe: pinochio siempre me recordará a ti ahora

[5/16/20, 4:47:38 PM] Joe: Aah yeah corny/cheesy same meaning in English when you use it that way. But ok sounds good, prepare your questions. I’ll try to keep my answer short.

It suits you well haha

[5/17/20, 4:12:17 AM] Joe: We basically fucked the whole response and it’s been like this for most of the time with people not listening. But in different places across the country at different times.
[5/17/20, 4:12:23 AM] Joe: Then we have weird enforcement where police will patrol poor neighborhoods and keep them on a much more serious lockdown than the rich neighborhoods
[5/17/20, 4:13:43 AM] Lore: tsssss
[5/17/20, 4:14:03 AM] Joe: It’s the worst. Especially in places like New York
[5/17/20, 4:14:18 AM] Lore: gente ignorante no se divide por clases sociales, si uno es más rico o más pobre
[5/17/20, 4:14:56 AM] Lore: hay gente tomando decisiones muy malas, que afectan a todos, incluso mundialmente
[5/17/20, 4:15:12 AM] Joe: Yeah but the police let the rich gather in their parks and literally beat and arrest the poor for being outside in their neighborhoods
[5/17/20, 4:15:45 AM] Lore: puto ascooo
[5/17/20, 4:16:21 AM] Joe: It’s so weird to see a video of cops assaulting someone for being outside without a mask...instead of maybe just giving them a mask
[5/17/20, 4:16:47 AM] Joe: It doesn’t make sense cause now there are a bunch of cops touching this person to arrest them
[5/17/20, 4:17:10 AM] Joe: They should be distancing themselves not touching people. Shits crazy
[5/17/20, 4:17:25 AM] Lore: no tiene sentido, pero siempre la policia abusa de poder...
[5/17/20, 4:17:38 AM] Joe: True
[5/17/20, 4:18:36 AM] Lore: acá en la ciudad se ve de todo, mucha gente corriendo sin mascarilla.. es incomoda? si, pero hay que intentar llevarla.. por que un día se puede contagiar alguien de tu familia, o la gente no tendrá como vivir por la falta de trabajo, creo que hay gente que no es consciente de esta situación
‎[5/17/20, 4:19:30 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/17/20, 4:20:20 AM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/17/20, 4:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s what made one of the videos of a cop arresting someone for not having a mask so ridiculous. A few of the officers were wearing there mask like that haha
[5/17/20, 4:23:01 AM] Joe: It’s impossible to get 100% of the humans to believe it all and to actively participate in keeping everyone safe. Some people just don’t trust sources of authority telling them what to do
[5/17/20, 4:25:08 AM] Lore: yo tampoco confio mucho, pero intento tener respeto y consideración, es algo temporal, y tenemos que recuperar la normalidad... yo no lo estoy pasando mal, no me falta comida, ni me aburro, hago cosas, estoy sana, etc... pero no paro de pensar en que hay gente que si, que debe estar pasando una muy mala situación, y hay que ser un poquito responsable y tener empatía...
[5/17/20, 4:27:33 AM] Joe: Yeah the more we have stuff like that picture, the longer it will take to go to normal
[5/17/20, 4:28:42 AM] Joe: Hopefully there are more people doing the right thing than the wrong thing. Around here most wear their mask and keep their distance. Beaches are mostly empty but I think they are starting to open them this week.
[5/17/20, 4:29:32 AM] Joe: Oh and tell me what you thought about the video. I watched it again hahaha I forgot how old that video is
[5/17/20, 4:31:07 AM] Lore: Si ahí por lo que me muestras, no hay gente parece... acá mucha... yo no sé si en algún momento me contagiaré... cada vez que salgo es inevitable mantener la distancia, como zombies en una ciudad, hay muchas personas para las calles..
[5/17/20, 4:32:01 AM] Lore: Si, me pareció interesante el análisis, y el resultado, no había pensado en ello. La historia del Jean y el médico es muy real.. jaja
[5/17/20, 4:34:10 AM] Joe: Yeah it seems a little weirder being in a bigger city. It’ll be an adjustment going back to California. There are a lot of people in the Bay Area.
[5/17/20, 4:35:07 AM] Lore: es como que tenemos una presión a decidir bien, y no fracasar. Hay gente que no lo toma tan serio, no da demasiada importancia. Yo tomo notas, cuando tengo que tomar decisiones, necesito hacer esquema o listas, pros y contras, y así lo veo mucho más claro, hay veces que me funciona jajaja
[5/17/20, 4:35:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I especially liked the medicine story. Doctors giving the patients the choice even though the doctor has the knowledge and the way medications are marketed
[5/17/20, 4:35:32 AM] Lore: Volvés al final, dónde vas a vivir, en lo de tus padres?
[5/17/20, 4:36:35 AM] Lore: Si, pero totalmente cierto... esperamos que otra persona decida, ya que se supone que tiene mejores conocimientos.. entonces nos relajamos y esa decisión no es nuestra
[5/17/20, 4:37:30 AM] Joe: I don’t know....and I only have 3 weeks to find out. I might have a friend I can stay with if I can’t find anything.
[5/17/20, 4:37:40 AM] Lore: y vos que haces a la hora de tomar decisiones, te cuesta o utilizas alguna tecnica?
[5/17/20, 4:39:59 AM] Joe: 🤔 when I pick something I do a lot of research if it’s an expensive item. 
If it’s something like choosing which bread from the store, I don’t know haha
[5/17/20, 4:41:37 AM] Joe: Usually I just get the same thing every time once I find something I like. Then I don’t have to choose
[5/17/20, 4:45:10 AM] Lore: hay algo que te costó más tiempo en decidir, decisiones de vida? o algo a día de hoy, que no tengas claro que decisión tomar?
[5/17/20, 4:45:57 AM] Lore: mmm es tarde ahi, si querés me lo contas en otro momento u otro día!
[5/17/20, 4:49:08 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m going to bed soon. But um...just deciding what to do with my life hahaha
I don’t know how to explain it
[5/17/20, 4:49:51 AM] Joe: Like my decision where to live, who to be, what things do I want to be able to say I’ve done when my life is over. The hard stuff haha
‎[5/17/20, 4:53:35 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/17/20, 4:54:12 AM] Lore: estamos en la edad de tener que elegir todas estas cosas! jaja
[5/17/20, 4:54:40 AM] Lore: supuuuuestamente... jjj
[5/17/20, 4:55:02 AM] Lore: jajaja que duermas muy bien, muak! 😘
[5/17/20, 4:55:53 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah we are 😂 


Ok. I’ll talk to you later. Have a good day 😘

[5/17/20, 11:26:28 AM] Joe: 😂 I tried to send that like an hour ago but it never sent. But now I’m up!!
[5/17/20, 11:26:50 AM] Joe: I wanted to send you this link so you can see how stupid Americans are in real time hahah

[5/17/20, 12:03:29 PM] Joe: How was your day? Did you get to do anything today?
[5/17/20, 1:42:11 PM] Lore: Eyyyy
[5/17/20, 1:44:03 PM] Lore: Perdona estaba en la calle con Luchi

[5/17/20, 1:56:43 PM] Joe: Haha I’m going to have to listen to that a bunch of times to get the whole thing but don’t translate it. I’ll use it to practice haha

[5/17/20, 2:07:00 PM] Joe: And you are getting a lot of flowers in nature because there are no gardeners hahah. Very nice.

[5/17/20, 2:08:35 PM] Joe: Sweet. There are still a bunch of words I miss or don’t understand but I can get barely enough to make a story in my head about what you say 😂

[5/17/20, 3:07:29 PM] Lore: Cuando termine de cenar
[5/17/20, 3:07:33 PM] Lore: Te escribo lo que te dije
[5/17/20, 3:07:44 PM] Lore: Así podés escuchar y leerlo
[5/17/20, 3:07:56 PM] Lore: Y aprender esas palabras que no sabes okey?
[5/17/20, 3:10:50 PM] Joe: Yeah that’ll be good. Enjoy dinner. I’m waiting for “Lahaina noon” where the sun is directly overhead and vertical objects have no shadow.
[5/17/20, 3:12:21 PM] Lore: Que? No entendí nada de eso
[5/17/20, 3:12:28 PM] Lore: De lahaiana Moon
[5/17/20, 3:12:30 PM] Lore: Noon
[5/17/20, 3:13:52 PM] Joe: Hmm I don’t have a link in spanish but I have this Wikipedia link 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina_Noon
‎[5/17/20, 3:14:53 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/17/20, 3:16:28 PM] Joe: Basically it’s when you are at the “sub solar point” or the point directly under the sun. Hawaii is the only place on land that it happens in the US.
[5/17/20, 3:17:33 PM] Joe: Damn the clouds are going to ruin it 😡

[5/17/20, 4:22:26 PM] Lore: ví un video también como no se ven las sombras
[5/17/20, 4:23:00 PM] Lore: y vos hiciste la foto justo en el momento!
[5/17/20, 4:24:32 PM] Joe: You watched a video about it? 

Yeah I’m glad I got to see it. I heard about this a long time ago.
[5/17/20, 4:25:15 PM] Lore: Siii, de un hombre que pone varios objetos y justo ocurre, lo graba y solo se ve su sombra pero el resto no
[5/17/20, 4:25:33 PM] Lore: un video muy corto para ver que era jaja
[5/17/20, 4:25:43 PM] Lore: mmm la lección si, cierto!
[5/17/20, 4:25:52 PM] Lore: voy a ver que te dije que no me acuerdo exactamente jajajaja
[5/17/20, 4:28:28 PM] Lore: "un poquito de español, lento... mi amiga se llama Lucia pero su apodo es Luchi, y la fui a acompañar un poco, porque ella vive como a mm 30, 20, 25 minutos de casa caminando. Quedamos a las 8 y estuvimos caminando hasta ahora que son las 11 de la noche, dimos una vuelta con Rogel que es el perro y super bienn"
[5/17/20, 4:28:37 PM] Lore: te lo escribí exacto
[5/17/20, 4:29:20 PM] Lore: 2 audio "parezco estupida diciendo "apodo" se dice apodo, normal" ( en el audio anterior te lo intenté decir lento pero fue demasiado jajaja
[5/17/20, 4:30:03 PM] Joe: Hahah gracias!
[5/17/20, 4:30:13 PM] Joe: My own personal subtitles 😂
[5/17/20, 4:30:42 PM] Lore: la naturaleza esta salvaje ahora, las plantas... no hay jardineros trabajando entonces esta toda la ciudad llena de plantas, arbustos, flores.. porque es primavera y esta super lindo, los bancos, las barandillas, todo.. todo esta lleno de plantas"
[5/17/20, 4:31:15 PM] Lore: jaja para que veas...como te cuido eh eh!!!
[5/17/20, 4:32:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha I really appreciate it. You’ve helped me improve a lot so that’s cool
‎[5/17/20, 4:33:07 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/17/20, 4:34:39 PM] Joe: Alright I’m going to read your subtitles a couple of times and then listen again and see how much more I can hear
[5/17/20, 4:35:49 PM] Lore: bien, acá estaré por si me necesitas!
[5/17/20, 4:36:21 PM] Lore: de nada, encantada! 😙

It’s late there now but tomorrow you still have to ask those questions for me to give video answers
‎[5/17/20, 4:45:55 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/17/20, 4:46:31 PM] Lore: no, el otro que me grabaste hablando
[5/17/20, 4:46:53 PM] Lore: jaja el de esta mañana me hizo gracia lo ví en la calle!
[5/17/20, 4:49:50 PM] Joe: Hahaha you would probably enjoy not being able to understand me. Just nod and go “mhmm” or “no” and see what happens 😂
[5/17/20, 4:51:09 PM] Lore: jaja si te entendí, casi todo. pero no podía parar de mirar esos rulos sexys

[5/17/20, 4:53:55 PM] Lore: es que cuanto más nervioso te pones, más gracia me hace
[5/17/20, 4:54:36 PM] Lore: nunca seguís el juego, pero espero que no te sientas incomodo o te moleste
[5/17/20, 4:56:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know how to play but I think it’s fine. I like the discomfort. It’s more from not being used to getting compliments and literally not knowing how to respond 😂
‎[5/17/20, 4:57:15 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/17/20, 4:58:28 PM] Lore: te sentís incómodo cuando te digo alguna de estas cosas?
[5/17/20, 5:00:15 PM] Joe: If I do it’s not in a bad way. Don’t second guess how you’re talking to me...I think everything you’ve said has been fine
[5/17/20, 5:01:39 PM] Joe: If there is something I don’t like I’ll let you know. It’s not a big deal. But like I said, so far so good
[5/17/20, 5:05:14 PM] Lore: jaja okey, me alegro que así sea entonces!
[5/17/20, 5:06:15 PM] Lore: Y si nos vemos en persona algun día, y te hago algún cumplido? jaja que harás, serás nº7 también?
[5/17/20, 5:07:28 PM] Lore: tendrás que practicarlo jaja
[5/17/20, 5:10:20 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t know what i would do 😂 

I’ve always been told I’m bad at taking compliments. I think i usually try to make a joke about it if you haven’t noticed
[5/17/20, 5:11:50 PM] Joe: So I would probably joke about whatever compliment you give me then compliment you I guess 🤔 

I’m not super smooth hahahahaha
‎[5/17/20, 5:12:34 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/17/20, 5:13:31 PM] Lore: jajaja si, me dí cuenta..!
[5/17/20, 5:14:26 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck
[5/17/20, 5:14:28 PM] Lore: jajaja esta bien saberlo!! 🤔
[5/17/20, 5:14:39 PM] Joe: Well what do normal people do?? Am I weird for that?
[5/17/20, 5:15:20 PM] Lore: mmm jaja no
[5/17/20, 5:15:27 PM] Lore: esta bien, no pasa nada!
[5/17/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Haha alright if you say so. I’ll just keep being my weird self since it seems to be working fine
[5/17/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: I wish you could just have subtitles everywhere you went because I can understand you so much better with subtitles 😂 😂
[5/17/20, 5:20:59 PM] Lore: hasta ahora si! jaja
[5/17/20, 5:21:56 PM] Lore: mmm que me querés decir? 😂
[5/17/20, 5:24:26 PM] Joe: So you can meet me sooner and I’ll understand you. You would have a little screen that shows subtitles for everything you say and you bring it everywhere hahah 

I’m better at reading Spanish than listening to it for now
[5/17/20, 5:25:40 PM] Joe: But I’m just kidding. I’m figuring this shit out. Going to be sooo good at spanish. Just give it time.
[5/17/20, 5:27:05 PM] Lore: jajaja si nos viesemos ahora, seríamos como mimos

[5/17/20, 5:34:59 PM] Joe: Mimes have excellent communication skills. Most communication is done with body language and nobody communicates with the body better than mimes haha
[5/17/20, 5:35:41 PM] Joe: Also, less of a chance for me to say something stupid that way 😆
[5/17/20, 5:36:30 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/17/20, 5:37:17 PM] Lore: 🤐🤐🤐 no diré nada al respecto jajaja

[5/18/20, 10:57:48 AM] Joe: Hahaha whaaaat? I just got off the phone before I read this. I’ll ask tomorrow. I’ve never heard of this though 😂 

Also what is “ñoquis”?
[5/18/20, 10:59:36 AM] Joe: Haha dammit I just listened to the audio too. I’ll say it tomorrow after you tell me what it means haha

[5/18/20, 11:02:18 AM] Joe: Aaah ok. Yeah she was saying not everyone uses the word tuco but she uses it a lot
[5/18/20, 11:02:19 AM] Lore: También se hace en Argentina, no sé si en Perú
[5/18/20, 11:02:41 AM] Lore: pero también es por nuestra descendencia italiana
[5/18/20, 11:04:01 AM] Lore: Exacto, en mi familia se usa la palabra tuco, pero en España no.. acá es salsa de tomate simplemente jaja
[5/18/20, 11:04:13 AM] Joe: Sounds like something I could get into. I’m trying to attract money and good things haha

[5/18/20, 11:16:24 AM] Joe: Yeah. My brain was just working slow today. She would say a long sentence to me and my brain would stop listening halfway through cause I’m still translating the beginning in my head.

[5/18/20, 11:22:11 AM] Lore: 2 segundos, muy rápido .. jaja que vas a usar la frase con tu abuela? jajaja
[5/18/20, 11:22:15 AM] Joe: That’s hella sweet of you hahaha I appreciate it. Personal video lessons haha
[5/18/20, 11:22:39 AM] Lore: no creo que le guste a tu abuela lo que te enseño, mejor no jajaja
[5/18/20, 11:23:33 AM] Joe: Hahahaha I said “I will use it, but not with my grandma” 😂 

Yeah she wouldn’t be too stoked on that haha

[5/18/20, 11:24:32 AM] Lore: 🤐🤐🤐
[5/18/20, 11:24:53 AM] Lore: Un 10!
[5/18/20, 11:24:59 AM] Lore: Que más aprendiste?
‎[5/18/20, 11:25:57 AM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/18/20, 11:27:02 AM] Joe: Not much. Today was bad haha. We just went over greeting in the morning and a pretend walk again.
[5/18/20, 11:29:29 AM] Joe: She was telling me a lot of learning strategies today. Like put stickers with the spanish word for the item on things around the house. She said watch tv and movies with spanish subtitles so I can see what they are saying and train my ear better even if I don’t necessarily understand
[5/18/20, 11:30:15 AM] Joe: Listen closely to the movies or shows and write down words I don’t understand and look them up in the dictionary
[5/18/20, 11:30:51 AM] Lore: jajaja muy bien! esta lección bien aprendida, es importante
[5/18/20, 11:31:17 AM] Lore: no puedo creer... que tu abuela te de tácticas y no le digas que estas hablando español todos los días con una persona jajajaja
[5/18/20, 11:31:43 AM] Lore: de todos modos, me parece buena idea las tácticas que te dice
[5/18/20, 11:34:00 AM] Lore: " no puedo creer" es como una manera de decir.. mmm no puedo creer.. jajaja que dificil es explicarlo
[5/18/20, 11:35:08 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’m going to tell her. I just don’t know when 😂 


I don’t tell anyone much about my life haha
[5/18/20, 11:35:16 AM] Joe: Even my family
[5/18/20, 11:36:04 AM] Lore: ahaaa
[5/18/20, 11:36:26 AM] Lore: jaja bueno
[5/18/20, 11:37:34 AM] Joe: Haha I doubt you’re telling anyone about me 😂 

It’s just the way I am though. I don’t know why I don’t like telling people what’s happening with me 🤷‍♂️
[5/18/20, 11:38:06 AM] Lore: jaja
[5/18/20, 11:38:09 AM] Lore: te equivocas
‎[5/18/20, 11:39:22 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 11:40:26 AM] Joe: I’ve mentioned you to my two closest friends but that’s it haha.
[5/18/20, 11:41:02 AM] Joe: Their minds were blown. They couldn’t imagine it 😂
[5/18/20, 11:42:27 AM] Lore: todas mis amigas lo saben, jaja hablo con casi todas siempre y no puedo ocultarlo, yo les cuento casi todo jajaja
[5/18/20, 11:43:09 AM] Lore: también lo conté para que me digan... "lore, es una locura.." pero esa no fue la respuesta de ninguna, bueno solo de una jajaja
‎[5/18/20, 11:44:29 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 11:44:38 AM] Lore: Jaja y que te dijeron?
[5/18/20, 11:46:31 AM] Joe: Hahaha they wouldn’t talk you out of it?? You must not have told them enough about me yet 😂
[5/18/20, 11:50:18 AM] Joe: Mostly “Whaaaaat!? Hahaha, you’re always doing something hella cutty” which is kind of like saying that I’m always doing stuff without many knowing. And they talked about how I’m always doing the opposite of what they’re doing in life haha ever since high school
[5/18/20, 11:51:17 AM] Joe: But they were stoked on it. A little concerned that I might leave the Bay Area for good but they know wherever I go they’re welcome to visit so it’s bittersweet I guess
[5/18/20, 11:55:16 AM] Lore: Your defense weapon, the joke.. jaja todas me dijeron que me vayan si quiero, y que era bonita "la historia" jajaja
[5/18/20, 11:57:20 AM] Lore: jajaja como por ejemplo, cosas que no se imaginan, eso lo contrario?
[5/18/20, 11:58:00 AM] Lore: ohhhh jaja sii!!!
[5/18/20, 12:01:02 PM] Joe: Well when I first told them about you I said I was considering trying to see you. Maybe in Spain. They all traveled internationally without me a few years back. I was too busy working to go. Now it’s the opposite, I have time to travel and they’re all very busy. 

And now I’m single, talking to some girl from across the world, and they all have girlfriends. But like i told you, I had a few very long term relationships, all while my friends were single hahaha. They all had long crazy hair in high school, i stayed clean cut.
[5/18/20, 12:01:29 PM] Joe: Now I’m a mess and they’re all clean cut haha. I don’t know. I’m just always doing my own thing
[5/18/20, 12:02:25 PM] Lore: jajaja a contracorriente
‎[5/18/20, 12:03:38 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 12:04:01 PM] Joe: I must take some kind of pride in being “different” because I’ve always been this way haha.
[5/18/20, 12:04:08 PM] Joe: Basically Hahahaha
[5/18/20, 12:04:33 PM] Joe: I didn’t even notice until my friends pointed it out though
[5/18/20, 12:04:42 PM] Lore: Si, me gusta lo diferente!
[5/18/20, 12:05:16 PM] Lore: jajaja es genial cuando nuestros amigos, dan sus opiniones
[5/18/20, 12:06:55 PM] Joe: For sure. Especially these dudes. I’ve been friends with them since I was 12 haha so they know me well and can tell me things I don’t notice about my own personality
‎[5/18/20, 12:10:13 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/18/20, 12:12:07 PM] Lore: si es genial, bueno tengo que reconocer que me gusta que lo hayas contado jajaja
[5/18/20, 12:12:14 PM] Lore: vaaamos! bien ahi
[5/18/20, 12:13:48 PM] Lore: estoy dentro!
[5/18/20, 12:14:36 PM] Lore: ay que te ibas a patinar, jaja perdón
‎[5/18/20, 12:14:52 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/18/20, 12:15:08 PM] Joe: Haha yeah but we’ll play later! The sound makes it better for sure
[5/18/20, 12:16:06 PM] Joe: The mini detail will make the project look much better in the eyes of a recruiter or potential client if I show it to them. It still feels unfinished to me. I’m working on adding the gifs next hahaha
[5/18/20, 12:16:08 PM] Joe: We need them
[5/18/20, 12:16:49 PM] Joe: I’m learning so much in quarantine 😂
[5/18/20, 12:21:21 PM] Lore: well I'm glad so! You have a lot of potential to show, and of course this quarantine in Hawaii is being useful!
[5/18/20, 12:21:56 PM] Lore: I'm going to feel sorry when I'm done and I don't see Hawaii videos anymore haha
[5/18/20, 12:23:48 PM] Lore: disfruta muucho del paseo en skate!! muuak 😘
[5/18/20, 12:31:16 PM] Joe: I’ll send you videos of boring California hahah. I’ll be back soon to send more though....or you can just come here 😂

[5/18/20, 12:39:38 PM] Lore: Me gustan estas cosas en la playa jaja
[5/18/20, 12:41:07 PM] Lore: No creo que sea aburrida jaja decidiré según las fotos cual me guste más y si el puto Trump me deja entrar jajajaj
[5/18/20, 12:41:33 PM] Lore: Disfrutaaa 🛹🌴
[5/18/20, 1:28:41 PM] Joe: Aaaah I just spent 25 minutes trying one trick hahaha.
[5/18/20, 1:28:53 PM] Joe: Didn’t get it 😞
‎[5/18/20, 1:45:29 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/18/20, 2:21:20 PM] Joe: Just letting you know I’m back from skating
[5/18/20, 2:35:33 PM] Lore: Ohhh hay "toma falsa", que intentabas hacer?

[5/18/20, 2:52:07 PM] Joe: Haha i was fine. Just frustrated cause I was close to landing it. And I thought it would be easy when I started trying it.
[5/18/20, 2:55:54 PM] Lore: jaja hoy no es un buen día para Joe, ni español ni skate
‎[5/18/20, 2:58:10 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 2:59:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I guess I’m a little off today

[5/18/20, 3:00:56 PM] Lore: jjjjj
[5/18/20, 3:01:38 PM] Lore: voy a empezar a apuntar notas también jaja
[5/18/20, 3:05:10 PM] Lore: I changed the SHEETS today, I had soiled them with avocado, one of the insignificant things, but what I like the most is the freshly cleaned sheets, the smell of softener
[5/18/20, 3:10:09 PM] Joe: Hahaha sheets 😂 

I feel it. Clean sheets are so fuckin great. Extra level of comfort when they’re freshly washed
‎[5/18/20, 3:11:45 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/18/20, 3:12:30 PM] Joe: Nelly and Carlos(we call him Boom Boom hahaha)
[5/18/20, 3:15:11 PM] Lore: jaja kion?
[5/18/20, 3:15:57 PM] Lore: eso se dice en Perú, en España es Jengibre
[5/18/20, 3:18:04 PM] Lore: jaja que divina, te manda todas las palabras
[5/18/20, 3:24:30 PM] Joe: Yeah she is really trying to make me learn. I knew she would be excited about it when she found out haha
[5/18/20, 3:26:55 PM] Joe: I’m trying to get this gif thing working today so I don’t feel like I failed at everything. 

It might end up being another thing to add to today’s list of failures though hahaha. Fuck. What a day
[5/18/20, 3:29:47 PM] Lore: Es genial, si hubieses aprendido español antes, no tendrías estos momentos de aprender con Nelly
[5/18/20, 3:30:12 PM] Lore: gif?
‎[5/18/20, 3:31:58 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/18/20, 3:34:36 PM] Lore: gif o caras como emociones, como skype.,más básicos

[5/18/20, 8:18:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha oooh I wish. I’m up earlier than you most times so I’d rub your head all morning if you want 😂 

Back to bed haha I’ll talk to you soon 😊
‎[5/18/20, 8:29:10 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 8:30:30 PM] Lore: Sería perfecto
[5/18/20, 8:31:24 PM] Lore: Además tuve una pesadilla por eso me desperté 😭
[5/18/20, 8:32:18 PM] Joe: Aw that sucks haha. I hope you have better dreams if you can get back to sleep 💤 🛏
‎[5/18/20, 10:55:00 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/18/20, 10:56:01 PM] Lore: Jaja m había quedado dormida
[5/18/20, 10:59:56 PM] Joe: Haha you don’t know how much I would love to rub your head in the mornings 😂

[5/18/20, 11:36:39 PM] Lore: Yaaa 😴

[5/18/20, 11:45:21 PM] Joe: I’m going to right this down to use later haha
[5/18/20, 11:45:43 PM] Lore: muy bieeen!!!!
[5/18/20, 11:50:00 PM] Lore: cual es la diferencia del primer video con el segundo? el rectángulo ahora es más grande no? y antes salia el link al elefgir el gif, ahora sale la imagen en pequeña
[5/18/20, 11:51:12 PM] Lore: pregunta: si te escribo por chat, y cierro, el mensaje se borra o podés verlo?
[5/18/20, 11:52:47 PM] Joe: I can still see it until I close the game on my end.
[5/18/20, 11:54:17 PM] Joe: Oh yeah making the little preview instead of the text showing up in the box took forever haha. Had to make the preview appear, then add a button to cancel if you don’t want to use the gif, and make sure if you choose another gif it replaces the current one and doesn’t add another preview
[5/18/20, 11:54:41 PM] Joe: It was a little complicated and frustrating but I got it. 1/3 today 😂
[5/18/20, 11:55:53 PM] Joe: Oh but if someone else joins they can’t see any chat that was written before they entered. Or if you rejoin, you won’t be able to see it. But it never gets deleted for anyone that stays in the game
[5/18/20, 11:57:39 PM] Lore: I went into our room, put a gif and played a game, you see that later then?
[5/19/20, 12:00:32 AM] Lore: cuando la gente normal, que no se dedica a esto, navega por un web, o juego, no es consciente del trabajo que hay detrás, jaja es todo desde cero.. bueno yo creo que aprendiste algo bueno hoy no?? para futuros trabajos te servirá
[5/19/20, 12:00:33 AM] Joe: No cause I’m not in the room now. So if I join i see a blank chat. And actually the room will be deleted when the last player is gone
[5/19/20, 12:01:02 AM] Lore: ahhhh, eso quería saber!!
[5/19/20, 12:02:25 AM] Joe: Yeah it’ll be another thing to tack onto the resumé so that’s good. Plus it’ll make playing way more fun 😂
[5/19/20, 12:02:46 AM] Joe: I sent a video to my friends, they were stoked on the new feature
[5/19/20, 12:03:32 AM] Joe: But yeah it’s kind of crazy to think about how everything we use on the internet had to be made in a similar way. Just a bunch of code
[5/19/20, 12:04:55 AM] Lore: jjjj hombrecito!!! pues entra en la habitación y vamos a probar esos nuevos gifs!!!
[5/19/20, 12:05:53 AM] Joe: Haha ok
[5/19/20, 12:06:09 AM] Lore: no??
[5/19/20, 12:06:20 AM] Joe: Let’s play
[5/19/20, 12:06:25 AM] Lore: despues del esfuerzoo, ahora a probarlo!
[5/19/20, 12:06:26 AM] Joe: I want to try it
‎[5/19/20, 12:14:52 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/19/20, 12:15:42 AM] Joe: Damn what happened? It’s stuck? Shit
[5/19/20, 12:15:56 AM] Joe: Hmmmmmm
[5/19/20, 12:16:12 AM] Lore: no hay "X" para cerrar la ventana
[5/19/20, 12:16:30 AM] Joe: You just click anywhere that is not the box
[5/19/20, 12:16:32 AM] Lore: no me deja cerrarla, tampoco con la letra escape, ni pinchando fuera
‎[5/19/20, 12:16:49 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/19/20, 12:17:32 AM] Lore: ah ahora si!
[5/19/20, 12:17:39 AM] Joe: Oh sweet
[5/19/20, 12:17:57 AM] Joe: I wonder why it didn’t work. I hope it doesn’t do that a lot to people haha
[5/19/20, 12:18:05 AM] Lore: jaja tranquilo, respiraaaaa
[5/19/20, 12:18:37 AM] Lore: no podés poner una x? o la opción que la persona de a la letra esc?
[5/19/20, 12:19:17 AM] Joe: I could probably do both. Alright...added to the list
[5/19/20, 12:20:16 AM] Lore: cuántos gif hay en esa página
[5/19/20, 12:20:27 AM] Lore: mi madre se vuelve loca, le encantan cada vez que se lo pongo
[5/19/20, 12:20:38 AM] Lore: y me pregunta, como lo conseguisteeee??? a mi no me salen tan buenos
[5/19/20, 12:21:11 AM] Lore: y ella, los busca en la conversación y los vuelve a reenviar a mi hermano, a mi... jajajaja
[5/19/20, 12:23:13 AM] Joe: I don’t know hahah. You have access to GIPHY’s whole library of gifs. Probably the same that this app uses.
[5/19/20, 12:23:31 AM] Joe: Facebook just bought GIPHY this week and the own WhatsApp
[5/19/20, 12:24:57 AM] Joe: Hahaha i wonder what kind of gifs your mom likes? 😂 

I always think about sending my mom a meme or gif but I rarely do
‎[5/19/20, 12:26:21 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/19/20, 12:28:35 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good. I need to teach my mom to use them. I’m interested to see what she would send.
‎[5/19/20, 12:29:50 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/19/20, 12:31:27 AM] Lore: jajajaja si, mi madre esta mejorando con el envio de gifs, aunque ella opta por reenviar los que yo mando a todo el mundo
[5/19/20, 12:36:56 AM] Joe: Hahahah “mister bean” “en google?” Hahaha
[5/19/20, 12:38:23 AM] Joe: You need to teach her how to find the hidden gems 💎 I’ve been getting good with the gifs from talking to you 😂
[5/19/20, 12:38:33 AM] Lore: Ella pregunta cómo tengo gif graciosos los suyos dice que son básicos y le expliqué que tiene que poner en el buscador de gif una palabra
[5/19/20, 12:38:38 AM] Lore: Y me dice dónde, en Google?
[5/19/20, 12:38:51 AM] Lore: 🙈🙈🙈
[5/19/20, 12:39:38 AM] Lore: Si, siempre elegiste muy buenos gif jajaja eso fue un punto a tu favor
‎[5/19/20, 12:40:37 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/19/20, 12:47:54 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good to know. I got points for the good gifs 😂 

I’m becoming fluent in the language of gif as a backup in case I can’t learn Spanish. All communication will be with gifs only haha
[5/19/20, 12:49:47 AM] Lore: Jajaja
‎[5/19/20, 12:50:36 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/19/20, 12:53:30 AM] Joe: Haha hair and pants are looking wild. I love it 😂
[5/19/20, 1:17:57 AM] Lore: Jajaj
[5/19/20, 1:18:04 AM] Lore: Eyy me estaba preparando el desayuno
[5/19/20, 1:18:20 AM] Joe: The skateboarding from earlier today wiped me out. I should’ve taken a nap.
‎[5/19/20, 1:18:22 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/19/20, 1:18:36 AM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if i pass out out of nowhere today haha
[5/19/20, 1:18:43 AM] Joe: Mmmm
[5/19/20, 1:19:34 AM] Lore: Jajaja si es mi pijama largo, y el pelo 🥴 un moño
[5/19/20, 1:21:53 AM] Joe: Haha I like the look very much. Nice and comfortable
[5/19/20, 1:22:05 AM] Lore: Jajaj bueno no te preocupes, descansa. Yo estoy desayunando y empiezo el curso en un rato!!! 🤓
[5/19/20, 1:22:35 AM] Lore: Gracias 🥰
[5/19/20, 1:25:23 AM] Joe: Haha alright. Well I guess I’ll lay down. I’ll probably fall asleep instantly, I can feel it coming haha.
[5/19/20, 1:26:31 AM] Joe: Have a good day, I hope the course goes well for you! 

I’ll talk you you later 😘
[5/19/20, 1:27:00 AM] Lore: Si te cuesta dormir, mira este vídeo
[5/19/20, 1:29:17 AM] Lore: https://youtu.be/knj9Atxscrc
[5/19/20, 1:29:51 AM] Lore: Autodidacta
[5/19/20, 1:30:18 AM] Joe: Haha cool I’ll put it on
[5/19/20, 1:30:56 AM] Joe: That’s me. But I’m not like super smart or anything hahah. Sounds cool. I’ll watch it
[5/19/20, 1:31:52 AM] Lore: Jaja sí ahí es una ruina en Estados Unidos la educación
[5/19/20, 1:32:02 AM] Lore: Acá no es tanto, ni mucho menos...
[5/19/20, 1:32:40 AM] Lore: Pero me gusta la manera de aprender, más práctica y efectiva que estar 4 años encerrado
[5/19/20, 1:35:23 AM] Joe: Same! I LOVE learning but college still was not the right choice for me and I’m glad i didn’t go. I would probably be in so much debt haha. Instead I have a nice little savings 👍
[5/19/20, 1:36:18 AM] Joe: So far it’s working out. I know a lot of people that went to college but aren’t using their degrees in the end. 

I’m happy with my decisions at the moment. Glad you’re on the same hype with taking your own path to learning
[5/19/20, 1:39:15 AM] Lore: Jaja te va a gustar entonces el video del chico
[5/19/20, 1:40:44 AM] Lore: Yo estudié en una escuela de arte, es pública, hice una prueba de acceso y la nota me dio para tener una plaza. Para interiores si necesito "titulación"
[5/19/20, 1:41:14 AM] Lore: Pero estoy en el mismo "hype" jaja no hace falta universidad no super títulos para aprender una cosa
[5/19/20, 1:42:03 AM] Joe: It only cost this dude $5,000 to stay in Argentina for 4 months. I should do that hahah
[5/19/20, 1:42:10 AM] Lore: Por ej. El título del curso del 3D no me valdría en absoluto, lo que vale son los resultados
[5/19/20, 1:43:03 AM] Lore: Como vos.. imagina un chico que paga por desarrollador web y luego no sabe cómo resolver los problemas de los códigos etc jaja, vos serías elegido por qué lo que importa es lo demostrable no el título
[5/19/20, 1:44:07 AM] Lore: bueno depende de la vida que te guste llevar .. pero se puede ajustar mucho más ese presupuesto
[5/19/20, 1:46:12 AM] Joe: Yeah web development has many self taught people. It’s all about what you can do, so portfolios and projects are important. 

Probably similar with the 3D modeling.
[5/19/20, 1:47:26 AM] Joe: Hmm well I’m pretty flexible on lifestyle haha I don’t need much. 

But I’ve been saving for a while so I’m ready to go on a trip like that 😂
‎[5/19/20, 1:47:51 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/19/20, 1:48:49 AM] Lore: Exacto! A mí se me ocurrió la idea de compartir el curso con Sandra. Jaja cómo es online, lo pagamos a medias, el título nos importa una mierda. Solo ver los vídeos juntas, etc
[5/19/20, 1:48:59 AM] Lore: Muy bieeeeen!
[5/19/20, 1:49:08 AM] Lore: Tendrás que pensar el destino! Jjjj
[5/19/20, 1:49:37 AM] Lore: Además si nunca viajaste fuera de USA vas a alucinar
[5/19/20, 1:50:59 AM] Joe: Hahah nice. That’s a good way to do it 😂
[5/19/20, 1:51:36 AM] Joe: I need to think about the destination? Cause I’m pretty sure it would just be wherever you are Hahahaha

[5/19/20, 11:32:16 AM] Joe: Hahaha 😊
[5/19/20, 11:32:44 AM] Joe: Alright I’ll talk to you after the class 😘
[5/19/20, 12:30:20 PM] Joe: Ok all done. Today the main thing I learned it the importance of the apostrophe haha.
[5/19/20, 12:31:32 PM] Joe: Nelly told me about her friend that would get mad because people would write “Feliz ano nuevo” on Facebook without using the “ñ” hahaha
[5/19/20, 1:34:03 PM] Lore: Eyyyy
[5/19/20, 1:34:19 PM] Lore: Fui a tomar unos mates

[5/19/20, 1:50:56 PM] Lore: Jajaja te creo, no ví ninguna foto en tu perfil, bueno hay una que tenés que me gusta mucho pero la tenés medio oculta jaja
[5/19/20, 1:51:18 PM] Lore: Pareces un hawaiano más jjj te falta el collar d flores
[5/19/20, 1:51:58 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t post any selfies haha. This one won’t be posted either most likely haha. Just one for you
[5/19/20, 1:52:48 PM] Lore: 🥰
[5/19/20, 1:52:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha there is a name for the dudes like me with the gold chain and stuff out here. I forgot what it was though
[5/19/20, 1:53:51 PM] Lore: Jajaja en España sería como gitano
[5/19/20, 1:57:33 PM] Joe: I’ll tell you what it is when I remember or I’ll ask my sister. I got this chain from Nelly probably 15 years ago. It has a pendant that is in the shape of Peru and says “PERU” across it. 

The part that holds it to the chain broke so I have to get that fixed
[5/19/20, 1:58:32 PM] Lore: Si me imaginé que sería algo d tu familia
[5/19/20, 1:58:46 PM] Lore: Los abuelos antes llevaban mucho oro, y en sudamérica es normal
[5/19/20, 1:59:13 PM] Lore: Me gusta como te queda y el significado
[5/19/20, 2:07:45 PM] Lore: Ay el audio no lo escucho bien, hay mucho ruido alrededor jaja
[5/19/20, 2:07:56 PM] Lore: Solo entendí feliz año nuevo
[5/19/20, 2:08:32 PM] Joe: Haha yeah she got it on a trip to Peru too so I really like it.
[5/19/20, 2:08:49 PM] Joe: I’m going to take a shower really quick and I’ll redo the audio 🚿
[5/19/20, 2:12:56 PM] Lore: Osea que chiquitito lo llevabas también el colgante? Quiero ver alguna foto tuya de chiquito, como como 5-8 años
[5/19/20, 2:14:59 PM] Lore: Disfruta de esa ducha jjj
[5/19/20, 2:41:16 PM] Joe: Haha all the pictures of me at that age are mostly me in sports uniforms. Like baseball and soccer. The baseball ones are funny cause I wore a helmet that made my head look huge 😂
[5/19/20, 2:43:26 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.

[5/19/20, 3:02:00 PM] Lore: Justo en un callejón, y luego por la noche pasa el camión de basura y los contenedores quedan vacíos
[5/19/20, 3:02:57 PM] Lore: Cuando lo ví fue como eh???😲 pinocho d verdad? Y paré a hacer una foto para mostrartelo jaja
[5/19/20, 3:09:48 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate you sending the picture. I think it’s really interesting that you came across that. Life is so strange sometimes. Beautifully strange.
[5/19/20, 3:13:15 PM] Joe: Oh and I’ll send pictures of mini Joe when I get back to California but you’ll have to send me mini Lore pictures in return 😂

[5/19/20, 3:36:57 PM] Joe: You’ll be disappointed with my pictures when I send them. I don’t think I have a lot of good ones. I’ll have to ask my parents to see if they’re hiding any.
[5/19/20, 3:38:38 PM] Lore: 🤔
[5/19/20, 3:38:48 PM] Joe: So, right now I’m using these things to try and hear words better....music you sent me, la casa de Papel, and I’m watching a bunch of “Casi Creativo” videos hahaha

[5/19/20, 4:45:48 PM] Joe: Haha that’s ok. No worries.
[5/19/20, 4:46:53 PM] Joe: Haha it’s an interesting genre. The “bad guy” that you end up on their side

[5/20/20, 3:20:10 PM] Lore: Yo puedo aceptar a algún gato como oni, y algunas gallinas!!
[5/20/20, 3:21:39 PM] Joe: Haha definitely chickens, maybe a goat, and dogs. From there it depends how much space I have. I also want to grow a lot of food
[5/20/20, 3:23:36 PM] Joe: But how many of everything depends on the space. I still need to save more before I can start on that but I’ve been working towards a life like that
[5/20/20, 3:23:43 PM] Lore: Jajaj si una cabra!!!

[5/20/20, 3:24:15 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
‎[5/20/20, 3:24:31 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/20/20, 3:24:40 PM] Joe: I want one haha
[5/20/20, 3:24:53 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja geniales
[5/20/20, 3:25:08 PM] Lore: Queremos la misma vida, vivamos juntos jajajaja
[5/20/20, 3:25:16 PM] Lore: Podemos hacer una rampa en el jardín para que puedas patinar
[5/20/20, 3:26:00 PM] Joe: Duuuuude stop hahaha I already want you 😂
[5/20/20, 3:26:49 PM] Joe: Aaaah I’m just kidding though. I just think it’s so strange how we want such similar lives
[5/20/20, 3:27:26 PM] Joe: And somehow you decided to talk to me from across the world even though I’m pretty difficult to talk to in the beginning
‎[5/20/20, 3:28:10 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/20/20, 3:28:31 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/20/20, 3:29:07 PM] Joe: I just don’t know what to think hahah. Is life really full of such serendipity?
[5/20/20, 3:29:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, te elegí sin saberlo
[5/20/20, 3:30:25 PM] Lore: Podría ser como con otro que hablé dos palabras por ser go diferent y luego dejamos de hablar
[5/20/20, 3:30:41 PM] Lore: Pero con vos no jajaja así que si, es raro pinocho y mucha casualidad
[5/20/20, 3:32:11 PM] Joe: Hmmm....
‎[5/20/20, 3:32:45 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/20/20, 3:34:12 PM] Joe: Haha I really don’t know what to think about it all sometimes 😂 

I guess I’ll just say it’s all a coincidence hahaha. Fuck. So weird
[5/20/20, 3:34:34 PM] Joe: Anyway, what kind of animals and how many would you want?
[5/20/20, 3:36:18 PM] Lore: No sé, pero querer ver a una persona que está en otro puto lado del mundo, me parece una locura y me encanta que pase, todo es una experiencia nueva y me gustan las cosas diferentes
[5/20/20, 3:36:47 PM] Lore: Me aburre tremendamente tener que estar como el resto, trabajar en una oficina, 8 horas, ir al cine, cenar, dormir, y trabajar.
[5/20/20, 3:37:10 PM] Lore: Aunque ahora lo tengo que hacer porque al final vivo en una ciudad pero no es mi plan de vida
[5/20/20, 3:38:44 PM] Joe: Stop being perfect hahaha

This is definitely me.
[5/20/20, 3:39:14 PM] Joe: Yeah I understand. You have to do what you have to do to get by. But you have the right goal haha
[5/20/20, 3:39:58 PM] Lore: Jajaja vamos a la par pinocho
[5/20/20, 3:42:09 PM] Lore: Mmmm me gustaría un buen jardín.. para tener... Unos 5 perros, 1 o 2 gatos( no suelen gustarme mucho los gatos, pero si están en compañía de otros animales me hacen gracia), algún gallo que me dé los buenos días y algunas gallinas huevos jaja, que estén sueltas con los perros por el césped
[5/20/20, 3:42:20 PM] Lore: Mmm creo que una cabrita también me encantaría
[5/20/20, 3:43:15 PM] Lore: Y ya luego hamacas paraguayas para poder estar mucho tiempo fuera descansando jaja
[5/20/20, 3:43:59 PM] Lore: Un huerto también, tomates, pepinos, alguna plantita de "maria"
[5/20/20, 3:44:18 PM] Lore: Jajaja basta 💭
[5/20/20, 3:45:19 PM] Lore: Y muuuuuchas plantas, en todos lados, fuera y dentro de la casa, incluso en el baño  jaja
[5/20/20, 3:48:06 PM] Joe: Those are some wonderful dreams. I know I’m just some random dude on the internet or whatever but I’d be really happy to work together to make that happen. Team work makes the dream work haha
[5/20/20, 3:50:31 PM] Joe: But like you said...enough 💭 hahaha it just sounds so nice though
[5/20/20, 3:50:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja ay ay ay.. aleatorio no.
[5/20/20, 3:51:01 PM] Lore: Y vos qué animales tendrías y que casa?
[5/20/20, 3:51:29 PM] Joe: I think it’s fair to admit I’m pretty random haha
[5/20/20, 3:52:59 PM] Joe: I mean my plan is basically what you described. Maybe I didn’t think it would be so many dogs and cats but “the more the merrier” as they say haha
[5/20/20, 3:53:15 PM] Joe: Small house. Lots of land. Animals and nature
[5/20/20, 3:53:55 PM] Lore: Que más?
[5/20/20, 3:54:29 PM] Lore: Jaja siempre pensé muchos, pero ahora mientras escribía puse número para imaginarlo de verdad al principio jaja
[5/20/20, 3:57:14 PM] Joe: Haha wellll I really want my small house to be cute and inconspicuous. Look like a very old style, made by hand, but on the inside it will be like a smart house hahah. And I want to grow mangoes 🥭 and avocados 🥑 possibly coffee if the location is right for it. I also want a garden full of variety. Basically anything I can make grow well in the climate my house ends up in. There is a big difference between being up higher and being near the shore in terms of climate.
[5/20/20, 3:57:39 PM] Joe: Most likely off grid with solar
[5/20/20, 3:57:58 PM] Joe: And a catchment for the water
[5/20/20, 3:59:11 PM] Joe: I’m trying to think of anything else 🤔
[5/20/20, 4:00:54 PM] Joe: I don’t know. Just a simple lifestyle I suppose. Not much too it but it will still take a lot of work.
[5/20/20, 4:02:33 PM] Lore: Mmm puedo vivir con vos?
[5/20/20, 4:02:35 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/20/20, 4:03:18 PM] Joe: That would complete the dream for me so yes you can haha
[5/20/20, 4:03:24 PM] Lore: No había pensado en los mangos y aguacates! Son de mis preferidos!
[5/20/20, 4:04:17 PM] Lore: Todos los alimentos que se puedan!
[5/20/20, 4:04:46 PM] Lore: En un clima tropical los frutos serían deliciosos
[5/20/20, 4:05:44 PM] Lore: Jaja sí el jardín es grande vos podés elegir algo para poder patinar y yo una mini piscina para poder meterme con los perros al agua jaja
[5/20/20, 4:07:01 PM] Joe: I better start saving more money 😂
[5/20/20, 4:07:13 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
‎[5/20/20, 4:07:46 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/20/20, 4:09:01 PM] Lore: Bueno al final creo que es re importante tener sueños y objetivos, saber lo que no queremos y lo que podría ser una vida como nos gusta. Lo bueno es que es sin lujos como una mansión o un piso en centro de una ciudad
[5/20/20, 4:09:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha you don’t understand. I’ve been imagining this for a long time. I actually have been putting money away to make this dream real for me. I’m not going to take no for an answer from the world on this one.
[5/20/20, 4:10:42 PM] Lore: 👏👏👏👏
[5/20/20, 4:12:10 PM] Lore: Lo conseguirás, se nota como hablas de ello al imaginarlo, serás un hippie en tu casa con todo tipo de frutas y verduras y animales de todo tipo 💙

[5/20/20, 4:49:17 PM] Joe: Hmm?
[5/20/20, 4:49:17 PM] Lore: Jajaja si totalmente!!
[5/20/20, 4:49:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha
‎[5/20/20, 4:49:40 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/20/20, 4:49:41 PM] Lore: 👆
[5/20/20, 4:49:58 PM] Joe: Oh boy haha
[5/20/20, 4:50:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja qué crees?
[5/20/20, 4:50:05 PM] Joe: For sure 😂
[5/20/20, 4:51:03 PM] Joe: I think you’re making me want to see you even more haha. Uuuugh this distance 😔
[5/20/20, 4:52:26 PM] Lore: Jajajaj mmm vos te tocaste algún día pensando en mí?
[5/20/20, 4:52:53 PM] Lore: ( no te pongas nervioso jajaja)
[5/20/20, 4:54:09 PM] Joe: Oh boy hahah
[5/20/20, 4:54:12 PM] Joe: Aaaah
[5/20/20, 4:54:27 PM] Lore: Jajaja o no sos una persona sexual?
[5/20/20, 4:54:33 PM] Joe: I have
[5/20/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: I am sort of haha. The same way I’m not talkative if you don’t know me, I’m not super sexual unless I really feel for you.
[5/20/20, 4:57:09 PM] Joe: Also I’ve never had to express my sexuality from a distance because I’ve never been in this situation
[5/20/20, 4:57:28 PM] Joe: No one has ever made me really have feelings for them from across the world haha
[5/20/20, 4:59:48 PM] Lore: Mmm
[5/20/20, 4:59:59 PM] Lore: Jaja creo que lo entiendo
[5/20/20, 5:02:54 PM] Joe: Hahah sorry if I’m disappointing you here. It’s just who I am though. If I was near you, you would be getting 100% of my affection. You’ve gotten a lot further than most 😂
[5/20/20, 5:03:40 PM] Lore: Jaja no pasa nadaaa era solo una pregunta!!!
[5/20/20, 5:03:47 PM] Lore: Tenía curiosidad
[5/20/20, 5:04:33 PM] Joe: Ok. What about you? I’m assuming you’re a little more of a sexual personality than me haha
[5/20/20, 5:05:35 PM] Joe: Mostly because I’m shy as fuck not because I think something about what you do hahaha

I’m just saying I feel like you have an easier time expressing it than me?
[5/20/20, 5:06:48 PM] Lore: Mm si soy espontánea e impulsiva, si me siento cómoda no tengo problema en decir cualquier cosa
[5/20/20, 5:08:00 PM] Lore: Pero después de estar hablando con vos tantosss días, te lo solté
[5/20/20, 5:09:14 PM] Lore: Soy sexual si, pasional mejor dicho.. no sé, tampoco me había tocado tener que expresar esto a un desconocido jaja
[5/20/20, 5:09:40 PM] Joe: Haha sorry about that. For you and any boys in Madrid that have their eye on you 😂
[5/20/20, 5:10:17 PM] Lore: Jaja qué sentís?
[5/20/20, 5:10:33 PM] Joe: I know what you mean. By this point I would usually have to just express through action haha
[5/20/20, 5:12:17 PM] Lore: Ya.. pero acción a 12.000km...
[5/20/20, 5:13:51 PM] Lore: Pero me gustaría poder hablar d ello como algo normal jaja, no sé
[5/20/20, 5:13:56 PM] Joe: Hmm yeah that’s unfortunate haha fuck
[5/20/20, 5:15:42 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s true. I’ll try to be as open, honest, and comfortable about it with you as I can be
[5/20/20, 5:17:15 PM] Lore: Eso sí, si sos asexual necesito saberlo jajaja
[5/20/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Not at all. I love sex hahahah but only with a certain person or I can’t even enjoy anything
[5/20/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: Definitely not asexual. Just.....really picky haha
[5/20/20, 5:21:23 PM] Lore: 🤷 obviamente no? Jaja quien se va a acostar con alguien que no quiera
[5/20/20, 5:22:26 PM] Lore: Jajaj si fuese de esta manera, no te diría que saques el pasaporte y vengas jajaja
[5/20/20, 5:25:21 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised. I mean, a lot of people can sleep with people they’re only physically attracted to, even if they don’t have much of a connection and enjoy it a lot. I can’t do that.
[5/20/20, 5:25:51 PM] Joe: Don’t worry. I would be all over you hahaha
[5/20/20, 5:27:14 PM] Lore: 😯 que bonito!
[5/20/20, 5:28:06 PM] Lore: Ya no sé que pensar jajaja pero espero que sí
[5/20/20, 5:31:47 PM] Joe: I really like you. I don’t know how to make that clear without seeming weird hahaha 

I like talking to you and hearing what you think about things. I enjoy your opinions on the world and I like the things you put value on in your life. Those are the things that attract me to people.
[5/20/20, 5:32:12 PM] Lore: https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVrAAJIyQ8/?igshid=1fo345zwifgju
[5/20/20, 5:32:57 PM] Joe: I would definitely be all over you. And I wouldn’t let you go. 

Seriously reconsider getting into anything with me unless you want to end up married 😂
[5/20/20, 5:34:59 PM] Lore: Jaja mierda cuando consigo que hables de tus sentimientos se me ocurre pasar un vídeo, jajaja de una ola asesina
[5/20/20, 5:35:47 PM] Joe: Haha it was a good video
[5/20/20, 5:36:43 PM] Lore: Que lindo lo que decís, muchas gracias! Siento lo mismo por vos ☺️
[5/20/20, 5:37:39 PM] Lore: Y esta la combinación perfecta jajaja aunque siempre critiqué los casamientos
[5/20/20, 5:39:23 PM] Joe: That’s fine. Don’t need to get married then, but you’ll end up with me for a long ass time haha
[5/20/20, 5:41:40 PM] Lore: Jajajaja al final me harás creerlo
[5/20/20, 5:41:46 PM] Joe: Ok I’m sorry to keep you up with my crazy dreams of being together hahaha 

maybe you should get some sleep so you’re ready for class tomorrow
[5/20/20, 5:42:37 PM] Joe: Good cause I’m going to make it happen so I don’t want you to be too surprised
[5/20/20, 5:43:26 PM] Lore: Jajaj todo bien, yo empecé... Poco a poco jajaja vos solo te dejaste llevar pero yo fui la culpable de la conversación en el momento que te dije que tenía ganas de verte, etc jajaja
[5/20/20, 5:44:23 PM] Joe: Haha you make me excited when you talk about seeing me, sorry 😂
[5/20/20, 5:44:34 PM] Joe: Ok well you get some sleep then
[5/20/20, 5:45:32 PM] Joe: I’ll talk to you tomorrow I’m sure haha
[5/20/20, 5:47:40 PM] Lore: Jajaja, te lo diré alguna vez más 🤗
[5/20/20, 5:48:28 PM] Lore: Jaja sí me voy a dormir, creo que mañana puedo enseñarte algo nuevo del cursooo!!!
[5/20/20, 5:49:09 PM] Joe: Ok sounds good. Looking forward to seeing it!
[5/20/20, 5:49:15 PM] Lore: Hoy Sandra empezó a trabajar y yo estuve toda la mañana y unas horas por la tarde, haciendo ejercicio sola

[5/22/20, 12:39:08 AM] Joe: Oh noooo! Haha that sucks. Too much pollen, not enough coffee. What’s next?
[5/22/20, 12:39:24 AM] Lore: 😂
[5/22/20, 12:40:42 AM] Joe: Haha my American accent. I don’t know if that’s good or not but thanks for saying my voice is sweet 😂 cause I hate it
‎[5/22/20, 12:41:12 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/22/20, 12:46:13 AM] Lore: Jajaja si, me gusta
[5/22/20, 12:47:55 AM] Lore: Si es bueno,a mí me hace gracia. Además te entiendo, y eso me gusta, porque significa que podremos comunicarnos cuando nos veamos
[5/22/20, 12:53:39 AM] Joe: You can understand my spanish or my English? Haha my spanish is so trash. 

But I was thinking I need a book. Cause I need to learn all the rules of the language.
[5/22/20, 12:55:14 AM] Joe: Like learning all the common rules for tenses and conjugations then work on the special cases that are slightly different. I don’t know. I just feel like I’m being inefficient with how I’m going about this and I could be learning faster

[5/22/20, 1:16:55 AM] Lore: Oki parece tu bebé jajaja no te deja hablar español
[5/22/20, 1:17:01 AM] Joe: It’s alright. My frustration will help me improve. Better to be frustrated with being mediocre than to be satisfied I guess 😂
[5/22/20, 1:18:02 AM] Joe: No he just wanted to talk back to me haha. He wants to learn too.
[5/22/20, 1:18:13 AM] Joe: He’s hella talkative though. Always making noise
[5/22/20, 1:18:20 AM] Lore: Jajaj pero te entiendo cuando lo pronuncias, no te frustres por eso
[5/22/20, 1:18:40 AM] Lore: Jajajaa
‎[5/22/20, 1:20:22 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/22/20, 1:22:00 AM] Joe: Haha maybe I just can’t imagine someone’s pronunciation being so bad that you couldn’t understand. I don’t know. 

It’s alright. I get frustrated with everything I try to learn. It’s a good sign. It shows me that I’m at the edge of my comfort zone and that’s where you learn the most
‎[5/22/20, 1:22:47 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/22/20, 1:23:48 AM] Lore: Exacto, estás aprendiendo! En cuanto a la pronunciación, hay gente que no se entiende nada, como el chino del vídeo jajajaja

[5/22/20, 1:31:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha shit
[5/22/20, 1:32:27 AM] Joe: Just at the beginning. Takes a few tries for me to get it.
[5/22/20, 1:33:21 AM] Joe: I’m going to stop using the word “purr” in English and only use ronronear until I got it down hahah

[5/22/20, 2:08:05 AM] Lore: Mañana y pasado ya no hago
[5/22/20, 2:08:54 AM] Lore: Es que el ejercicio de hoy es un asco... Hay que hacer un entorno urbano, farolas, papeleras, calles, barandillas

[5/22/20, 2:33:17 AM] Lore: porfiiiiiiii, esta lleno y me da problemas con el programa, vos sabés algo de esto?
[5/22/20, 2:34:08 AM] Joe: Haha yeah you need to delete things you don’t need or transfer them to cloud storage or an external hard drive.
[5/22/20, 2:34:50 AM] Joe: You can put things on Dropbox or something similar and delete them from your computer or buy something like a Samsung SSD and transfer things to that
[5/22/20, 2:35:08 AM] Lore: Es que solo tengo programas ahi, no tengo fotos ni nada
[5/22/20, 2:35:46 AM] Lore: "supuestamente" no puedo eliminar, porque no sé que son, la carpeta de windows con codigos y mierdas, pesa mucho
[5/22/20, 2:35:48 AM] Joe: Hmmmm
[5/22/20, 2:36:48 AM] Lore: si tengo dos discos ahi, el D y el E, donde tengo guardas algunas fotos y eso, pero mi problema es el puto C, que acumula muchas carpetas y no entiendo
[5/22/20, 2:38:49 AM] Lore: escucha descansa ahora que te ibas a dormir, cuando tengas un hueco mañana si podés me ayudas!!
‎[5/22/20, 2:40:33 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/22/20, 2:43:03 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll look at it more tomorrow. It might also be that you don’t have enough memory/RAM which is different than the long term storage in those drives. 

RAM has a big impact on how fast programs can run. Not having enough will make it run slow.
[5/22/20, 2:43:44 AM] Lore: mmmm
‎[5/22/20, 2:44:04 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/22/20, 2:44:38 AM] Lore: https://www.pccomponentes.com/msi-px60-6qd-042es-i7-6700hq-16gb-1tb-128-ssd-gtx950m-156

[5/22/20, 2:45:10 AM] Lore: esta es mi computadora
[5/22/20, 2:46:17 AM] Joe: Specs look pretty good. Hmm, it only is running slow when you use that 3d program?
[5/22/20, 2:47:13 AM] Lore: si, no esta mal... se usa para videojuegos
[5/22/20, 2:47:32 AM] Joe: Or all the time? If it’s only with that program, it’s probably just a super memory intensive program.
[5/22/20, 2:47:58 AM] Lore: si, solo con ese programa, se me cierra de golpe... o algunas funciones creo que le cuestan... pero lo más importante para mi, es que se me cierra sin avisarme y puedo perder algo en lo que llevo trabajando un rato
[5/22/20, 2:48:14 AM] Joe: I’m thinking that program is probably just insane with the amount of resources it needs. 3D rendering takes a lot of memory
[5/22/20, 2:48:47 AM] Lore: claro!
[5/22/20, 2:49:00 AM] Lore: y cual es la solución? liberar espacio?
[5/22/20, 2:50:03 AM] Joe: I have to see if that laptop allows for you to upgrade the ram but you can go from the 16GB you have to 32GB and that might help
[5/22/20, 2:51:06 AM] Lore: actualizar la tarjeta ram sería mejor que liberar espacio entonces?
‎[5/22/20, 2:52:09 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/22/20, 2:52:31 AM] Joe: Yeah because that space that’s full is the long term storage. But i think the problem is with the short term memory/RAM
[5/22/20, 2:53:19 AM] Joe: 30GB remaining right? Not 30GB RAM?
[5/22/20, 2:53:39 AM] Joe: A good way to check would be to open the task manager when you’re using the program and see what it says
‎[5/22/20, 2:54:34 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
‎[5/22/20, 2:54:48 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/22/20, 2:55:25 AM] Lore: esa carpeta > windows> ocupa 30 GB! yo no guardo nada ahi, son los programas y carpetas que se supone que son importantes.. pero no sé hasta que punto.. jaja son demasiados no?
[5/22/20, 2:56:34 AM] Joe: Well it might not look like it’s in there but If you have any photos and videos they’re usually on the C drive. Just hard to find.
[5/22/20, 2:57:54 AM] Joe: Open the task manager when you have the program open and see if you are using 100% of the memory. Also try not to have google chrome open while using the program cause chrome uses a lot of memory. Maybe try Firefox
[5/22/20, 2:57:58 AM] Lore: si? yo los guardé en el otro disco, todas las fotos y videos! en el disc D
[5/22/20, 2:58:44 AM] Lore: mientras uso el programa, tengo 6 páginas de chrome abiertas, spotify, skype, jajaja
[5/22/20, 2:59:28 AM] Joe: Hahaha Ok now I really think it’s the RAM 😂
[5/22/20, 2:59:33 AM] Lore: CONTROL+ ALT + ?
[5/22/20, 2:59:45 AM] Joe: Delete
[5/22/20, 2:59:54 AM] Lore: ayudame!!! jajaja
[5/22/20, 3:00:11 AM] Joe: Control + alt + delete then open task manager to check on memory usuage
[5/22/20, 3:00:20 AM] Joe: Usage*
[5/22/20, 3:01:39 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll help tomorrow. I’m going to have to actually read up and make sure you get the right stuff. But it’s most likely not enough memory haha
‎[5/22/20, 3:02:55 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/22/20, 3:03:08 AM] Lore: gracias bombón!!!
[5/22/20, 3:04:27 AM] Joe: Hmmm only 51% usage on your memory. Keep that open and if it starts going slow look at it and see if it is at or above 100%
‎[5/22/20, 3:04:53 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/22/20, 3:05:29 AM] Lore: okey, abierto mientras uso el programa entonces, lo haré.. luego te digo!

[5/22/20, 12:45:35 PM] Lore: O por ejemplo..."Respeta, (1persona- yo) para que te respeten" (3persona, ellos)... " Respeta, para que te respeten"
[5/22/20, 12:46:12 PM] Joe: Ok haha sounds good. There was some funny stuff today. Like “sordo” I learned because Boom Boom is supposedly deaf but he can hear Nelly from across the house when she says “food is ready” hahaha
[5/22/20, 12:47:02 PM] Joe: We were talking about it in context to a relationship. So one partner saying it to the other.
[5/22/20, 12:48:07 PM] Lore: cómo, boom boom?
[5/22/20, 12:48:32 PM] Joe: Mi abuelo
[5/22/20, 12:49:07 PM] Lore: conversación basada en hecho real? tuyo o d tu abuela?
[5/22/20, 12:49:22 PM] Lore: ellos son boom boom, algo me habías dicho desto, recuerdo
[5/22/20, 12:51:07 PM] Joe: Nelly was talking about her and BoomBoom. We were talking about how they joke around a lot but she has never been offended by him and he has never been offended by here. Because they respect each other.
[5/22/20, 12:51:21 PM] Joe: By her*
[5/22/20, 12:52:08 PM] Lore: mmm pero boom boom le dice tu abuela a tu abuelo, o ellos dos son boom boom?
[5/22/20, 12:53:13 PM] Lore: Que lindo, se puede bromear y no faltar el respeto claro, así deberían ser todas las relaciones
[5/22/20, 12:53:14 PM] Joe: Haha boom boom es mi abuelo, Nelly es mi abuela.
[5/22/20, 12:53:40 PM] Lore: jaja si ya sé que Nelly es tu abuela
[5/22/20, 12:53:51 PM] Lore: pero boom boom, por que le dicen a tu abuelo así?
[5/22/20, 12:55:07 PM] Joe: Oooh like why do I call him that? I don’t know haha. That’s what everyone in our family had always called him. 

Him and my dad are both named Carlos so maybe to differentiate was the initial reason but I don’t know to be honest
[5/22/20, 12:56:18 PM] Lore: ahhhhh jaja
[5/22/20, 12:56:47 PM] Lore: bueno, a ver... audio explicandome que aprendiste
[5/22/20, 12:59:14 PM] Joe: Hahaha shit

[5/22/20, 1:10:34 PM] Lore: Sordo/ Zurdo
[5/22/20, 1:14:24 PM] Joe: Damn I tried to find a good “thanks teacher” gif. I got nothing hahaha
[5/22/20, 1:14:51 PM] Joe: So I guess I just say, thank you for the tips like a normal human hahaha
[5/22/20, 1:16:43 PM] Lore: jaja de nada, entendiste lo que te dije o te lo escribo?
[5/22/20, 1:29:31 PM] Joe: Hahaha siii. Sordo is like BoomBoom. Can’t hear. But zudro is like me, left-handed haha
[5/22/20, 1:34:25 PM] Lore: Boom boom, es sordo de verdad?  o es en broma lo de sordo?
[5/22/20, 1:35:09 PM] Lore: Sos zurdo como mi hermano, yo soy diestra (derecha)
[5/22/20, 1:36:07 PM] Joe: I’m not sure hahah. Doctor says he can’t hear. And he supposedly doesn’t hear or mishears things often. But Nelly was saying she’ll tell him “food is ready” in a normal voice,  not even yelling, and he will come from across the house 😂
[5/22/20, 1:36:14 PM] Joe: So she said he is faking it hahaha
[5/22/20, 1:36:51 PM] Lore: ahhhh jajaja

[5/22/20, 1:37:14 PM] Lore: "Boom bom es sordo para lo que quiere"
[5/22/20, 1:37:27 PM] Lore: para lo que a el le interesa, jajaja
[5/22/20, 1:37:40 PM] Joe: Haha me and Gastón living as left handed people in a right handed world 😂
[5/22/20, 1:37:58 PM] Lore: 🤣
[5/22/20, 1:38:40 PM] Lore: exacto!!! jajaja
[5/22/20, 1:38:50 PM] Joe: Sí, audiencia selectiva jaja
[5/22/20, 1:39:30 PM] Lore: ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´
[5/22/20, 1:39:33 PM] Lore: áh mierda
[5/22/20, 1:39:51 PM] Lore: jajaj se escribió eso sin querer, estaba escribiendo con mano izquierda, jajajajaa terrible!!!!!!!!
[5/22/20, 1:39:59 PM] Joe: I wonder if he had the problem of smearing everything he wrote when he was younger too haha. I used to hate that. After writing an essay my hand would be covered in ink 😂 hated it
[5/22/20, 1:41:20 PM] Joe: Haha even with the left hand....how? Hahahaha
[5/22/20, 1:41:47 PM] Lore: jajaja no sé, estaba aburrida y dije quiero probarlo jajaja

[5/22/20, 1:51:27 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll have to try writing to you right handed. I’m leaving to drive to the north side of the island in a second though so I’ll send that later. Going to a beach
[5/22/20, 1:53:20 PM] Lore: Jajajaj me acabo de sentir como una niña pequeña, no podía agarrar bien el bolígrafo jajaja
[5/22/20, 1:53:45 PM] Lore: Ay qué bien!!! Disfruta mucho!!!! 🌴Un besooo

[5/23/20, 3:11:14 AM] Lore: que bonito lugaaar Joe! me encanta!
[5/23/20, 3:11:44 AM] Lore: Quiero bañarme ahi en esa playa turquesa jaja
[5/23/20, 3:32:25 AM] Joe: Haha yeah. Long day got me tired
[5/23/20, 3:33:54 AM] Joe: It was super nice today. I wish to could’ve been here 😔
[5/23/20, 3:48:40 AM] Lore: Me alegro que te lo hayas pasado bien! 🤗
[5/23/20, 4:16:49 AM] Joe: What are you dooooing today?
[5/23/20, 4:18:07 AM] Lore: Hoy hice una entrevista a una chica por que se queda libe una habitación
[5/23/20, 4:18:37 AM] Lore: ahora mismo, somos 3 ( Sandra, Nuria y yo) Nuria, es la loca.. jaja se va por suerte!!
[5/23/20, 4:20:22 AM] Lore: y vino una chica interesada, y parecía muy simpática, 39 años, buena vibra, trabajadora, le gusta la naturaleza también como a nosotras, los animales, yoga, la cerveza, jaja asi que me dio buenas impresiones! jpero aun no sabemos si se quedará, aunque a ella le encantó la luz de la casa y ubicación
[5/23/20, 4:28:46 AM] Joe: Ooh so interviewing for another roommate? That’s cool. I hope you find someone chill haha
[5/23/20, 4:30:59 AM] Joe: I shouldn’t have slept for so long. I messed up haha.


I saw myself in the mirror a second ago and my hair is all wild and curly 😆 salt water makes my shit curl up hella much. I’m going to miss going in the ocean all the time when I leave
[5/23/20, 4:33:04 AM] Lore: Si, veremos quién se mete, también había otro chico interesado, pero me da mejor vibra esta chica, ya te contaré que decidimos!
[5/23/20, 4:34:13 AM] Lore: jajaja a mi me pasó el día que me tomé la puta pastilla de la alergia, te acordás? jajaja pero igual como tus horarios son tan raros, jaja quizá te entre sueño en un rato jajaja
[5/23/20, 4:36:19 AM] Lore: ah si??? jajaja a ver 👀
[5/23/20, 4:37:38 AM] Joe: Hahah alright sounds good
[5/23/20, 4:38:03 AM] Joe: Yeah probably I’ll fall asleep again soon. Or...hopefully haha
‎[5/23/20, 4:39:50 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/23/20, 4:40:12 AM] Joe: Weird little pigtail looking curls hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:42:38 AM] Joe: Kind of makes me wonder how long my hair would be if it was straight. It feels like it’s barely getting longer cause it just gets curlier haha
[5/23/20, 4:43:16 AM] Lore: jajajaja
[5/23/20, 4:43:25 AM] Lore: muy gracioso ese rulo, parece un resorte
‎[5/23/20, 4:45:05 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 4:45:28 AM] Lore: liso no, me gustan esos rulos!!!! te queda bien así el pelo mmmm jajaa
[5/23/20, 4:48:39 AM] Joe: Hahaha it just bounces back when I pull it. It’s so weird 😆 

I used to have short hair forever. Only grew my hair out in the last couple of years but I feel like my hair likes being in Hawaii 😂
‎[5/23/20, 4:50:09 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 4:50:17 AM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:50:29 AM] Joe: Nice. Ok I go back to sleep now hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:50:52 AM] Lore: 🙄
[5/23/20, 4:50:57 AM] Lore: Jajaj okey
‎[5/23/20, 4:52:45 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 4:53:40 AM] Lore: te queda lindo el pelo largo, jaja yo si tengo un hijo en algun momento... si es chico le voy a dejar el pelo largo jajaje
[5/23/20, 4:56:39 AM] Joe: Alright you got me. Now I need to ask since you brought it up haha

What would you like when it comes to having children?
[5/23/20, 5:00:32 AM] Lore: jajaja no te ibas a dormir?
[5/23/20, 5:01:03 AM] Lore: mmm que me gustaría?
[5/23/20, 5:02:00 AM] Joe: Well I was going to go to sleep but now I’m interested to know about this haha
[5/23/20, 5:02:23 AM] Lore: vamos allá, jaja me gustaría tener varios... hijo unico no, me gusta eso de tener hermanos... yo solo tengo uno, pero me hubiese gustado tener dos más por ejemplo, jajaja..
[5/23/20, 5:05:12 AM] Joe: Hmm ok. Yeah some brothers would be pretty cool haha
[5/23/20, 5:05:12 AM] Lore: en cuanto al sexo, espero que esto no suene raro... pero no sé me gustaría que el primero que tenga, sea varón....
‎[5/23/20, 5:05:38 AM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/23/20, 5:06:43 AM] Lore: y luego no sé, odio todo el tema este de la sobreprotección, me gustaría criar a mis hijos en contacto con la naturaleza, con respeto de los animales... que sepa hacer varias cosas, no tanto como en la escuela, y compartir viajes.. no sé si me explico
[5/23/20, 5:06:48 AM] Joe: That’s cool. I’d be super stoked on a boy too, that would be the best. But I would be really happy either way
[5/23/20, 5:07:52 AM] Joe: Yeah you’re explaining fine. That sounds very nice
[5/23/20, 5:10:07 AM] Lore: mmm jaja si hizo mal la traducción. Yo solo tengo un hermano, (Gastón), por eso me gustaría tener más. Y por otro lado, no tendría un hijo solo, desde mi punto de vista, tienen un cariño extra de los padres, no saben lo que es compartir, y poder jugar con otros hermanos, eso puede afectar en sus futuras relaciones, vínculos con la sociedad
[5/23/20, 5:10:44 AM] Lore: * Se hizo mal la traducción
[5/23/20, 5:15:44 AM] Lore: jaja mierda, sigo pensando en ello, jajaja estas preguntas me hacen pensar cosas más internas
[5/23/20, 5:16:46 AM] Joe: Haha don’t worry. Tell me more. Tell me anything you think of
[5/23/20, 5:17:16 AM] Joe: Yeah this makes sense. I see where you’re coming from. I like the idea of siblings also
[5/23/20, 5:17:49 AM] Lore: pero si, que aprendan a hacer cosas de la casa por ejemplo, cosas útiles, no solo jugar con muñecos jaja, que todos aprendan a coser, cocinar, plantar un tomate por ejemplo.... jajaja  y viajar.... en una furgoneta o autocaravana... hacer acampadas, NO a hoteles y playas llenas de gente...
‎[5/23/20, 5:19:33 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:19:51 AM] Joe: Seriously though this sounds really great. I like what you want
[5/23/20, 5:20:37 AM] Lore: Pequeña Miss Sunshine
[5/23/20, 5:21:22 AM] Lore: Gracias 😚, y vos que??? te gustaría?y si es así.. cómo?
[5/23/20, 5:23:32 AM] Joe: Hmm🤔 

I always imagined having multiple children. Like 2 or 3.
[5/23/20, 5:24:48 AM] Joe: I don’t know exactly how I want to raise my children. But as long as they are loved and happy and they have what they need, I’ll be happy.
[5/23/20, 5:25:53 AM] Joe: What you described is definitely more of my style though. Camping and stuff instead of hotels and all that.
[5/23/20, 5:27:05 AM] Lore: 3 es perfecto
[5/23/20, 5:27:53 AM] Lore: siii, lindo! peeeero jaja eso es muy general, no me das algunos detalles
[5/23/20, 5:29:16 AM] Lore: bien!!! es que me da una pereza, esas familias que se van de vacaciones, pagan un hotel, sus niños juegan un poco con tanta gente alrededor y vuelven a sus casas...
[5/23/20, 5:30:06 AM] Joe: I never imagined many details. I don’t know...I think it’s because I don’t want to completely control the lives of my children hahah so I don’t want to make up stories in my mind about what they should or shouldn’t be.

But when I see them find interest in positive things I just want to guide them and help them figure out who they are
‎[5/23/20, 5:34:24 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:35:24 AM] Lore: mmm.. parece que me estas diciendo que yo quiera controlar sus vidas...
[5/23/20, 5:36:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha no not at all
[5/23/20, 5:36:33 AM] Lore: yo te di "detalles", de lo que creo que sería una buena educación, respecto a lo convencional... obviamente intentaría ver sus cualidades para que hagan lo que más les guste y sean felices
[5/23/20, 5:36:40 AM] Joe: Sorry I didn’t mean it that way
[5/23/20, 5:37:51 AM] Joe: No for sure. I know what you’re saying. What you described didn’t sound controlling or anything like that. Some people have the “detail” down to the smallest thing.
[5/23/20, 5:39:32 AM] Joe: Damn...I really didn’t mean to come off like that and I’m really sorry. What you describe sounds like it would give your children more freedom than the average and I really really like that
‎[5/23/20, 5:40:21 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:42:14 AM] Lore: jaja no pasa nada, podemos pensar de maneras diferentes en algunas cosas jaja, solo que me chocó verlo así, pensé que me decías a mi controlador, jamás haría eso, de hecho las cosas que pienso, son las que me gustaría para que puedan tener más libertad en la vida
[5/23/20, 5:45:19 AM] Joe: Yeah I thought it sounded like a very “free” lifestyle. It’s one that I’m super into hahaha

I don’t know. I just want to help my kids turn into cool little dudes 😂
‎[5/23/20, 5:46:18 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:47:03 AM] Lore: jajajaja
[5/23/20, 5:50:08 AM] Lore: y una última cosa jajaja, no sé como serán ahi los padres... pero en esta sociedad, muchas veces los hombres quedan en un segundo plano con sus hijos, las madres parece que lo hacen todo "mejor" únicas e irreemplazables. No estoy para nada de acuerdo con ello, un hijo es de dos, me gustaría que el padre de mi hijo, pueda tener un contacto tan cercano, como el de una mujer.. no sé como.. jaja estaría genial que tenga pechos y pueda tener el también ese vinculo, jaja esto no lo pensé mucho...
[5/23/20, 5:51:10 AM] Lore: pero es que con lo que te conté, del hermano de Sandra... es super buen hombre, y lo esta pasando muy muy mal, la mujer nunca dejaba que el tome decisiones, y ahora lo aleja de su hijo... todo tiene que ser como ella dice, eso lo detesto!!!
[5/23/20, 5:51:42 AM] Lore: ( mierda, ahora si me pasé jajaja, pero tenía que decirlo)
‎[5/23/20, 5:52:49 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:54:48 AM] Joe: I would do everything I could to be 50/50 with you.

I definitely want to be a big part in my childrens lives. Not just hand them off to the mother haha.
[5/23/20, 5:58:34 AM] Joe: Also my dad was not a very affectionate guy haha. He would be the one to take me to do sports and all that but he was definitely one to fall in the background a bit. He worked hard though and I recognize that. 

But I would like to show my children more affection. I can barely give my dad a hug without him being all weird about it
[5/23/20, 6:05:20 AM] Lore: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
[5/23/20, 6:11:04 AM] Lore: Me gusta saber estas cosas, pasa mucho, todas las personas somos diferentes, yo tengo amigas que no tienen contacto con sus abuelas, para mi, mis 3 abuelos, fueron suuuper cariñosos conmigo siempre, yo ahora puedo ser más cariñosa con mi abuela, que con mis padres jaja

[5/23/20, 6:15:30 AM] Joe: 😊
[5/23/20, 6:16:53 AM] Joe: I really appreciate that haha cause I really want to be a good dad. I had the weirdest moment working at summer camp last year when I was helping some kid and I thought to myself, “damn I should be a dad or something” haha
[5/23/20, 6:18:06 AM] Joe: I’m trying to teach my own kid how to skate...not everyone else’s hahaha
[5/23/20, 6:19:06 AM] Lore: jajaja eso es típico, si tenés una hijo no jugaría al futbol, patinaría .. o una hija, lo mismo! jaja
[5/23/20, 6:21:22 AM] Lore: bueno, jajaja si tuviese que elegir.. serías una buena elección para ser el padre de mis hijos... jaja además podíamos tener la casita con jardín de la que hablamos, y toda la manada de animales jajaja
[5/23/20, 6:21:43 AM] Lore: Que bonito lo que te acabo de decir eeeeeh, eh jajaja!
[5/23/20, 6:23:50 AM] Joe: That does sound nice and I was not expecting you to say that haha
[5/23/20, 6:25:12 AM] Joe: But thank you 😊 you seem like you’d be a great mom. I would definitely be stoked if you were my kids mom
[5/23/20, 6:28:03 AM] Joe: Ok now I think I can go to sleep hahaha. i enjoyed our talk. Some good information here 😂

[5/23/20, 6:29:19 AM] Lore: jajaja gracias, lo bueno es que puede saber dos idiomas seguro! jajaja

[5/23/20, 12:56:14 PM] Lore: Good morning!!!
[5/23/20, 1:14:10 PM] Joe: And good evening to you haha. 

So I was wondering, are there any new updates on opening up over there?
[5/23/20, 1:30:40 PM] Lore: Estaba con Luchi que vino a mi casa y dimos un paseo, hace re linda noche acá! Me encanta estar con ropa cómoda y ligero con esta temperatura jaja
[5/23/20, 1:32:10 PM] Lore: Apertura de que?
[5/23/20, 1:32:44 PM] Lore: Por corona virus?
[5/23/20, 1:33:09 PM] Joe: Glad it’s a nice night. Enjoy it!
‎[5/23/20, 1:33:44 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 1:33:53 PM] Joe: Yeah. There is just so much arguing and confusion in the US right now I was just wondering what kind of updates people are getting in other places
‎[5/23/20, 1:34:26 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 1:36:58 PM] Joe: Hmm ok that sounds reasonable I guess. Everyone here is so divided here it’s hard to come up with a consensus for what we should do. Feels really weird.
[5/23/20, 1:37:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah that runny nose 🤧 must be hellllllaaaa pollen out there
‎[5/23/20, 1:39:14 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 1:41:23 PM] Lore: Si hay mucha confusión, todo se decide a último momento. Toda esta mierda va con fases y se divide por provincias. Madrid es una de las más afectadas, por tanto... Pasamos de fase muy lento. Nos costó 2 meses llevar a fase 1. Se supone que ahora podemos salir sin horario, ya empezaron a abrir muchas tiendas, peluquerías, restaurantes con aforo
‎[5/23/20, 1:42:35 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/23/20, 1:42:56 PM] Lore: Toda esa gente compra pizza o cerveza y lo toma en el banco en la calle jajajaja
[5/23/20, 1:43:20 PM] Lore: El lunes la situación cambiará, todo se hace de manera desescalada
‎[5/23/20, 1:44:30 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/23/20, 1:47:24 PM] Joe: Hahahah damn the whole world is a fucking mess 😂 this shit is so weird. Aaaah can’t wait for it to be over
‎[5/23/20, 1:50:35 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/23/20, 1:52:26 PM] Joe: So many people. I’m not looking forward to going back to the Bay Area haha. Too many humans everywhere! Fuck

[5/23/20, 2:19:22 PM] Lore: Quédate en Hawaii!
[5/23/20, 2:20:03 PM] Lore: El surfcamp se suspende?
[5/23/20, 2:26:05 PM] Joe: I wish I could stay. I need to go back though. At least for a few months. Skate camp didn’t get cancelled and I need to film for my video part. 

I’m just feeling a little weird about it though. I just need to stay focused for those few months and try to save up some more money.
[5/23/20, 2:27:25 PM] Joe: I’m getting nervous though cause I’m having a hard time finding a place to stay but I already have my ticket back. Shiiiiiit
[5/23/20, 2:35:00 PM] Lore: Ohhhhh
[5/23/20, 2:36:51 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno, está bien volver si tenés trabajo
[5/23/20, 2:36:56 PM] Lore: Volver a patinar con tus amigos
[5/23/20, 2:37:09 PM] Joe: Yeah I was going to stay with my friend but he rented out his extra room a couple weeks back. Now I’m trying to find something
[5/23/20, 2:37:11 PM] Lore: Hacer tu parte del vídeo!!!
[5/23/20, 2:37:57 PM] Lore: El lugar te referís al alquiler d casa?
[5/23/20, 2:38:15 PM] Lore: Ah perdón no había leído eso de arriba
[5/23/20, 2:38:40 PM] Lore: Pero que estás buscando, casa o habitación?
[5/23/20, 2:39:57 PM] Joe: I just need a room to rent. But I’m not trying to pay crazy high rent or there is no point cause all the money I make will just go to rent. I’m trying to save up over the summer.
[5/23/20, 2:41:36 PM] Joe: I was going to stay with a friend but they had to rent out their extra room cause they lost hours at work and needed money for rent now. They couldn’t wait until when I get back. 

I don’t know. I’m just hoping I find something reasonable.
[5/23/20, 2:44:01 PM] Lore: Claro, es que una casa entera para una persona si intentas ahorrar es una opción que hay que descartar!
[5/23/20, 2:44:28 PM] Lore: Cuánto cuesta una habitación o una casa aprox en la zona donde querés vivir?
[5/23/20, 2:45:48 PM] Lore: Acá en Madrid habitación de 350 a 450 euros y una casa de 3 habitaciones, unos 900- 1.000eu
[5/23/20, 2:47:34 PM] Joe: Hahahaha whaaaaat!? I should just go to Madrid instead. Renting a single bedroom in a house will most likely be $900-$1200 for me in the Bay Area. A house would be $2000-$4000 😂
[5/23/20, 2:48:10 PM] Lore: Quee????
[5/23/20, 2:48:13 PM] Lore: No puede ser
‎[5/23/20, 2:48:35 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 2:49:01 PM] Lore: 900 dólares una habitación, pero están locos de la cabeza jajaja
[5/23/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Yes. The Bay Area is absolutely insane with housing prices. It’s completely fucked.
[5/23/20, 2:49:20 PM] Lore: Una zona super pija
‎[5/23/20, 2:49:38 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 2:49:54 PM] Lore: Pero entonces entiendo que el sueldo ahí es más alto
[5/23/20, 2:49:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/23/20, 2:51:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you can find some really high paying jobs there. My job is kind of in the middle of the pay rate though so I definitely struggle a little when I’m in the Bay Area but that’s true for a lot of people living there. So many big tech companies brought in a bunch of high paid software engineers and they made housing crazy expensive
[5/23/20, 2:52:21 PM] Joe: That’s why I need a good deal on my housing to make it worth it haha.
[5/23/20, 2:53:22 PM] Joe: Damn I can’t believe the housing prices out there. I wonder what it would cost to actually buy a property?

I could live in Madrid in a house by myself for a year or two with just my savings hahaha
‎[5/23/20, 2:53:48 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 2:54:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[5/23/20, 2:54:53 PM] Lore: Me parece una locura, acá en Madrid mucha gente lucha también para vivir sola, es muy difícil. De hecho en España la gente se independiza súper tarde o tiene que compartir.. si quiere vivir alguien solo en Madrid, tiene que tener un buen sueldo, olvidate de ahorrar
‎[5/23/20, 2:55:46 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Yeah I think that’s the trend all over the world. People needed to stay with roommates or family for way longer than in the past
[5/23/20, 2:56:17 PM] Lore: Mmmm comprar? Depende la zona...
[5/23/20, 2:56:33 PM] Lore: 200.000 / 300.000 eu
[5/23/20, 2:56:47 PM] Lore: Es que depende de la ubicación, estado de la casa, etc
‎[5/23/20, 2:56:49 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 2:57:02 PM] Lore: Jajajajajaja
[5/23/20, 2:57:30 PM] Lore: Que divino el pajarito
[5/23/20, 2:59:01 PM] Joe: Lol I guess I should think about leaving the US maybe. If I can keep saving at this rate I should be able to buy something cool in another country haha. But I’ll probably never be able to afford the Bay Area unless there is a housing crisis like the one in 2007/2008
[5/23/20, 3:01:10 PM] Lore: Mmmm si
[5/23/20, 3:01:22 PM] Lore: Es que me parece exagerado
[5/23/20, 3:01:51 PM] Lore: Aunque claro si los salarios son altos... Pero tu trabajo lo bueno es que puede ser desde casa, podrías ganar sueldo de usa y vivir en otro país super bien jajaja
[5/23/20, 3:02:45 PM] Lore: A mí me gustaría Indonesia o Sri Lanka es super barato para vivir jajaja
[5/23/20, 3:03:02 PM] Joe: Haha unless I end up with a rich wife it’s pretty reasonable thing to think. Go on Zillow or similar real estate website and look at prices near Oakland/San Francisco/Berkeley. Shits crazy
[5/23/20, 3:05:40 PM] Lore: Jajaja mejor no depender de ninguna esposa rica
[5/23/20, 3:05:43 PM] Joe: Hmmm maybe I’ll need to start thinking about places like this haha. I need to figure this shit out. I know the Bay Area is not my final destination
[5/23/20, 3:06:18 PM] Lore: Y en Hawaii cuánto cuesta?
[5/23/20, 3:06:22 PM] Joe: Oh I’m not counting on that hahaha. I’m just saying, I can’t afford shit as a single dude in the bay
[5/23/20, 3:07:11 PM] Lore: Jajaj sisiisi, ningún "mortal" con un sueldo promedio es calidad de vida que viva en un sitio tan caro
[5/23/20, 3:07:12 PM] Joe: If you stay really close to town and near the beach it could be similar to the Bay Area but if you find a place a little further out from people you can get good deals still
[5/23/20, 3:07:39 PM] Lore: Tu hermana cuánto paga por su casa?
[5/23/20, 3:07:53 PM] Lore: 2habitaciones y jardín no?
[5/23/20, 3:10:53 PM] Joe: This place is like an apartment. 2 bedrooms and it has a little back patio area where we grow stuff. It’s about $1200/month but she has been living here for a while and kept her rate. If you move in today rent would be higher.
[5/23/20, 3:11:51 PM] Lore: Ah bueno, 1200 dólares no está mal tampoco
[5/23/20, 3:12:22 PM] Lore: 1,100 eu
[5/23/20, 3:13:02 PM] Joe: Yeah she has a good deal here. She’s not leaving any time soon hahah
[5/23/20, 3:14:02 PM] Lore: Si si, muy bueno
[5/23/20, 3:15:08 PM] Lore: Ahora en tu zona quizá hay más alquileres disponibles? En Madrid hay más libres porqué mucha gente se fue a otras casas más alejadas o a sus países
[5/23/20, 3:15:25 PM] Lore: Sin embargo se están llenando rápidamente, hay muchos casos de separaciones y divorcios jajajaja
[5/23/20, 3:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn that’s a strange reason for housing to be filling up 😂 

People couldn’t stand being locked in a house together
‎[5/23/20, 3:18:11 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 3:23:03 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck
‎[5/23/20, 3:25:39 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 3:26:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja en China también pasó
[5/23/20, 3:27:13 PM] Lore: Ahora en España
[5/23/20, 3:31:17 PM] Joe: Probably happening here too I would imagine. Aaaah everything is so weird right now. Never would’ve imagined all this one year ago
[5/23/20, 3:31:26 PM] Lore: Cuando tenés el vuelo a Cali? Cuántas horas de diferencia tenemos nosotros desde ahí?
[5/23/20, 3:32:37 PM] Joe: My flight is on June 8. I have to do a 3 hour layover on another island before flying back into Oakland.
[5/23/20, 3:32:57 PM] Joe: California is 3 hours ahead of Hawaii
[5/23/20, 3:34:13 PM] Lore: Viajero! Jjj
[5/23/20, 3:34:50 PM] Joe: I still can’t believe we’ve talked as much as we have with a 12 hour time difference haha it’s been fun though
[5/23/20, 3:35:33 PM] Lore: Mmm tendré que acostumbrarme a ese nueva diferencia horaria...si seguís hablando conmigo! ( Espero que si jaja) 🐻
[5/23/20, 3:36:34 PM] Lore: Síii jaja, mi horario por las noches algunos días se fue de control jajajaja
[5/23/20, 3:36:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha I can almost guarantee you’ll be the one who stops talking to me first 😂
[5/23/20, 3:37:44 PM] Joe: 😂 yeah it did! You surprised me a few times with how late you stayed up talking to me. I felt bad haha
[5/23/20, 3:37:55 PM] Lore: Por qué??? Jaja
[5/23/20, 3:38:53 PM] Lore: Jajaja era sin darme cuenta, miraba el reloj y de repente eran las 3 de la mañana, increíble jajaj creo que es lo máximo que salgo por la noche cuando voy a tomar unas cervezas jajaja
[5/23/20, 3:40:05 PM] Joe: I don’t know. You’ll probably just get tired of me talking about my nerd shit hahaha
[5/23/20, 3:40:54 PM] Lore: Mmmm
[5/23/20, 3:43:00 PM] Lore: Llevamos hablando como 1 mes y pico.. muchas horas, todos los días, vos que crees?  Jajaja
[5/23/20, 3:44:55 PM] Joe: Haha ok I guess maybe you find some entertainment in my crap. I feel like I talk to much about me I don’t get to hear enough about you. Which is weird cause i don’t like telling people about me haha
[5/23/20, 3:45:35 PM] Joe: I guess I just need to ask more questions if there is anything I want to know though. You’ve been pretty open about everything I ask so far
[5/23/20, 3:51:16 PM] Lore: Jjj hablamos los dos, depende del día uno más que el otro... Jaja me alegro que me cuentes cosas que al resto no... Yo disfruto aprendiendo más cosas d vos y te interesas por las mías, así que es una buena relación
[5/23/20, 3:51:52 PM] Lore: Si, jaja todo lo que me preguntas te lo respondo lo más sincera posible ... Aunque me digas controladora jajaja 😬
[5/23/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Haha alright good. If you ever don’t want to hear about something I’m telling you feel free to use that phrase I taught you, “shut the fuck up Joe” 😂
[5/23/20, 3:54:44 PM] Joe: Hahahah duuuude 😂 😂
‎[5/23/20, 3:55:20 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 3:58:42 PM] Lore: Jajaja okey, la usaré cuando lo crea necesario ☝️
[5/23/20, 3:58:59 PM] Lore: 😈😇
[5/23/20, 4:03:12 PM] Joe: Can’t wait for the first time you actually use it. It’ll quickly become one of your most used phrases when talking to me haha
[5/23/20, 4:05:18 PM] Lore: Jajaja nooo
[5/23/20, 4:06:02 PM] Lore: Me tenés que enseñar más frases, más cosas!
[5/23/20, 4:08:43 PM] Joe: Haha I never come up with good phrases to teach. I’ll think about it and try to send some good ones but if there is a particular topic you need phrases for that could help me narrow it down
[5/23/20, 4:08:58 PM] Joe: Analysis paralysis when deciding what phrases to tell you hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:10:06 PM] Lore: Sé creativo, o simplemente algo que quieras que te diga
[5/23/20, 4:11:51 PM] Lore: Ya les hablé a dos amigas de la parálisis de análisis y finalmente les tuve que enviar el vídeo jajaja 🙊
[5/23/20, 4:12:34 PM] Lore: Me tenés que decir frases, o palabras, incluso música... Siempre te envío yo 😒
[5/23/20, 4:19:30 PM] Joe: Hahahah I’m struggling so much coming up with good stuff. I need a topic there is just too much to choose from
[5/23/20, 4:20:59 PM] Joe: Here is a song while you wait for me to come up with something good. Random phrases are hard to think of. 

https://youtu.be/D--ZSSFMsIg
[5/23/20, 4:22:23 PM] Lore: Jaja tendrás que elegir algo, lo dicen en el video. Elijas lo que elijas, finalmente acabarás decepcionado jajaja
[5/23/20, 4:23:16 PM] Lore: Ah el otro día la escuché esta, me gusta mucho!
[5/23/20, 4:26:10 PM] Joe: It came on the radio when I was leaving the beach yesterday. “I wish you were here with me, on a beach in Hawaii”
[5/23/20, 4:26:11 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[5/23/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: Ok that made me think of a phrase. “That song slaps” or “that shit was slappin’”

Means like, the music is good
[5/23/20, 4:27:49 PM] Joe: Oh and, “this shit smackin” is when food is hella good hahaha. I’ll just teach you Bay Area slang 😂
‎[5/23/20, 4:28:51 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/23/20, 4:30:24 PM] Joe: Damn now I need to think of some other good bay slang. People say some funny shit out there
[5/23/20, 4:32:16 PM] Joe: Oh you should say, “this song hella slaps” that would be straight out of Oakland haha
[5/23/20, 4:33:33 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/23/20, 4:33:38 PM] Lore: Mmmm
[5/23/20, 4:34:13 PM] Lore: Expresiones raras, cuando lo puse en el traductor fue como 🧐
[5/23/20, 4:35:58 PM] Joe: Yeah those are very specific slang that doesn’t mean anything in a translator Haha
‎[5/23/20, 4:36:47 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 4:36:48 PM] Joe: But they’re used often in the bay. But if you go somewhere else people might look at you crazy and not know what you’re talking about haha
[5/23/20, 4:36:57 PM] Lore: No sé si estoy diciendo sábana
[5/23/20, 4:37:27 PM] Lore: Hella como se dice así? Jaja
[5/23/20, 4:37:49 PM] Lore: Haciendo el ridículo si llego a ir algún día a bahía
‎[5/23/20, 4:39:13 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 4:39:32 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/23/20, 4:39:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m realizing I could talk slang to you and you would have no idea what I’m talking about
[5/23/20, 4:40:34 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[5/23/20, 4:40:38 PM] Joe: Sometimes people will put an “sh” sound on smackin’. Like “shamackin”
[5/23/20, 4:40:53 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was shmackin” hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:41:15 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was hella shmackin” hahah I’m going to send you audio of that
‎[5/23/20, 4:41:27 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
‎[5/23/20, 4:42:03 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 4:42:14 PM] Joe: Threw a “yo” at the end but it doesn’t mean anything hahaha. “Yo” is a weird slang word that’s hard to describe.
[5/23/20, 4:43:02 PM] Lore: Jajaj okey necesito escuchar los audios otra vez
[5/23/20, 4:43:12 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry people only talk this way in specific neighborhoods. It’s not like the whole bay talks like that. It’s less and less common as locals move out of the bay
[5/23/20, 4:44:31 PM] Joe: The rich software engineers that move to the bay from across the country definitely don’t talk that way haha.
[5/23/20, 4:45:04 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/23/20, 4:46:02 PM] Lore: Fuiejdhfksnsjd
[5/23/20, 4:46:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha send me a bad audio clip I don’t mind. It doesn’t need to be perfect.
‎[5/23/20, 4:46:38 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 4:46:52 PM] Lore: Es como si tuviese una patata en la boca
[5/23/20, 4:47:10 PM] Joe: Say it like “that shit was slappen”
[5/23/20, 4:47:29 PM] Lore: Slaaaapin
[5/23/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: I bet if you say it like it has “en” at the end it’ll sound perfect
[5/23/20, 4:47:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha siiiiii
[5/23/20, 4:48:03 PM] Joe: Hella slappin yo
[5/23/20, 4:48:25 PM] Joe: That sentence makes zero sense outside of slang hahaha
[5/23/20, 4:49:38 PM] Joe: You’re going to speak English like you grew up in the hood
‎[5/23/20, 4:50:21 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted

[5/23/20, 4:53:12 PM] Joe: The difference from the first audio to the last is quite a big difference haha. Nice
[5/23/20, 4:53:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah ronronear boludo
[5/23/20, 4:54:16 PM] Lore: Jajajaj necesitaba decir un insulto pero no, me descargué con ronronear jajajaj
[5/23/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha best way to relieve the frustration with a ronronear 😂

[5/23/20, 5:00:24 PM] Joe: Hahahaha with the voice though 😂
[5/23/20, 5:01:56 PM] Joe: Haha pretty good. You can leave off the “yo” and it’s the same shit. Or you could throw it at the beginning instead like “yooooo that was hella shmackin” 😂
[5/23/20, 5:02:35 PM] Joe: It’s so funny to try to explain slang that I’ve heard and never really questioned whether or not it made sense. Cause it doesn’t make sense hahah
[5/23/20, 5:03:35 PM] Joe: Maybe because when you eat really loud that sound can be called “smacking” sometimes. Who knows 🤷‍♂️
[5/23/20, 5:04:39 PM] Joe: Haha I want you to say this to me if I make you a good breakfast. Please hahaha
‎[5/23/20, 5:05:07 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/23/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: Yeessss like that. Say that to me when I make you something good 😂
[5/23/20, 5:05:56 PM] Lore: Intentaré hacerlo, jaja lo apunto en mi cuaderno d notas para cuando te vea y me hagas unas tortitas
[5/23/20, 5:06:50 PM] Lore: Que tipo de cosas buenas? Sirve para todo? Jaja
[5/23/20, 5:06:54 PM] Joe: Haha not the most useful phrase but I’ll enjoy hearing it
[5/23/20, 5:07:31 PM] Joe: Mostly used for good foods.
[5/23/20, 5:08:16 PM] Joe: It can be used for other stuff but it’s harder to contextualize. Like you could say a house party was smackin
[5/23/20, 5:08:33 PM] Lore: Jajaj claro, si te gusta la usaré encantada aunque la diga mal
[5/23/20, 5:09:00 PM] Lore: Jaja okey solo comida mejor
[5/23/20, 5:10:09 PM] Joe: That’s the safest bet haha. Damn it’s going to be sooo long before you can say that to me in person haha fuck

[5/23/20, 5:27:03 PM] Lore: Mmm no sé, es una mierda no poder salir del país. A vos te darán pasaporte en algún momento?
[5/23/20, 5:28:13 PM] Lore: Jaja suena bien ese plan juntos en otro país, mientras pase esta mierda
[5/23/20, 5:28:58 PM] Joe: Of course. I was planning on doing it in California but maybe I should just see if I can do it online out here haha
[5/23/20, 5:30:34 PM] Joe: Honestly i would love to do it I’m not even joking
‎[5/23/20, 5:31:46 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 5:33:27 PM] Joe: You know but seriously, it would probably take 2 months to get a passport and id need to get a ticket so it could be 3, maybe 4 total. I think if we’re still talking at that time we should really talk about what the plan should be. Unless you just want to talk to me from far away forever haha I hope that’s not the case
[5/23/20, 5:34:38 PM] Joe: I mean, we should plan sooner rather than later but I’m just saying....I’m willing to take a chance and go anywhere, do anything, and just spend some time with you
[5/23/20, 5:35:05 PM] Joe: Cause it sounds like fun and it would make for a good story no matter what happens in the end haha
[5/23/20, 5:36:18 PM] Lore: Yooo Hella good, hella sweet!
[5/23/20, 5:37:13 PM] Lore: Jajaja perdón
[5/23/20, 5:37:50 PM] Lore: En realidad tengo pensado solo hablar contigo...
[5/23/20, 5:38:14 PM] Lore: Jaja mentira es broma, me pongo nerviosa ...
[5/23/20, 5:38:36 PM] Lore: En realidad yo también tengo ganas de verte, muchas
[5/23/20, 5:39:47 PM] Joe: Haha fooled me for a second.
[5/23/20, 5:40:04 PM] Joe: I understand the nervous joke. I’m all about the nervous joke hahah that’s my shit
[5/23/20, 5:40:44 PM] Lore: Es como muy muy raro, porqué no te conozco en persona pero me gustas, y tendría confianza por ejemplo a darte un abrazo o sonreirte jaja siento como si fueses alguien que ya conozco
[5/23/20, 5:41:18 PM] Lore: Pero no hablamos mismo idioma 🤯!
[5/23/20, 5:41:54 PM] Joe: Hey I’m getting better fast ok. I still have 3-4 months to improve haha
[5/23/20, 5:41:54 PM] Lore: Pero a pesar de todo, puedo plantearme verte, hablo más horas con vos ahora mismo que con otra persona, incluso más que con mis amigas 🙊
[5/23/20, 5:43:01 PM] Lore: 💚 sos lo más!
[5/23/20, 5:45:37 PM] Joe: Haha ok I understand. I don’t really know what to say so I’m just going to say nothing at all 😂
[5/23/20, 5:46:36 PM] Lore: Qué, qué??
[5/23/20, 5:46:46 PM] Lore: No bromas! Jajaja
[5/23/20, 5:49:01 PM] Lore: Tengo un deseo! Quiero que me grabes un video diciéndome lo que me dijiste antes, quiero escucharlo jajaja así lo reproduciré cuando tenga ganas de verte... Porfiiii 🙏
[5/23/20, 5:49:26 PM] Joe: Haha ok we’ll see how you feel in another month.

I don’t know. It seems like it could be a pretty sweet adventure.
[5/23/20, 5:49:52 PM] Joe: Haha which one?
[5/23/20, 5:50:29 PM] Lore: Quiero hacerlo!!! Si ahora dejase de hablar con vos estaría 🥺 jajaja
[5/23/20, 5:51:15 PM] Lore: Jaja lo de vernos que lo decís en serio, viaje, etc
[5/23/20, 5:52:59 PM] Lore: Me gusta verte, y como no te tengo ahora... Te voy a hacer que pases un poquito de vergüenza ( o no) repitiendome eso por video
[5/23/20, 5:53:47 PM] Joe: Hahahah alright shiiiit
[5/23/20, 5:53:55 PM] Joe: Oh god

[5/23/20, 6:02:17 PM] Joe: Not a great video hahah but I took it for you. Now if it would just send
[5/23/20, 6:05:40 PM] Joe: Sorry I don’t know why it took so long to send. But you’ll have something to watch in the morning. I totally ruined the video haha.

Buenas noches 😘
[5/23/20, 6:07:33 PM] Lore: Jajaja no me puedo concentrar con la música del fondo

[5/23/20, 6:08:20 PM] Lore: Me da miedo jajaja
[5/23/20, 6:08:26 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/23/20, 6:08:56 PM] Joe: I’ll make one with less scary music and original thoughts another time.
[5/23/20, 6:11:31 PM] Lore: Jajajja
[5/23/20, 6:11:52 PM] Lore: Gracias por grabarlo influencer de YouTube!
[5/23/20, 6:11:57 PM] Joe: Feel free to send videos to me anytime in return haha

[5/23/20, 6:17:20 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s a good one. I definitely did not expect that.

[5/23/20, 6:22:29 PM] Lore: Te acordarás cuando tengas tiempo que me tenés que ayudar con la tarjeta gráfica? El otro día no pude casi usar el 3d, las letras de los comandos tardaban en salir  😭
[5/23/20, 6:22:49 PM] Lore: Jajaja como no...
[5/23/20, 6:23:08 PM] Lore: Jajajaja cada vez que abras un aguacate podrido te acordarás
[5/23/20, 6:23:31 PM] Joe: Hmm yeah I can help. Did you see if your memory was maxed out when it was going slow?
[5/23/20, 6:23:37 PM] Lore: *teclas, no letras
[5/23/20, 6:24:25 PM] Lore: No.. se quedaba en un 40% aprox pero como tampoco funcionaba bien.. al final lo terminé cerrando
[5/23/20, 6:25:43 PM] Joe: 🤔 I’m not really sure what is making it go so slow to the point if crashing if it’s not the memory.
‎[5/23/20, 6:26:18 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 6:27:26 PM] Lore: Bueno cuando tengas un ratito, con el ordenador delante me decís que tengo que hacer 🙏
[5/23/20, 6:27:27 PM] Joe: I wonder if you could upgrade your graphics card? Or use an external GPU?
[5/23/20, 6:27:53 PM] Lore: Ni idea jajaja
[5/23/20, 6:28:06 PM] Lore: No externa no
[5/23/20, 6:28:11 PM] Joe: Ok. I’m trying to get an idea of the requirements for the program.
[5/23/20, 6:28:11 PM] Lore: Lo que viene en el ordenador
[5/23/20, 6:28:30 PM] Lore: https://www.pccomponentes.com/msi-px60-6qd-042es-i7-6700hq-16gb-1tb-128-ssd-gtx950m-156
[5/23/20, 6:29:12 PM] Lore: Ese es el modelo, tal cual está así lo compré
[5/23/20, 6:29:45 PM] Lore: Puedo actualizar la tarjeta y averiguar y liberar espacio del disco C. Así con esas dos cosas igual funciona mejor?
[5/23/20, 6:31:11 PM] Joe: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/I don’t know if you can find the support page in spanish but they have some solutions for when the program is running slow. support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-5704C695-6270-4273-B178-88DA8E26689D-htm.html

[5/23/20, 6:31:25 PM] Joe: Crap
[5/23/20, 6:32:03 PM] Joe: I was saying I’m not sure if you can get this support page in spanish but it has some functions you can run to help it run faster
[5/23/20, 6:32:33 PM] Lore: Mmm mañana cuando me despierte, mientras desayuno miraré esto! Y probare
‎[5/23/20, 6:33:06 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/23/20, 6:33:29 PM] Joe: Let me know if it works. It looks like there is some good stuff for different situations
[5/23/20, 6:34:17 PM] Joe: Haha I love it. Half the battle is learning how to get really good at using google.

Most of web development is knowing what to google hahaha
[5/23/20, 6:34:25 PM] Lore: Okey en mi mañana te hablo( es decir, en unas horas jaja)
[5/23/20, 6:35:04 PM] Joe: Aaaah oh no I did it again hahah. Go to sleep! It’s so late there
[5/23/20, 6:36:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja 🤓👨🏻‍💻
[5/23/20, 6:36:48 PM] Lore: Si hoy me dormí una buena siesta por la alergia, pero ahora ya me entró sueño
[5/23/20, 6:37:41 PM] Lore: Jaja vida de cuarentena sin responsabilidades aún no pasa nada jajaja
[5/23/20, 6:38:08 PM] Joe: Haha oh yeah I guess that’s true. No much to do anyway
[5/23/20, 6:38:10 PM] Lore: Gracias por el video pinocho, un besoo 😘
[5/23/20, 6:39:06 PM] Joe: Yo no soy pinocho 😂 

Buenas noches 😘
[5/23/20, 6:40:32 PM] Lore: Jajaja okiii, un beso melenitas con rulos! 😘

[5/24/20, 1:48:04 AM] Lore: otra vez siesta fuera de hora 🙈
[5/24/20, 1:51:11 AM] Joe: Aaaah I couldn’t help it. I was so tired. I fell asleep so early like a damn grandpa 👴🏽

[5/24/20, 1:56:33 AM] Lore: jajajaja abuelo metido en el cuerp de un chico de 30
[5/24/20, 1:56:51 AM] Lore: jajaja quiero a todos esos perritos!
[5/24/20, 1:59:01 AM] Lore: mi amiga Luchi, viene a vivir a mi casa 1 mes, no esta bien con su novio... y viene con Rogel!!!
[5/24/20, 2:00:55 AM] Joe: Hahah niiiiice!
[5/24/20, 2:03:11 AM] Joe: Is that who is taking that open spot you were interviewing for? At least for the next month then?
‎[5/24/20, 2:03:33 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/24/20, 2:11:34 AM] Lore: Nooo, Luchi es mi amiga!!!
[5/24/20, 2:11:49 AM] Lore: La dueña de Rogel ( el perro) jaja
[5/24/20, 2:12:23 AM] Joe: Oh I know it’s your friend and dog. I was just wondering if they’re taking that spot or staying with you like, in addition to looking for that other person haha
[5/24/20, 2:12:24 AM] Lore: me encantan los abuelos bailarines! principalmente este jaja
[5/24/20, 2:13:06 AM] Lore: Tenemos 3 habitaciones en la casa, Luchi viene solo un mes, y luego vuelve con su novio jaja
[5/24/20, 2:13:26 AM] Lore: ibamos a buscar a una persona fija, pero como ella es mi amiga, la ayudaré a que pueda estar un mes en nuestra casa
[5/24/20, 2:14:22 AM] Lore: aunque hay malas noticias, la chica que vino ayer a hacer la entrevista, nos gustó, pero ella encontró una habitación con baño privado! aunque fue super simpatica, me mando un audio, agradeciendo, y diciendo que le hubiese gustado mucho venir por la buena energía
[5/24/20, 2:14:25 AM] Joe: Aah ok. Makes sense
[5/24/20, 2:15:29 AM] Joe: Oh that’s unfortunate. I guess they had no choice once they found a place with a private bathroom though. That’s always really nice to have haha
[5/24/20, 2:16:09 AM] Lore: Si, yo le dije que me alegraba por ella, que yo hubiese tomado la misma decisión!
[5/24/20, 2:18:00 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrTPy6H6oqI
[5/24/20, 2:18:16 AM] Lore: estoy enamorada de el, jajaja
[5/24/20, 2:21:37 AM] Joe: Hahaha the old man is killing it 😂
[5/24/20, 2:21:48 AM] Joe: The full video is hella good hahah
[5/24/20, 2:23:26 AM] Joe: Hahahaha when he starts dancing with 2 ladies at once 😂 😂 😂
[5/24/20, 2:24:06 AM] Lore: jajaja si, pero mi momento preferido sin duda es cuando tira las muletas al aire, y se agarra el pelo
[5/24/20, 2:24:50 AM] Lore: 0.06 😍
[5/24/20, 2:26:18 AM] Lore: jajajaja el sabe como llamar la atención de ellas!
[5/24/20, 2:27:25 AM] Joe: Hahah yeah that part is hella good too. Old man is a pretty cool dude
[5/24/20, 2:27:38 AM] Joe: Big time ladies man
[5/24/20, 2:28:57 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd55PWEp9hM&t=51s
[5/24/20, 2:31:15 AM] Lore: I would be screaming and cheering a lot! Hahaha
[5/24/20, 2:33:26 AM] Joe: Haha I like your energy. I would sit there and clap along quietly while you make all the noise and cheer 😆
[5/24/20, 2:33:54 AM] Joe: Damn....these old people can really dance haha
[5/24/20, 2:36:15 AM] Lore: JAJAJAJA
[5/24/20, 2:40:39 AM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvA2RNci3SE
[5/24/20, 2:41:03 AM] Lore: Youtube tiene tantos videos, que me atrapa

[5/24/20, 2:44:50 AM] Joe: I wish YouTube had more competition but it’s cool for now haha
[5/24/20, 2:47:23 AM] Lore: jajaja si me pasa lo mismo!
[5/24/20, 2:47:41 AM] Lore: es verdad, no tiene competencia...
[5/24/20, 2:48:53 AM] Lore: mierda, me encantan los musicos callejeros
[5/24/20, 2:51:36 AM] Joe: Haha street music is cool. I wish there was more of that out here. I feel like I don’t see it very often. Maybe a dude playing a ukulele once in a while
[5/24/20, 3:03:49 AM] Lore: Joe, cual sería?
‎[5/24/20, 3:04:10 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 3:05:09 AM] Joe: Nvidia
[5/24/20, 3:05:22 AM] Lore: 💙
[5/24/20, 3:05:50 AM] Joe: What did you find out?
[5/24/20, 3:06:24 AM] Lore: Nada aun, jaja voy a actualizar tarjeta gráfica por las dudas
[5/24/20, 3:06:53 AM] Lore: como puedo ver ese cambio? antes de actualizar y despues de actualizar? hay alguna ventana que pueda decirme si realmente hizo cambio?
[5/24/20, 3:06:59 AM] Joe: Oh oook
[5/24/20, 3:07:34 AM] Lore: me refiero a valores, números, que me digan si cambia algo o no jaja
[5/24/20, 3:09:41 AM] Joe: Open start menu
[5/24/20, 3:10:04 AM] Joe: Click or type the “run” command
[5/24/20, 3:10:35 AM] Joe: Then type “dgdiag”, without the quotes, and click ok
‎[5/24/20, 3:13:18 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 3:13:30 AM] Joe: Lame
[5/24/20, 3:14:02 AM] Joe: Worked for me. But it’s ok. Another way
[5/24/20, 3:14:35 AM] Lore: no importa, lo actualizo
[5/24/20, 3:14:49 AM] Lore: es que cuando hago cosas, me gusta ver si algo cambia para ver si lo hice bien o realmente sirvió
‎[5/24/20, 3:16:04 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/24/20, 3:17:28 AM] Joe: Oh it’s ok I found an easy way. Device manager -> display adapters -> nvidia -> driver
[5/24/20, 3:17:44 AM] Lore: perfecto
[5/24/20, 3:17:59 AM] Lore: voy a probar
‎[5/24/20, 3:19:16 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 3:20:35 AM] Joe: Yup that’s it. “Versión del controlador”
‎[5/24/20, 3:20:58 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 3:21:17 AM] Lore: le dí a actualizar, y es el mismo controlador, no hizo cambio entonces?
[5/24/20, 3:21:27 AM] Lore: así se actualiza la tarjeta gráfica?
[5/24/20, 3:22:22 AM] Joe: Doesn’t look like it but that might be the latest version. One second
[5/24/20, 3:24:13 AM] Joe: GeForce.com/drivers
[5/24/20, 3:25:03 AM] Joe: But a lot of their is a warning that says backup your system before updating the card
[5/24/20, 3:25:20 AM] Joe: But their is a warning*
‎[5/24/20, 3:25:28 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 3:25:30 AM] Joe: There* fuck I’m tired haha
[5/24/20, 3:26:10 AM] Lore: jaja, no te preocupes!!!
[5/24/20, 3:26:18 AM] Lore: anda a dormir, hablamos en otro momento!!!
[5/24/20, 3:26:39 AM] Lore: miraré algún video y lo averiguaré!
[5/24/20, 3:26:43 AM] Joe: Haha I’m not going to fall asleep though. I’m just drowsy. My nap was too long to fall asleep right now
[5/24/20, 3:26:43 AM] Lore: Buenas nochesss!!!
[5/24/20, 3:27:04 AM] Lore: 😘😘😘
[5/24/20, 3:27:25 AM] Joe: But....I would say you should try to do the things that the 3dsmax website suggested
[5/24/20, 3:29:48 AM] Joe: The docs for 3dsmax have a whole thing about performance issues and possible fixes.

 http://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/index.html?url=files/GUID-5704C695-6270-4273-B178-88DA8E26689D.htm,topicNumber=d30e597570
[5/24/20, 3:37:18 AM] Lore: 👍🏻 gracias!
‎[5/24/20, 3:41:47 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/24/20, 11:34:57 AM] Joe: Hola! Any luck with getting your program to not run hella slow?

I found a free spanish course online so I’m starting that today haha
[5/24/20, 11:46:12 AM] Lore: Buenos días!
[5/24/20, 11:47:10 AM] Lore: Lo único que hice fue actualizar la tarjeta gráfica, y borrar archivos (temp) jaja por que luego estuve ocupada montando esto...
‎[5/24/20, 11:47:28 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/24/20, 11:51:44 AM] Lore: jajaja ventilador!!! yo siempre viví en zona de montaña, y acá en el centro de la ciudad hace demasiado calooooor, asi que llevo pegada a el toda la tarde jajaja
[5/24/20, 11:51:44 AM] Lore: Ah si? como se llama? yo empecé con Bassu ayer, te lo iba a decir.. que te lo hagas, es para español también! si te interesa luego te paso un link
[5/24/20, 11:53:49 AM] Joe: Bahahah 😂
[5/24/20, 11:55:25 AM] Joe: Uuuh definitely interested. Pass me the link! Mine is just “basic spanish” on this website EDX. https://www.edx.org
[5/24/20, 11:57:13 AM] Lore: tiene buena pinta!
‎[5/24/20, 11:57:41 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 11:58:50 AM] Joe: Yeah EDX is a big website. I’ve taken other courses on it for programming. You can take courses from places like Harvard for free on that site
[5/24/20, 12:00:08 PM] Joe: But I’ll still check out busuu. The more content the better. Let’s me see the same thing explained in different ways
[5/24/20, 12:01:34 PM] Lore: Me gusta esto de los cursos, siempre tengo alguna página! una que igual te gustaría, aunque es de pago.. pero muy poco.. Domestika
[5/24/20, 12:02:13 PM] Joe: Edx.org/schools-partners
[5/24/20, 12:02:29 PM] Lore: Esto es básico, quería ver como era la app.. pero sin embargo hace pequeñas explicaciones al final de pronunciación y entonación, y eso si me pareció interesante..
[5/24/20, 12:02:38 PM] Joe: You can take a lot of the courses for free on EDX but you don’t get a certificate
[5/24/20, 12:03:08 PM] Lore: el certificado no importa
[5/24/20, 12:04:26 PM] Lore: https://www.domestika.org/es/courses/category/9-tecnologia
[5/24/20, 12:06:37 PM] Joe: Truuueee. I’ve never paid for any of the courses from EDX. I just need the knowledge not the paper haha
[5/24/20, 12:08:27 PM] Joe: Sweet. I’ll check this out. I would like to have my own courses online eventually. I don’t even know what I’d teach haha but it’d be cool to share something I know and make a few bucks doing it.
[5/24/20, 12:17:55 PM] Lore: jajajaj como te gusta la cámara eh amiguito!
[5/24/20, 12:18:52 PM] Lore: Podrías empezar a hacerlo,me parece perfecto... siempre hay gente interesada en aprender cosas a través de internet
[5/24/20, 12:20:56 PM] Joe: Hahah I had to practice to get comfortable with a camera. I actually really don’t like it 😂 

But it’s a great way to communicate with a larger audience on the internet nowadays. Have to take advantage of it while you can
[5/24/20, 12:24:04 PM] Lore: si haces algo aunque sea de tu profesión,  te apoyaré, pondré los subtitulos y daré visualizaciones jaja
[5/24/20, 12:24:57 PM] Lore: lo próximo si queremos ganar unos dolares/euros, sería hacer unos videos pronunciando español/inglés, como la rubia tonta... jajaja nos haríamos de oro!
[5/24/20, 12:26:12 PM] Joe: Damn...I really appreciate that. You’re the best
[5/24/20, 12:27:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’d be hella good. Making YouTube videos is pretty fun. I was started to make a few bucks off of them from my skateboard channel before they changed the rules hahah. I should get back on that and get that passive income flowing
[5/24/20, 12:28:54 PM] Joe: The only thing is you have to make a video almost everyday or your channel doesn’t get much traction. It’s really not that hard to get it going though if you can come up with some decent content and you’re active in an online community like a forum or something related to the topic of your channel
[5/24/20, 12:31:43 PM] Lore: ❤️
[5/24/20, 12:33:31 PM] Lore: mmm no estoy muy puesta en eso, sé que todo tiene una posición y bueno con palabras se puede hacer viral, o bueno manteniendo contenido como vos decis y con seguidores fieles
[5/24/20, 12:34:11 PM] Lore: ya no subis más videos no? podrías aprovechar en Hawaii
‎[5/24/20, 12:36:46 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 12:36:53 PM] Joe: Going viral isn’t too important. It’s more about getting a solid base of subscribers that watch all your stuff. An occasional viral video will help grow the channel faster but not really necessary.
[5/24/20, 12:36:59 PM] Joe: Yeaaah I really should’ve started making videos when I came out here but I don’t have a camera anymore cause mine broke haha.
[5/24/20, 12:37:23 PM] Joe: Hahahah thanks for subscribing 😂
[5/24/20, 12:37:34 PM] Joe: Don’t forget to smash that like button hahaha
[5/24/20, 12:37:42 PM] Lore: ah pero no se gana más dinero? con un video viral?
[5/24/20, 12:38:58 PM] Lore: con el iphone, seguro que algo decente podés sacar, si contas algo muy interesante o mostras algo quizá los seguidores, no esten tan preocupados por la calidad
[5/24/20, 12:39:16 PM] Joe: Yeah you make more from a viral video but the real key is building a consistent library of videos. Viral videos only help so much because a lot of the people that find them aren’t really that interested in the content of the channel but just that specific video.
‎[5/24/20, 12:39:42 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/24/20, 12:40:29 PM] Joe: I can’t do it haha I really notice the quality. Especially if things like the audio so I need a microphone like I was using before. But iPhone video quality should work fine.
[5/24/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck
[5/24/20, 12:41:11 PM] Lore: ah claro por el ruido!
[5/24/20, 12:41:26 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised how many people comment on a video with bad quality saying it needs to improve
[5/24/20, 12:41:28 PM] Lore: jaja cualquiera que me conozca, me diria, lore que haces siguiendo un canal de helicopteros? jajaja
[5/24/20, 12:41:44 PM] Lore: aviones de juguete, dron o como se llamen jajajaa
[5/24/20, 12:42:26 PM] Lore: y como ganas dinero con estos canales, si te dan me gusta por ejemplo o visualización?
[5/24/20, 12:42:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ll probably never post to the RC channel again 😂 but thanks for subscribing haha
[5/24/20, 12:44:25 PM] Joe: You get paid per view. What category the content is determines how much you get per view. Pretty sure technology videos and makeup videos get the highest pay per view on YouTube.
[5/24/20, 12:44:51 PM] Lore: oouuch
[5/24/20, 12:45:03 PM] Lore: odio con toda mi alma, los videos de maquillaje
[5/24/20, 12:45:40 PM] Joe: Hahahaha good, I’m glad you hate them. But just know, they make a lot of money from those 😂
[5/24/20, 12:45:44 PM] Lore: y los que explican programas con musica horrible de fondo, como electronica o techno, lo detesto también jaja
[5/24/20, 12:46:22 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that sounds annoying
[5/24/20, 12:46:46 PM] Joe: I’m going to make you a YouTube channel one of these days 😂 you’ll have to learn to be in front of the camera haha
[5/24/20, 12:47:02 PM] Lore: Si, por productos de pelo, yo alguna vez tuve que entrar, no me suelo maquillar... pero dios... 20 minutos de video para decir algo que se puede decir en 1 minuto... me ponen realmente de malhumor las chicas que hacen esos videos, tan forzado todo
[5/24/20, 12:49:08 PM] Lore: jajaja nah... yo no.🙈 en todo caso diré " that shit was slappen" y vos " ronronear" y seguro que ganamos dinero haciendo el ridículo y podemos viajar juntos a algún lado
[5/24/20, 12:49:25 PM] Lore: contamos la historia como nos conocimos, y más de alguna adolescente se engancharía a nuestro canal jajaja
[5/24/20, 12:51:42 PM] Joe: Haha its pretty hard to come off natural when making a YouTube video 😂 

You know what I would watch? Two people living together that don’t speak the same language. 

Not saying we should do this but I’d watch it hahah
[5/24/20, 12:53:25 PM] Joe: Hahahah we’ll make the “two people that don’t understand each other travel the world together” channel. 

Probably get some pure gold out of that haha
[5/24/20, 12:56:55 PM] Lore: ( pues en los videos que hiciste, te vi bastante natural)
[5/24/20, 12:58:19 PM] Lore: jajajjajaa, vos sos el rey de youtube, yo te haría caso... tenés buen material durante este tiempo
[5/24/20, 12:58:30 PM] Joe: That’s because I film them when I’m by myself mostly. That’s when I’m in my natural element. When no one is around hahaha
[5/24/20, 1:00:45 PM] Lore: Chica uruguaya vive en Madrid, chico californiano en Hawaii, se conocen por internet durante la cuarenta, con 12 horas de diferencia horaria y sin saber el idioma del otro, y planean conocerse jajaja
[5/24/20, 1:00:53 PM] Joe: I’m telling my friends you said I’m the king of YouTube hahahah. I’ve tried to convince them for years that we should be making short YouTube videos. 1 or 2 a week would’ve been enough to build a decent channel. And if everyone actually did their part it’d be easy. 

They didn’t believe you could make money though. Even when I showed them I was starting to make money haha. Before they changed the rules, now you need 1000+ subscribers before they pay you for views
‎[5/24/20, 1:01:02 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/24/20, 1:01:27 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
[5/24/20, 1:02:15 PM] Lore: jajaja un nerd experimentado! bueno seguro se te ocurre algo diferente para poder hacerlo
[5/24/20, 1:02:15 PM] Joe: Dude....we’re going to have to make that video. If we get the plans to see each other settled I’ll start documenting more to make something. Even if it’s just for us to look back on and enjoy
[5/24/20, 1:03:10 PM] Lore: jajaja sería genial
[5/24/20, 1:04:40 PM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if I ask you to record a video with your thoughts about something haha
[5/24/20, 1:06:25 PM] Lore: 😮😮😮
‎[5/24/20, 1:06:30 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/24/20, 1:06:34 PM] Lore: jajaja
[5/24/20, 1:07:31 PM] Lore: esto es de ahora? no puede ser... que puto asco de gente!!!! pero las discotecas y lugares así no estan cerrados?
[5/24/20, 1:09:17 PM] Joe: There is so much different stuff going on between the states. Some states are super strictly locked down while others are not taking it as seriously. This is in the state of Missouri yesterday
[5/24/20, 1:10:47 PM] Lore: alucinante... que poca conciencia tiene la gente, sdnklnsdlk
[5/24/20, 1:11:53 PM] Lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjoXKnoiFr0
[5/24/20, 1:12:43 PM] Lore: Viste este video? increíble como habla ese niño tan pequeño, como se explica.. es italiano, tiene cosas parecidas al español, de todos modos este video tienen los subtitulos en inglés para que lo puedas ver
[5/24/20, 1:24:54 PM] Joe: Damn that was a pretty good video. Little dude is hella cool. Thanks for sending that. Really interesting
[5/24/20, 1:27:52 PM] Joe: Half of my country thinks the disease is a hoax or that it is being blown out of proportion by the media
[5/24/20, 1:28:49 PM] Joe: I understand some of the doubt. At the beginning our government and media were telling us things like, “there is no proof it can be transmitted between people” and “wearing a mask doesn’t help” before reversing and saying the opposite and mandating that everyone wear a mask

So much bad information is causing confusion and leaving doubt in people’s mind about needing to follow the rules
[5/24/20, 1:29:19 PM] Joe: Plus America has always been full of people with a, “don’t tell me what to do” attitude. Our country was founded on that attitude haha
[5/24/20, 1:30:16 PM] Joe: But that doesn’t mean they aren’t a bunch of dummies. Cause they are and they’re making things worse. But I understand, somewhat, their mindset, even though I don’t agree with it
[5/24/20, 1:35:18 PM] Lore: de nada liiindo, me alegro que te interesen los vídeos que te envío!
[5/24/20, 1:36:07 PM] Lore: si, se hicieron las cosas muy mal, muchos intereses, nosotros acá también pensábamos lo mismo!
[5/24/20, 1:36:49 PM] Lore: pero cuando ves que gente en China, en Italia, empieza a morir... tenés que ser consciente de la situación
[5/24/20, 1:38:16 PM] Lore: A mi me jode mucho toda esta historia del corona virus, por que sé que no sabemos ni la mitad de lo que nos cuentan... y me da mucha tristeza la gente que muere, se suicida, o pierde sus casas y negocios, eso es terrible
[5/24/20, 1:38:54 PM] Lore: pero no queda más remedio, que hacer caso... dentro de lo que cabe...
[5/24/20, 1:39:08 PM] Joe: Yeah suicides are waaaaay up here in the US right now and businesses are closing fast
[5/24/20, 1:40:51 PM] Lore: pero yo que estoy viviendo esto muy cerca, estoy viendo como la gente en la calle sigue haciendo lo que quiere,  hay gente imbecil en estados unidos, en españa. siempre hay un porcentaje de gente que complica las cosas
[5/24/20, 1:41:37 PM] Joe: I don’t know it just seems messed up. Like a lot of big chain stores remained open while the mom and pop stores were forced to close. The virus is real and terrible but the economic impact is going to last a loooong time. 

So many jobs lost which will lead to more depression and suicides. They need to start giving people money because many have nothing and there is no end in sight.
[5/24/20, 1:43:27 PM] Joe: True. But I don’t expect 100% of people or even close to 100% of people to comply


Humans vary so much in their thinking and value systems that this kind of dysfunction is almost to be expected when trying to get everyone on the same page
[5/24/20, 1:50:46 PM] Lore: Si, a ver como conseguimos que nuestros países puedan volver a generar trabajos y dinero. En España lo que se dice, es que estos próximos meses la gente tiene que viajar por el país, para generar turismo entre otras provincias, consumir en locales con fabricación en España y demás cosas, pero al final será dificil...
[5/24/20, 1:51:34 PM] Lore: si totalmente, jaja hay veces que me cuesta entender como reacciona la gente, pero si, cuesta ponerse de acuerdo!
[5/24/20, 1:52:18 PM] Lore: rulitos, voy a cenar, te hablo luego! muakkk
[5/24/20, 1:52:26 PM] Lore: ( como se dice rulitos, en ignlés)
[5/24/20, 1:52:33 PM] Lore: *Inglés
[5/24/20, 1:52:53 PM] Lore: traductor dice rulits jaja asi?
[5/24/20, 1:53:15 PM] Lore: curlers sería?
[5/24/20, 1:53:33 PM] Lore: ah ahora si aparece, curls no?
[5/24/20, 1:53:36 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t understand how this plan works? They want people to travel but they don’t have money to travel hahaha
[5/24/20, 1:54:04 PM] Joe: Oook enjoy dinner. I’ll talk to you later 😚
[5/24/20, 1:54:46 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️
[5/24/20, 1:55:05 PM] Lore: Ahora empieza el verano, habrá gente que no viaje, pero habrá gente que si, sería que esa gente viaje dentro del país para que se genere más dinero
[5/24/20, 1:55:54 PM] Lore: Rulos ( es la forma del pelo que me enseñaste el otro día) rulitos ( es como más cariñoso, por el uso del diminutivo)
[5/24/20, 1:56:05 PM] Joe: Curls? Like my hair? Haha wait never mind don’t answer. Go enjoy dinner you can get back to me later haha
[5/24/20, 1:57:16 PM] Lore: 👆🏻🤙🏼
[5/24/20, 1:57:21 PM] Lore: Muak
[5/24/20, 2:56:08 PM] Lore: 🐻

[5/24/20, 3:03:39 PM] Joe: How was dinner?
[5/24/20, 3:04:00 PM] Lore: jjjj
[5/24/20, 3:04:30 PM] Lore: bien!! suave, tampoco tenía demasiada hambre, tomé un sandwich con una cerveza con Sandra
[5/24/20, 3:04:48 PM] Lore: -1 pt  jaja

[5/24/20, 3:11:55 PM] Joe: Hahahaha nice
[5/24/20, 3:12:15 PM] Lore: Mmmm no sé eh, jaja hay muchos buenos. Creo que uno no es suficiente para dejar de hablarte
[5/24/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha what if I was bad at sending gifs from the start? Would that have been a deal breaker?
[5/24/20, 3:13:44 PM] Lore: Seguramente
[5/24/20, 3:13:50 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/24/20, 3:15:28 PM] Lore: Si muchos gifs son malos, no tendríamos el mismo humor, y eso no es divertido
[5/24/20, 3:16:15 PM] Joe: Hahah damn good thing I didn’t pick a bunch of stupid gifs at first 😂 

I’ll send the bad ones when it’s too late to change your mind hahaha
[5/24/20, 3:16:56 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I totally get it. I feel the same way. If the humor doesn’t connect it’s hard to just be relaxed and have fun talking
[5/24/20, 3:18:28 PM] Lore: Jajaja vos también podés decirme cuándo envío algunos malo, así se si pierdo puntos o no
[5/24/20, 3:20:24 PM] Lore: 💃🕺claaaro, es importante!

[5/24/20, 3:32:13 PM] Joe: When we make our super famous YouTube channel we’ll have to go see some kangaroos somewhere 😂 😂
[5/24/20, 3:48:33 PM] Lore: jajajaja si!
[5/24/20, 3:49:13 PM] Lore: grabaré cuando el canguro te haga esto

[5/24/20, 3:53:11 PM] Joe: Hahaha that would definitely be a viral video 😂
[5/24/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Have you ever seen a kangaroo up close? I’ve never seen one. Doesn’t look like a good idea to get too close to them haha
[5/24/20, 4:04:52 PM] Lore: jajaja no, nunca ví ninguno tampoco!
[5/24/20, 4:05:30 PM] Lore: En Australia esta lleno, pero no me fio nada de ellos jajaja
[5/24/20, 4:13:20 PM] Lore: me despido ya, me estoy quedando dormida.. mucho rato mirando que programas y carpetas puedo eliminar, jaja y haciendo lo que dicen los videos, investigando jaja y me mató! 🤯
[5/24/20, 4:13:44 PM] Lore: mañana estamos en fase1, soy libreee, me iré a la sierra!

[5/25/20, 1:51:08 PM] Joe: Haha fuck I wish! I was thinking about how it sucks that this covid shit is keeping me from being able to go see you, then I realize I wouldn’t even know you if it wasn’t for covid hahah

[5/25/20, 1:57:43 PM] Joe: Is it working better yet?
[5/25/20, 1:58:20 PM] Lore: Jajaj esa expresión que significa?
[5/25/20, 1:59:10 PM] Lore: Una puta mierda aún, pero mañana lo abriré y veré realmente si funciona o no
[5/25/20, 2:01:07 PM] Joe: Haha oh yeah. Spill the beans is like to say, “tell me everything”
[5/25/20, 2:01:54 PM] Lore: Jajajaj okey
[5/25/20, 2:02:05 PM] Lore: Les hablé a mis mejores amigas d vos en persona hoy

[5/25/20, 2:06:52 PM] Lore: Mis amigas, son super normales... No son como tontas y superficiales ( no sé si esta es la mejor descripción)
[5/25/20, 2:07:34 PM] Lore: Pero al contarles la historia, ellas estaban diciendo, loreee, nos encanta este chico para vos!! Es genial, va a venir??? 😱Omg
[5/25/20, 2:07:52 PM] Lore: 🤷🤷🤷
[5/25/20, 2:09:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha wow ok cool. I was nervous. Didn’t expect such a reaction. I’m glad you have an excited face when talking about me haha.

[5/25/20, 2:11:16 PM] Joe: I don’t know what to say but I’m stoked that they approve haha. I’m sure you value their opinion so I’m really happy about how they reacted. 

What video did you show them though 🙈
[5/25/20, 2:12:22 PM] Lore: Jajaja nunca sabes que decir Joe
[5/25/20, 2:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha shit. Sorry 🤷‍♂️

[5/25/20, 2:20:04 PM] Joe: Yeah my friends were happy for me but not so happy when I said that going to Spain might be an option for me now haha. They don’t want me to leave them.
[5/25/20, 2:24:15 PM] Joe: I’m so interested to know what you told your friends about me. 

I told my friends that I’m talking to you and that I really want to meet you, but not much else. They don’t ask many questions though so that’s part of it
[5/25/20, 2:25:19 PM] Lore: Jajaja mis amigas no necesitan hacer demasiadas preguntas
[5/25/20, 2:25:26 PM] Lore: Me conocen y saben
[5/25/20, 2:26:43 PM] Lore: Solo hablamos varias cosas y ellas dijeron pero y qué vas a hacer? Y dije creo que el puede venir y ahí ya se volvieron locas
[5/25/20, 2:28:17 PM] Joe: Hahah niiiice. Yeah I’m definitely trying to come out there. I tried to start my passport shit the other day but I need to do it in person with certain paperwork that I don’t have with me here.
[5/25/20, 2:29:22 PM] Joe: I’d probably tell a few of my really close friends more details if I was having a one on one type of conversation but it gets weird telling all of my friends at once in a group chat 😂
[5/25/20, 2:29:49 PM] Lore: Vieron algo d tus vídeos y dijeron: hacéis muy buena pareja, es sexy, tiene cara de buena gente y nos gusta , no dudes de nada
[5/25/20, 2:30:34 PM] Lore: 😂😂😂😂
[5/25/20, 2:30:53 PM] Lore: 🙈 no puedo estar callada, siempre.tengo que contar todo jajajaa o casi todo

[5/25/20, 2:40:14 PM] Joe: As long as I tell them they can come visit me wherever I go I think they’ll be ok hahah. They say it in a joking way. They’re happy for me and if we were happy, they’d be stoked on you
[5/25/20, 2:41:07 PM] Joe: Hahaha the ultimate pocket. At first I was like 😳 hahahaha

[5/25/20, 3:29:39 PM] Lore: 😲😲😲
[5/25/20, 3:29:52 PM] Lore: Cuánto tiempo pasó?
[5/25/20, 3:31:01 PM] Joe: They’re the best
[5/25/20, 3:32:29 PM] Joe: Haha it’s a good way to sneak it. I don’t have that pocket unfortunately 😂 

It reminds me of these skate shoes from hella long ago that used to have a little pocket in the shoe. Only big enough for stuff like bags of weed haha
[5/25/20, 3:33:57 PM] Joe: Mmmm like 3 weeks. I shared some with the family hahah but yeah it went fast

[5/25/20, 3:47:23 PM] Joe: Haha I skated sooo far down the street cause I was trying to land specific tricks before turning around. Took forever but I did what I wanted. It was just for practice, I didn’t film anything

[5/25/20, 4:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahahaha gracias 😊
[5/25/20, 4:17:29 PM] Joe: I’m working on saying things with a little more confidence. When I started trying to say things, everything sounded like a question because of the unsure tone of my voice haha
[5/25/20, 4:19:42 PM] Lore: Claaaaro, hay mejoras, realmente y estás más seguro al hablar!
[5/25/20, 4:19:55 PM] Lore: Esa frase larga al principio no la hubieses dicho
[5/25/20, 4:23:52 PM] Joe: For sure. I would have been too nervous or would’ve stumbled too much to make it through confidently.
[5/25/20, 4:24:19 PM] Joe: It’s cool, the little improvements keep me motivated to learn more.
[5/25/20, 4:25:13 PM] Lore: Claro que sí, seguiré ayudándote con frases y nuevas palabras
[5/25/20, 4:26:54 PM] Lore: Me voy a ir a dormiiir, casi 3 meses sin estar tanto tiempo fuera d casa jajaja di un paseo largo a mis perras, luego tomé cerveza y fumé con mis amigas y ahora dormiré como un bebé, te dejo un lugar por si te querés pasar esta noche 🤫
[5/25/20, 4:28:07 PM] Joe: Hahaha mmm I wish I could be there with you. 

Ok sleep well. Talk to you later. Thanks for all the help. I appreciate it. Buenas noches 😘
[5/25/20, 4:29:06 PM] Lore: Buena tarde para vos rulitos! Muak 😘
[5/26/20, 12:41:12 AM] Joe: I wrote some code to find the words you’ve used the most since I started talking to you. I’m going to use it to help me study relevant words. I hope you don’t think this is weird, I figured it’d help me study 😂

[5/26/20, 1:03:25 AM] Lore: 😱😱😱
[5/26/20, 1:07:31 AM] Lore: Es raro pero no negativo, no me hubiese imaginado esto con vi el vídeo jaja
[5/26/20, 1:07:41 AM] Joe: I’ll send a copy of the file later. You can see what words you say a lot.
[5/26/20, 1:07:43 AM] Lore: Me parece útil y romántico!!! Jajaja
[5/26/20, 1:09:17 AM] Joe: Hahaha thanks. I was worried you would just think it’s weird 😂 I figured if I’m going to learn a lot of words, they might as well be the ones you use all the time
‎[5/26/20, 1:10:16 AM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[5/26/20, 1:10:58 AM] Lore: chico listo!
[5/26/20, 1:11:06 AM] Lore: Me encanta
[5/26/20, 1:13:21 AM] Joe: Hahah I’m glad you like it. Yeah there are some funny ones in the list 😂 I haven’t gone through it all the way yet. I pretty much just finished the code when I sent it to you.

[5/26/20, 1:33:10 AM] Joe: I’ve heard of those Xiaomi phone. They look cool. All my friends have iPhones though so sharing things is easier, especially video, when we all have iPhones.
[5/26/20, 1:33:50 AM] Lore: Los pijos skater de Apple
[5/26/20, 1:33:52 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/26/20, 1:34:41 AM] Joe: Haha iPhones are the best for making skateboard edits with 😂
[5/26/20, 1:34:57 AM] Lore: Jajaj okey okey
[5/26/20, 1:35:01 AM] Lore: Si puede ser
[5/26/20, 1:35:33 AM] Lore: Pero a mí me desesperaba la memoria, nunca era suficiente
[5/26/20, 1:36:23 AM] Lore: En teléfono la verdad es que ya no lo echo de menos, este Xiaomi va perfecto. Mucha gente se pasó de Apple a Xiaomi
[5/26/20, 1:36:33 AM] Lore: Y era difícil...
[5/26/20, 1:38:05 AM] Joe: Maybe I’ll try one eventually. I need to make this phone last though haha

Anyway, yeah macs have great design and look great but it’s definitely annoying when you need a program that only works on windows. I had a Mac and did a similar thing with the partition
[5/26/20, 1:48:06 AM] Joe: I ended up getting a windows laptop too. I do want that new 16” MacBook Pro though hahaha

[5/26/20, 2:01:45 AM] Lore: Pero sería mejor decir, "voy a prepararte café y tortitas" ( presente)
[5/26/20, 2:02:02 AM] Lore: "te prepararé café y tortitas" ( futuro)

[5/26/20, 2:17:19 AM] Joe: Dammit how do I get my r on point so no one can tell? Haha I’m not trying to be super obvious. Alright I need to practice R words
[5/26/20, 2:17:48 AM] Joe: I’ll just practice ronronear until I got the r sound down 😂
‎[5/26/20, 2:17:57 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[5/26/20, 2:19:09 AM] Lore: Mmm jajaja no sé, supongo que escuchando español mucho mucho. Es práctica. Pero ese acento te queda bien jaja así que no te preocupes

[5/26/20, 2:21:10 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess as long as people can understand me that’s what matters most. But I would definitely feel more confident when I speak if I knew it sounded “right”
[5/26/20, 2:22:02 AM] Lore: Jaja pero eso es muy difícil, todos tenemos un acento....
[5/26/20, 2:23:37 AM] Lore: Incluso yo hablo español, pero mi acento es diferente y por más que intenté pronunciar sin el ruido de las letras ll, como "sh" , se nota también ... Podría hacerlo pero tampoco quiero
[5/26/20, 2:23:47 AM] Joe: Haha i just like getting it right 😂 I’m not satisfied when I can tell it’s off.
[5/26/20, 2:24:17 AM] Joe: But you’re right. Everyone has a different accent. Trying to at least get close though haha
[5/26/20, 2:24:22 AM] Lore: Pero estaba biennn jaja
[5/26/20, 2:25:14 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess I see what you’re saying cause I like the way you sound haha
[5/26/20, 2:25:19 AM] Lore: Es nuestra fonética. Todos tenemos algo diferente por ejemplo al escuchar a un italiano, francés, español, cualquiera de los tres hablando inglés te darías cuenta de dónde son
[5/26/20, 2:25:36 AM] Lore: O incluso árabes hablando inglés
[5/26/20, 2:28:35 AM] Joe: That’s true haha alright I won’t put too much thought into the accent. If you hear something that’s waaaay off I need you to say something though haha
[5/26/20, 2:39:11 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/26/20, 2:39:34 AM] Lore: Claro los acentos son bonitos, habrá palabras que suenen más parecidas a nuestro acento español que otras, es práctica
[5/26/20, 2:39:54 AM] Lore: De todos modos mira qué bien te sale la pronunciación del acento uruguayo
[5/26/20, 2:40:27 AM] Lore: Parece que llevas practicandola más tiempo que la de España
[5/26/20, 2:45:13 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m not sure why that accent comes more naturally. As long as it sounds good to you that’s all that matters 🤷‍♂️
[5/26/20, 2:45:40 AM] Joe: I don’t really need to impress anyone with my spanish haha
[5/26/20, 2:46:58 AM] Joe: I’m about to go to sleep over here. Getting hella tired haha
[5/26/20, 2:49:46 AM] Lore: jajaja yo acabo de encender el ordenador
[5/26/20, 2:51:00 AM] Lore: A mi ya me impresionaste con la actitud de intentar aprenderlo!

[5/26/20, 11:44:17 AM] Lore: es que hay veces que te quiero pasar música y me olvido, y así te iba sumando canciones
[5/26/20, 11:44:31 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ll download Spotify. No big deal
[5/26/20, 11:45:02 AM] Joe: It’ll be faster than looking for the songs and that way you can keep adding to the playlist and I’ll see the songs
[5/26/20, 11:45:47 AM] Joe: Joe Rogan just signed with Spotify and I always listen to his podcast so I’m going to download it eventually anyways haha
[5/26/20, 11:47:17 AM] Lore: jaja mierda, hago que te descargues whatsapp... spotify.. jaja
[5/26/20, 11:49:16 AM] Joe: Haha it’s all good! If it makes it easier to send stuff to each other, I’m happy to download
[5/26/20, 11:50:24 AM] Lore: 💙
[5/26/20, 11:50:42 AM] Lore: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ucnZTDMcRhirltfqsSESW?si=5Hav3M2JReS33tBtS3fpQw
[5/26/20, 11:52:06 AM] Lore: El estilo de música, no sé si te gustará o te parecerá raro.. pero son buenos músicos jjj
[5/26/20, 11:52:14 AM] Joe: Hell yeah. Got it. Now you can just add songs to that playlist and I’ll hear them when they come up. Thank you thank you!
[5/26/20, 11:52:43 AM] Lore: de hecho, cuando escuché las canciones hoy, iba pensando si entenderías y creo que hay palabras que si, te puede venir bien jaja
[5/26/20, 11:53:02 AM] Joe: I like a pretty wide range of music haha. As long as it fits the mood for the day I enjoy it
[5/26/20, 11:53:24 AM] Lore: el significado de las letras, te gustaría en algunas, sobre todo de los delincuentes, que son super humildes, les encanta fumar marihuana, la naturaleza,son simples jaja
[5/26/20, 11:53:55 AM] Joe: I’ve really been liking the music you’ve sent so far too. Just send whatever you like. Anything you like to listen to. Don’t worry if I’ll like it or not, it’s more important that you like it.
[5/26/20, 11:55:16 AM] Joe: Los delincuentes also like singing about crumbs and mustaches hahaha I like their stuff for sure
[5/26/20, 11:57:11 AM] Lore: si, a mi me gusta todo este tipo de música... luego hay m
[5/26/20, 11:59:32 AM] Lore: música, estilo regueton/ reggaeton no sé si conoces.. pero es como música que se baila en las discotecas, un poco latina, y machista 😷 ..
[5/26/20, 11:59:45 AM] Lore: ijajaa sii, buena memoria!
[5/26/20, 12:00:00 PM] Lore: en tus 1.000 palabras salió lorenzo
[5/26/20, 12:01:44 PM] Joe: Haha do you want to see the list? I can send it to you
[5/26/20, 12:02:23 PM] Lore: claro, pasamela
‎[5/26/20, 12:05:59 PM] Joe: top_1000_words.csv ‎document omitted
[5/26/20, 12:06:51 PM] Joe: Hmm I’m not sure I understand this correctly. The music you like is played in the nightclubs? Or no?
[5/26/20, 12:07:26 PM] Lore: nooooo
[5/26/20, 12:07:33 PM] Lore: al contrario jaja
[5/26/20, 12:07:49 PM] Joe: Ok for sure that makes more sense haha. That’s why I was kind of confused
[5/26/20, 12:08:32 PM] Lore: que hay un gran estilo de música en español, que se llama regueton, que seguramente si conoces a alguien que hable español, es posible que te pase ese tipo de música
[5/26/20, 12:08:44 PM] Joe: Damn maybe I should make the same kind of list with the words I use. I wonder what words I use a lot 🤔
[5/26/20, 12:10:01 PM] Joe: Yeah I’ve heard of that style of music but I don’t hear it played often
[5/26/20, 12:10:53 PM] Lore: la música que yo te paso no suena en las discotecas, es más como de festival, más "hippie" por decirlo así, pero sin significado de hippie.. jaja acá cuando decís hippie, es como más informal.. mierda no sé como definirlo
[5/26/20, 12:11:21 PM] Lore: sii, hacelo porfi, y me lo pasas así aprendo yo también!
[5/26/20, 12:13:27 PM] Joe: Haha I think I get it. Hippie isn’t the most positive term around here haha. But I know what you mean when you say it
[5/26/20, 12:13:30 PM] Lore: la palabra exacta en español, sería campechano. No sé como explicarlo
[5/26/20, 12:13:50 PM] Lore: mierdaaaa
[5/26/20, 12:13:51 PM] Lore: jajaja

[5/26/20, 12:15:13 PM] Joe: Languages are so weird. I’ve been thinking lately about how imprecise they are sometimes. Words are like an abstraction of feelings so sometimes it’s hard to describe a word, especially with a language barrier 😂
[5/26/20, 12:15:47 PM] Lore: exactoooooo
[5/26/20, 12:15:59 PM] Joe: Haha alright. Should be pretty easy. I’ll send it to you later
[5/26/20, 12:15:58 PM] Lore: jajaja me siento impotente en no poder explicarte este significado
[5/26/20, 12:17:19 PM] Lore: en realidad supongo que como ahi, la gente tiene un estilo, aunque no este 100% definido... lleva un tipo de ropa, escucha un tipo de música,etc
[5/26/20, 12:17:30 PM] Joe: Hahaha I know the feeling. 

Damn....now I’m becoming really interested in the concept of languages 😂
[5/26/20, 12:18:06 PM] Lore: jajaja
‎[5/26/20, 12:18:19 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/26/20, 12:18:47 PM] Lore: y al final, el tipo de música e una persona, puede definir un poco su "cultura y personalidad", hasta acá me estas entendiendo?
[5/26/20, 12:19:17 PM] Lore: PUEDE... jaja es un pensamiento mio
[5/26/20, 12:21:10 PM] Joe: Hahah so far I get it. But I still think you’ll have to show me these people. Although, I feel like I’d recognize them if I saw them. They sound like my kind of people hahah
[5/26/20, 12:22:13 PM] Lore: jajaja si, puede serrr, pero no estoy segura! mmm tampoco escuché casi tu música, aunque se que te gusta de todo
[5/26/20, 12:22:37 PM] Lore: campechano1, campechana
Aprende a pronunciar
adjetivo
1.
[persona] Que es sencillo y cordial en el trato y no gusta de formulismos y ceremonias.
2.
Que es propio de estas personas.
"expresión campechana; aspecto campechano"
[5/26/20, 12:22:52 PM] Lore: definición de Google jaja
[5/26/20, 12:25:45 PM] Lore: la gente que escucha este tipo de música que te pasé como los delincuentes, se viste informal, como ellos, o como más alternativa...los chicos suelen llevar pelo largo y pendiente de aros de plata.. jaja, tatuajes, les gusta la naturaleza más que las ciudades, la cerveza más que un gintonic jajaja, la marihuana, la vida simple, pensamientos igualitarios en cuanto a hombres y mujeres, lo cotidiano, sin lujos...
[5/26/20, 12:26:21 PM] Lore: estoy generalizando para que puedas entenderlo, nunca tuve que explicar que es campechano o una persona que escucha los delincuentes ajjaja
‎[5/26/20, 12:27:03 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/26/20, 12:27:12 PM] Joe: Mmm I liiiike it hahah
[5/26/20, 12:28:40 PM] Joe: You did a great job explaining hahah. Not sure if I fit in with their music selection or the earrings but the rest describes me well 😆
[5/26/20, 12:29:45 PM] Lore: yo creo que encajas, por eso me gustas, jajaja pero en extranjero
[5/26/20, 12:29:49 PM] Joe: I like their music, but I’m not sure they’d like the random shit I listen to sometimes haha. I’m like a jukebox with every genre in it and it’s set to play random music
[5/26/20, 12:30:19 PM] Lore: mmmm jaja
[5/26/20, 12:31:20 PM] Lore: a estas alturas me puede dar miedo si me decis que te gusta Miley Cirus o Beyonce.. jaja
[5/26/20, 12:31:37 PM] Lore: Cyrus*
[5/26/20, 12:31:38 PM] Joe: You can feel my campechano vibes from afar 😂
[5/26/20, 12:32:13 PM] Joe: Hahahaha neither of those thankfully 😂 😂

[5/26/20, 12:34:03 PM] Lore: jajaja siii
[5/26/20, 12:35:41 PM] Lore: menos mal Joe, jaja me da un poco de miedo lo de aleatorio ajajaja,  asi que vamos, deberías hacer una playlist y subirme musica, si hay algo que no me gusta tengo que aceptarlo, cuanto más rápido mejor!
[5/26/20, 12:37:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I mean I can do that. It would just be all over the place. Some stuff you’ll like, like the things I sent you already, and some stuff you’ll hate 🤷‍♂️ 

I’m weird about music. Sometimes I’ll like a song because I heard it at a certain time, even if I usually wouldn’t like it. Same with when I like a song from a skate video I wouldn’t normally listen to.
[5/26/20, 12:38:12 PM] Joe: It’s about the feeling or memory the song gives me more than the actual song itself sometimes
[5/26/20, 12:41:22 PM] Lore: jajaja suena lógico
[5/26/20, 12:43:11 PM] Lore: si, en realidad a mi también me pasa, cuando fui a Uruguay algunas amigas y amigos, hicieron que escuche musica que en mi casa no hubiese escuchado, jaja y al final me trae recuerdos buenos y la incluyo en mis listas
[5/26/20, 12:45:30 PM] Joe: Haha now just imagine if instead of getting songs from people in Uruguay, you got songs from the people in the Bay Area that say, “this shit slaps” 😂 😂

[5/26/20, 1:07:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha nooo you don’t. But I’ll make a separate Bay Area playlist for you 😂 

I’m not really into Bay Area music anymore so don’t judge too harshly based on those songs haha but I did like it when I was younger 😂
[5/26/20, 1:08:34 PM] Lore: Jajaja quiero una de música que te guste d joven y adulto no importa!!!
[5/26/20, 1:08:51 PM] Lore: Me gustará todo segurooo
[5/26/20, 1:09:06 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll make some Spotify playlist. There will be stuff you like and stuff you hate I’m sure. Most of the songs on my current playlist are island style and the stuff you sent me but I’m going to send you stuff I used to listen to also.
[5/26/20, 1:09:58 PM] Joe: 😂 nooooo you won’t. I guarantee you won’t like everything.
[5/26/20, 1:09:58 PM] Lore: Perfecto quiero escucharlo
[5/26/20, 1:10:03 PM] Lore: No creo que lo odie
[5/26/20, 1:10:11 PM] Joe: I’m putting it together on Spotify for you now
[5/26/20, 1:10:20 PM] Lore: Yo tengo en mi lista la canción isleña que me pasaste
[5/26/20, 1:10:37 PM] Lore: Jajajaa y la escucho a menudo pq me recuerda a vos
[5/26/20, 1:11:35 PM] Lore: Si la hubiese encontrado en Youtube la hubiese escuchado solo una vez quizá jaja pero que sepas que está dentro de mi lista de siempre así que sale cada vez que la escucho completa
[5/26/20, 1:12:54 PM] Lore: 🤩
[5/26/20, 1:19:25 PM] Joe: Hahah this shit is going to make you hate me 😂
[5/26/20, 1:20:10 PM] Lore: Ya es tarde para que pueda odiarte
[5/26/20, 1:20:11 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/26/20, 1:20:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha trapped
[5/26/20, 1:20:55 PM] Lore: No podría ... Pero si querés te lo confirmo cuando lo escuche jajaja

[5/26/20, 1:34:02 PM] Joe: You’re going to hate this playlist but 🤷‍♂️ https://open.spotify.com/user/317lkjvlkv6w4riezrjqvfx5abji/playlist/2glwm6nfOv0AGqP6XjCywV?si=3zXs85S_TbG7MhLO_9Qgpw

[5/26/20, 1:40:02 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/26/20, 1:41:19 PM] Joe: Hahahah you’re probably hearing it right 😬 

I don’t really think he’s referring to women though. Just anyone that’s a bitch haha
[5/26/20, 1:41:58 PM] Lore: 🤔
[5/26/20, 1:42:15 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t like Ricky Martin! Spotify is trying to make me look bad
[5/26/20, 1:45:28 PM] Joe: It’s hard to contextualize haha I understand your reservations on that song. Not the greatest haha but i like the artist sometimes.
[5/26/20, 1:47:34 PM] Joe: He has an interesting story growing up in Compton California and a lot of his songs tell a story about growing up there. I should’ve picked a better example of his music haha but it was one of the first ones to pop up
[5/26/20, 1:47:36 PM] Lore: No la escuché entera, solo esa parte
[5/26/20, 1:48:20 PM] Lore: Pfff hubiese sido duro si era verdad . Así que me alegro mucho que la culpa sea de  Spotify jajaja

[5/26/20, 1:51:46 PM] Joe: You’ll have to report a bug to Spotify haha
[5/26/20, 1:51:45 PM] Lore: Yo no quería ver esas canciones y le di a "menos"

[5/26/20, 1:55:21 PM] Lore: Jaja ese te hace recordar a vídeos de skate verdad? Jajaja
[5/26/20, 1:55:56 PM] Lore: Las 4 primeras d la lista me gustan

[5/26/20, 2:42:01 PM] Joe: I only gave the top 1000. I think you had about 3200 words total though. I didn’t check my total

[5/26/20, 2:43:51 PM] Lore: 3200 desde que llegamos hablando?
[5/26/20, 2:43:57 PM] Lore: Y vos?
[5/26/20, 2:44:17 PM] Lore: No puede ser... 3200 son pocas
[5/26/20, 2:44:36 PM] Lore: Llevamos casi dos meses hablando
[5/26/20, 2:45:17 PM] Lore: Que vos*
[5/26/20, 2:45:35 PM] Joe: Haha I told you 80% of spoken Spanish is 1000 words so 3200 is not unreasonable in my opinion.
[5/26/20, 2:46:37 PM] Lore: Jajaja Joe y sus artículos basados en cifras de a saber dónde jajaja
[5/26/20, 2:47:05 PM] Lore: Cuántas palabras vos total?
[5/26/20, 2:47:22 PM] Joe: Haha just trying to be efficient here. I’ll check my total now. One second
[5/26/20, 2:49:16 PM] Joe: Oh and yeah having the same word spelled differently or a different conjugation of the same word will be two different words on the list
[5/26/20, 2:49:29 PM] Joe: I’ve only used 2335 words according to this haha
[5/26/20, 2:50:31 PM] Joe: Interesting data. Maybe I’ll update it again in a month or so. We can see how the words move around over time
[5/26/20, 2:52:17 PM] Lore: Interesantee!!!
[5/26/20, 2:52:18 PM] Joe: Hahah I should make a website for us that shows some visualizations for word use over time 🤔 

Seems like it’d be cool. 

It’s pretty crazy how few words it takes to communicate for a month, talking about so many different things.
[5/26/20, 2:53:28 PM] Lore: Jajaja me gustan esas ideas jajaja
[5/26/20, 2:55:46 PM] Lore: Las mismas palabras

[5/26/20, 2:58:50 PM] Lore: Ni follar, ni cojer, ni fuck (me )
[5/26/20, 2:58:53 PM] Lore: Jajajajaj
[5/26/20, 2:58:59 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/26/20, 2:59:39 PM] Joe: going to have to use those more if you want them on the list haha 🤷‍♂️
[5/26/20, 3:00:24 PM] Lore: Jajaja no me provoques

[5/26/20, 3:05:40 PM] Lore: Pero 171
[5/26/20, 3:06:04 PM] Lore: But 294
[5/26/20, 3:08:10 PM] Joe: You’re much more diverse in your word selection haha almost 1000 more words than I’ve used so far. I have hellllaaaa words to learn haha
‎[5/26/20, 3:08:28 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/26/20, 3:09:14 PM] Joe: Hahaha I want to shower you in complements but sometimes I’m worried you’ll think it’s corny.
[5/26/20, 3:10:42 PM] Joe: And words of affection too. I guess that feeling is a part of being shy. I’ll do better haha just don’t judge me too much if I say something corny
[5/26/20, 3:14:28 PM] Lore: Mmm no lo pienses tanto, si lo sentís, decilo
[5/26/20, 3:16:18 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that makes sense. I’ll do that
[5/26/20, 3:17:09 PM] Lore: Yo no lo pienso, te lo digo ... Y sé que en algunas cosas soy cursi (pero sé que no lo soy con todos, así que tengo que aprovechar) y quiero que lo sepas, te podés reír de mí cuando te diga cosas jjj
[5/26/20, 3:21:39 PM] Joe: I think it’s sweet when you say corny things haha. Especially cause I know you aren’t super into that kind of stuff, I appreciate that you can be that way with me occasionally. And you never overdue it so it always seems genuinely nice
[5/26/20, 3:31:16 PM] Lore: 🤗 gracias!!!
[5/26/20, 3:31:59 PM] Lore: Por curiosidad, que palabras de esas te gusta más que te diga?
‎[5/26/20, 3:33:04 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[5/26/20, 3:36:00 PM] Joe: 🤔 I don’t know. Hard to come up with a longer phrase off the top of my head but when you throw in a lindo, bombón, ruilitos(?) or something like that I think it’s hella cute
[5/26/20, 3:36:34 PM] Lore: Jajaja los osos
[5/26/20, 3:36:46 PM] Lore: A que tienda vas tanto?
[5/26/20, 3:37:53 PM] Lore: Jaja sí esas son las que te digo siempre, y pinocho jajaja
[5/26/20, 3:38:00 PM] Joe: Well this time is Costco but sometimes it’s a different store haha.
[5/26/20, 3:38:06 PM] Lore: Rulitos si jjj
[5/26/20, 3:38:51 PM] Lore: Pero de qué son esas tiendas?
[5/26/20, 3:38:55 PM] Joe: Haha yeah and pinocho. I love all that stuff 😂
[5/26/20, 3:40:44 PM] Joe: Ooh haha supermarkets usually. Like grocery store. 

But Costco is a biiig warehouse style store. They have everything. Groceries, electronics, clothes, appliances, you can even buy a car or a vacation from Costco 😂
[5/26/20, 3:40:48 PM] Lore: Jaja cursii, bueno espero que se te vaya la vergüenza para decir algunas que ya es hora jaja, además así aprendo inglés con esas palabras también jaja
[5/26/20, 3:42:18 PM] Lore: Ahh es un mayorista! Jjj espero que compres buenas cosas!
[5/26/20, 3:44:33 PM] Joe: I’m just getting groceries haha. My sister asked me to go.
[5/26/20, 3:47:31 PM] Joe: Words of affection in English sound way more corny to me than Spanish words haha. The only one I use is babe or baby 😂
[5/26/20, 3:49:01 PM] Joe: Sweetie, beautiful, cutie seem like not the words I want to use. It’s like I want to use their meaning but the exact word just doesn’t feel right haha
[5/26/20, 3:55:07 PM] Joe: Ok I’m about to go in this Costco. I’ll probably be in there for a while. No service in there so I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
[5/26/20, 4:01:01 PM] Lore: Estas me gustan!! Jaja
[5/26/20, 4:02:05 PM] Lore: Y estas también, jaja dios me estoy volviendo demasiado cursi. Todas me gustan 😱 jaja aunque mas las cortas
[5/26/20, 4:04:18 PM] Lore: Podés decirme las que más te gusten..para mi sonarán bien, serás el primero que me las dice jaja
[5/26/20, 4:06:30 PM] Joe: I’m stuck in line to go in haha
[5/26/20, 4:07:12 PM] Lore: Jaja
[5/26/20, 4:08:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha alright sounds good cutie 😂
[5/26/20, 4:15:36 PM] Lore: Jaja lo que vos mandes jefe

[5/27/20, 2:56:30 PM] Joe: Hahaha sounds like you’re having a good time 😂
[5/27/20, 2:57:03 PM] Joe: Skating was great. Not too hot today. I definitely need a new board and shoes when I get back to California though.

[5/27/20, 3:05:14 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[5/27/20, 3:05:59 PM] Lore: Es un trabalenguas y no podemos decirlo jaja 🍻
[5/27/20, 3:10:40 PM] Joe: Hahah I was wondering what was going on. Tongue twister made you sound extra drunk haha

[5/27/20, 3:20:49 PM] Joe: Stop being so far away. I would appreciate that very much haha
[5/27/20, 3:22:23 PM] Lore: Buah me encantaría estar cerca ahora mismo
[5/27/20, 3:23:31 PM] Lore: Creo que las cervezas( de calidad del bar) acentúan mis ganas de conocerte
[5/27/20, 3:24:11 PM] Joe: I read in the website to get my passport that there might be delays in getting one because of COVID 😩
[5/27/20, 3:24:50 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m sure that’s the case. I’m ok with that though ahah
[5/27/20, 3:25:47 PM] Lore: 😭😭😭😭
[5/27/20, 3:26:16 PM] Joe: I’m really trying to figure this out and make it happen as soon as possible. But I know it’ll be a few months at least which really really sucks.
[5/27/20, 3:27:47 PM] Lore: Te espero lo que sea necesario, auuuunque me gustaría ya
[5/27/20, 3:28:21 PM] Joe: The good news is, the longer it takes, the more time I have to practice my spanish but it’s really not a pleasant feeling not being able to see you sometimes. 

Some days after we talk I want to just end the day by laying close to you soooo bad
[5/27/20, 3:28:34 PM] Lore: Joe, crees que es posible echar de menos a una persona que no conoces?
[5/27/20, 3:29:21 PM] Lore: Deberías haber terminado la frase con la palabra "corny" hahaja
[5/27/20, 3:29:27 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve literally wanted to ask you the same for the last few days 😂 

I just keep getting this feeling of wanting to tell you I miss you
[5/27/20, 3:29:59 PM] Joe: Hahah dammit missed my chance
[5/27/20, 3:29:59 PM] Lore: Pero me sirve y me gusta que me lo digas!!!
[5/27/20, 3:30:49 PM] Lore: En serio? Jajajaja
[5/27/20, 3:31:54 PM] Joe: Yes seriously. But then I just think to myself, “that doesn’t make sense to say, you’ve never met her”..but the feeling is there
[5/27/20, 3:32:14 PM] Lore: Yo lo siento así, pero sé que no es lo normal decirlo a una persona que no conoces. Pero creo que es el significado lo que sirve, así que si, te echo de menos 😂
‎[5/27/20, 3:34:37 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted

[5/27/20, 3:38:54 PM] Joe: Why do you have to actually be a cool person and so far away at the same time? This would’ve been a lot easier if you were just boring and uninteresting 😂 

You’re torturing me haha
[5/27/20, 3:42:31 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/27/20, 3:42:58 PM] Lore: Lo mismo te digo, no entiendo por qué tuve que tener feeling con el chico que está más lejos de mi en el puto mundo
[5/27/20, 3:43:56 PM] Lore: Si viviese en España, aunque estes a unas horas intentaría agarrar un coche e ir a verte
[5/27/20, 3:44:31 PM] Lore: Pero estás en el otro lado del mundo,como, cooomo es posibel esto?
[5/27/20, 3:44:35 PM] Lore: Posible*

[5/27/20, 4:13:43 PM] Joe: Could’ve been anybody, and for some reason you messaged me, very randomly, so I blame you for everything haha. I don’t know though. I just find you interesting and ummm we have like, the same outlook on stuff a lot of the time, which is really nice. Mmm there’s so much stuff. I don’t know. There are like 6 billion humans and...I don’t know...you found me on the internet haha. Anyway, I wish I was with you. I miss you. Ok. Byyye
[5/27/20, 4:18:21 PM] Joe: Oh I also forgot to tell you. It’s pretty weird cause when I first came here to Hawaii I said I was going to focus on myself, do my own thing...girls were not supposed to be a part of it. But I don’t know how you pulled me in. You pulled me out of my shell and made me start talking and I couldn’t stop. I still can’t stop. Blah blah blah blah. Anyway, i don’t know what else to say, I’ve got lots of things to say, maybe I’ll write you a letter or something. Ok feel free to send me a video too!

[5/28/20, 5:59:46 AM] Joe: And I went a little slow
[5/28/20, 6:00:37 AM] Joe: I also messed up in there somewhere haha. If I said it fast and loud without reading it I would probably do horribly 😂 

Good practice though hahah
[5/28/20, 6:00:49 AM] Lore: Jajaja no no pero biennn
[5/28/20, 6:01:00 AM] Joe: You’ll have to do “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” hahah

[5/28/20, 11:08:05 AM] Lore: Que difícil es ese trabalenguas jajaja sh sh sh
[5/28/20, 11:09:08 AM] Lore: No puede ser, parece de película!!!
[5/28/20, 11:09:30 AM] Joe: The spanish one was way easier for me
‎[5/28/20, 11:09:54 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/28/20, 11:10:23 AM] Lore: Pero estás seguro que re corona? Acá cuando todo empezó círculó un vídeo que era de black Friday de América jaja, no de corona
[5/28/20, 11:11:08 AM] Joe: It’s all from this guy getting killed by the police 🚔
[5/28/20, 11:11:56 AM] Joe: George Floyd
[5/28/20, 11:11:56 AM] Lore: Esta loca!dios
[5/28/20, 11:12:51 AM] Joe: Yeah some insane stuff happening right now. Los Angeles had some protest on the freeway yesterday too.
[5/28/20, 11:13:21 AM] Lore: Ah mataron a un chico negro?
[5/28/20, 11:14:40 AM] Lore: Cuántos casos de estos hay, que asco de policía!!!!! Como abusa del poder y siempre con los pobres negros, no sé cómo esto sigue pasando a día de hoy, de verdad, me pone enferma
[5/28/20, 11:15:33 AM] Lore: Iba a decir, cuánta violencia en Minneapolis, pero yo haría lo mismo, que injusto
[5/28/20, 11:17:54 AM] Joe: Yeah the video went viral and it shows the officer with his knee on the mans neck for 9+ minutes. The man at the beginning was saying he can’t breathe and by the end was dead. 

Because he was suspected of using a fake $10 bill. He died over a piece of paper
[5/28/20, 11:18:21 AM] Lore: Hace un tiempo vi un vídeo horrible, un policía mata al perro de un chico negro, solo pq ladraba... me dieron ganas de llorar
[5/28/20, 11:21:10 AM] Lore: Acabo dw ver el video
[5/28/20, 11:22:50 AM] Lore: Que impotenciaaaa, que hijos de putaaaa 🤬🤬🤬 putos asesinos, pobre chico dios
[5/28/20, 11:25:41 AM] Joe: Yeah that shit was fucked up
[5/28/20, 11:26:24 AM] Joe: The same shit has been happening for years and nothing ever changes. People are tired of it
[5/28/20, 11:28:01 AM] Lore: Si boludo, es horrible. Cuánto el color de piel va a dejar de ser importante para esta gente asquerosa
[5/28/20, 11:28:48 AM] Lore: Lo peor de todo, es que son elegidos para que cuiden y protejan a la gente, y son los que terminan matando..
[5/28/20, 11:30:34 AM] Lore: *cuando
[5/28/20, 11:35:12 AM] Joe: It’s super messed up. And it really feels like nothing will change. That’s probably how the people that are setting things on fire and destroying stuff feel. Like it’ll never change
[5/28/20, 11:37:39 AM] Lore: Totalmente..
[5/28/20, 11:37:59 AM] Lore: Fuiste a alguna manifestación o similar?
[5/28/20, 11:39:26 AM] Lore: Escucha y que solución te dan para el vuelo???
[5/28/20, 11:39:54 AM] Lore: No puede ser 12 horas, reclama eso! Vos no lo compraste con esas condiciones
[5/28/20, 11:40:01 AM] Lore: Se tiene que hacer cargo la compañía
[5/28/20, 11:40:24 AM] Lore: 13 horas perdón
[5/28/20, 11:40:39 AM] Joe: No. There is nothing happening here for protest or anything. I guess a part of the problem is the country being so big.
[5/28/20, 11:41:16 AM] Joe: There are some protest in California. In Los Angeles but not as big as it should be or as big as it would take to change things
‎[5/28/20, 11:42:52 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/28/20, 11:44:02 AM] Lore: No puede ser
[5/28/20, 11:44:04 AM] Joe: Depart at 10:20a and arrive at 11:20p
[5/28/20, 11:44:07 AM] Lore: No lo aceptes
[5/28/20, 11:44:37 AM] Lore: Acá o te devuelven el dinero o te dejan cambiar de vuelo
[5/28/20, 11:44:38 AM] Joe: I have to haha
[5/28/20, 11:44:44 AM] Joe: It’s my only way back
[5/28/20, 11:45:04 AM] Lore: Seguro que lo envían por si lo aceptas
[5/28/20, 11:45:36 AM] Lore: Reclama, decí que querés aunque sea otro día cerca a esa fecha pero con tus condiciones de 5 hs, o tendrán que devolverte una parte de dinero de ese billete inicial
[5/28/20, 11:47:08 AM] Joe: Not many flights going out of Hawaii right now so I can’t really do much about it. In normal times I’d agree with what you’re saying. But for now I just have to suck it up and make the journey.
[5/28/20, 11:47:32 AM] Joe: I’ll be ok. It’ll just be one uncomfortable day
[5/28/20, 11:47:39 AM] Lore: Pero ni siquiera consultarlo?
[5/28/20, 11:48:21 AM] Joe: I mean, I checked for other flights and there aren’t any going out. This was the one. Unless I want to wait until July
[5/28/20, 11:48:47 AM] Lore: Ahhh
[5/28/20, 11:49:04 AM] Joe: I’m not really too upset about it hahah. It’s going to be annoying but it’s ok.
[5/28/20, 11:49:25 AM] Lore: 🤨
[5/28/20, 11:49:37 AM] Joe: Just have to make sure I have lots of movies and shows downloaded and have my computer charged. I’ll keep busy.
[5/28/20, 11:50:31 AM] Joe: I’m easy going 🤷‍♂️ It’s hard to make me really upset about something hahah. It’s not the end of the world
[5/28/20, 11:52:41 AM] Joe: It’d be funny if we were going on a trip together and something like this happened with the tickets. You’d probably be calling and trying to fix it...and I’ll just be saying, “honey it’s fiiiiine, no big deal”
[5/28/20, 11:53:17 AM] Lore: Jajaja exacto

[5/28/20, 11:56:27 AM] Joe: 😂
[5/28/20, 11:57:20 AM] Joe: Good news is my sister bought a ticket for the same flight. She is going to surprise my parents when they come to pick me up haha. Should be good
‎[5/28/20, 11:57:25 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/28/20, 11:57:50 AM] Joe: 😂
[5/28/20, 11:58:06 AM] Lore: Siiiii?? Eso sí es buena noticia!!!
[5/28/20, 11:58:27 AM] Joe: I mean it’s not sooo bad. Just watch movies and tv and code like I’m stuck in quarantine.
[5/28/20, 11:59:10 AM] Joe: It’ll be fun to see their reaction haha. She’s just coming for a week since she doesn’t have work right now.
[5/28/20, 11:59:38 AM] Lore: Jajaj será el único día que no hablemos
[5/28/20, 12:00:26 PM] Lore: Estoy pensando...creo que nunca pasaron 12hs 😅
[5/28/20, 12:01:10 PM] Lore: Buena elección, será divertido!!
[5/28/20, 12:01:20 PM] Joe: Flight is at 10:20a so I’ll probably send a few messages before haha
[5/28/20, 12:11:07 PM] Lore: Jjjj eso espero! 😊
[5/28/20, 12:18:07 PM] Joe: It’ll be the best part of the day for me by far hahaha
[5/28/20, 12:20:20 PM] Joe: You taking a break from the course because of the computer running slow, right? Cause I’m trying to see more of your fancy 3d stuff!
[5/28/20, 12:26:50 PM] Lore: Jajaj intentaré enviarte mensajes para que se te haga ameno el viaje en las escalas
[5/28/20, 12:27:56 PM] Lore: Jajaja, el otro día hice un poco...los findes no hago!!
[5/28/20, 12:28:57 PM] Lore: Podría enseñarte mmm, hice una cosa que me gustó..un salón, donde metí todos los ejercicios que modelé hasta ahora
[5/28/20, 12:29:27 PM] Lore: Pero no me gusta, pq ellos eligen los objetos que tuvimos que modelar, sus materiales, entonces no me gusta el estilo jajajaj
[5/28/20, 12:41:28 PM] Joe: Haha it’s alright you should still send it to me. I want to see it! It will be like when I showed you my dice game when it was ugly 😂 you can always change it after being graded on it to match your style too
[5/28/20, 12:42:47 PM] Joe: I’d like to see it and maybe if you change it later I will have an idea of the before and after haha
[5/28/20, 3:37:02 PM] Lore: Eooo
[5/28/20, 3:37:16 PM] Lore: Me quedé dormida en el sofá
[5/28/20, 3:37:43 PM] Lore: Tomé una pastilla para la alergia, ebastina y me da sueño jjj
[5/28/20, 3:37:51 PM] Lore: Siiii tenés razón!
[5/28/20, 3:48:10 PM] Joe: Haha those allergy pill knock you out 😂 No worries, sleep well babe. Buenas noches 😘
[5/28/20, 11:31:49 PM] Lore: Buenos días, ay que mal dormí 🙈
[5/28/20, 11:32:20 PM] Lore: Me gusta babe
‎[5/28/20, 11:33:14 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/28/20, 11:37:11 PM] Joe: Why didn’t you sleep well? Too much noise again?
[5/28/20, 11:38:01 PM] Joe: ♥️
[5/28/20, 11:38:36 PM] Joe: https://youtu.be/BQ4c54rCJ_k
[5/28/20, 11:39:22 PM] Lore: No, alergia, calor/frío
[5/28/20, 11:39:51 PM] Joe: Some Reebok or some nike always makes me feel better 😂
[5/28/20, 11:40:13 PM] Lore: jajajajaj
[5/28/20, 11:40:20 PM] Joe: That sucks though. Sorry. Get you some extra strong coffee
[5/28/20, 11:41:02 PM] Lore: Que tal el español?
[5/28/20, 11:41:27 PM] Lore: Síii ya tengo uno en mi mano jajajaa
[5/28/20, 11:43:23 PM] Joe: My spanish? Terrible haha
[5/28/20, 11:43:46 PM] Lore: Pinochito, eso es mentira
[5/28/20, 11:45:10 PM] Joe: Eh I still can’t talk to you on the phone and that really sucks. So not good enough
‎[5/28/20, 11:51:32 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/28/20, 11:54:48 PM] Joe: I was thinking lately about how awkward it’s going to be to try and talk on the phone for the first time.  I hope you’re ready for that  haha 
I’ll barely understand anything and not be able to form great responses. It’s really not going to be easy at first and might feel really strange.
[5/28/20, 11:54:56 PM] Lore: Jaja yo también lo pensé el día que te llamé sin querer, dije, mierda... No podemos hablar
[5/28/20, 11:55:26 PM] Lore: Pero estamos buscando la manera de comunicarnos y me alegro por ello, ya llegará. Prometo aprender inglés jaja
[5/28/20, 11:56:48 PM] Lore: Que locura!!!!
[5/28/20, 11:57:41 PM] Joe: I just want you to be prepared for it to be difficult and a little weird at first. It might even feel discouraging the first time. 

I’m willing to work through all that and I’m trying to be upfront about the reality of how hard it might be since it’ll take time
[5/28/20, 11:59:09 PM] Lore: Estuve viendo algunos vídeos, creo que es necesario que la gente responda así, que de vuelta al mundo esta noticia y que se haga justicia ... Lo único que al final, con tanta violencia pueden salir muchos heridos, incluso policías que no tienen culpa de ello e igual ni defienden comos se comportaron esos 4 compañeros y eso no me gusta
[5/29/20, 12:00:56 AM] Lore: Jajaja si me lo decís así .. bueno en algún momento lo haremos o podemos hacerño al conocernos en el aeropuerto, te imaginas?
[5/29/20, 12:00:58 AM] Lore: Jajajaja
‎[5/29/20, 12:01:49 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/29/20, 12:05:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha that would be great actually 😂
[5/29/20, 12:05:57 AM] Joe: Yeah I agree. It’s getting a little out of hand, hopefully more people aren’t hurt. The people that live there will live with the destruction for a long time
[5/29/20, 12:08:16 AM] Joe: I honestly wouldn’t mind not being able to communicate in person compared to on the phone. I think I can figure out how to get the idea across for most things in person but on the phone it’s all verbal.
[5/29/20, 12:11:56 AM] Lore: Exactooo, a mí no sé hasta qué punto me importaría pq aunque no te conozco en persona sé varias cosas de tu vida, y podría decir que me sentiría en confianza aunque no sepa casi nada, supongo que la sonrisas, las miradas y los gestos nos ayudarán
[5/29/20, 12:17:44 AM] Joe: sólo quiero ser un mimo con usted jaja sería tan divertido
[5/29/20, 12:18:02 AM] Joe: sólo quiero ser un mimo contigo jaja sería tan divertido
[5/29/20, 12:18:07 AM] Joe: Better haha
[5/29/20, 12:18:45 AM] Lore: Mucho mejor!!!!
[5/29/20, 12:19:01 AM] Lore: Jaja es muy "guiri" cuando alguien dice usted
[5/29/20, 12:19:43 AM] Lore: O podría ser " solo quiero ser un mimo con vos/tu"
[5/29/20, 12:22:10 AM] Joe: jaha voy a tratar de traducir lo que digo antes de enviarlo más a menudo para que pueda obtener algunas cosas raras. Voy a tratar de corregirlo antes de enviarlo. buenas prácticas
[5/29/20, 12:22:28 AM] Joe: Con vos haha like you would say
[5/29/20, 12:22:53 AM] Lore: Esta bien que pienses y veas el error
[5/29/20, 12:23:40 AM] Lore: Esooo es!! Jjj me hace ilusión que aprendas español con mi acento
[5/29/20, 12:24:35 AM] Lore: Si a mí me toca hablar con alguien en inglés, y hace una comedia rica le direee " this shit hella slaps yoo" era así no?
[5/29/20, 12:26:38 AM] Joe: Hahah people will be so confused about how you learned that out of all the English phrases to learn 😂
[5/29/20, 12:28:29 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/29/20, 12:28:48 AM] Lore: Estoy deseando poder utiliSr eso cuando hagas tortitas
[5/29/20, 12:30:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha you have to use “smackin” for the tortitas 🥞 “Slaps” and “slappin” for the music 🎶
[5/29/20, 12:31:01 AM] Lore: Ahhhhh
[5/29/20, 12:31:05 AM] Lore: Jajaj pensé que servía para todo
[5/29/20, 12:31:16 AM] Lore: Jajaj perfecto entendió, lo voy a apuntar en mis notas
‎[5/29/20, 12:32:07 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/29/20, 12:33:00 AM] Lore: Estas cosas que aprendí fue de friends jajaja solo apunté las que me interesaban 😅
[5/29/20, 12:34:33 AM] Joe: Hahah you definitely have some interesting ones 😂
[5/29/20, 11:51:26 AM] Joe: Buenos diaaaas. I’m out skating as you saw haha. It’s soo hot I’m dying out here. Got a long skate home now
[5/29/20, 11:52:08 AM] Joe: Well buenos días for me hahah i meant holaaaa
‎[5/29/20, 11:55:03 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/29/20, 12:24:03 PM] Lore: hoooolaaa!!!
[5/29/20, 12:25:34 PM] Lore: Siii vi en el sitio bonitooo!
[5/29/20, 12:25:56 PM] Lore: Acá mucho calor en Madrid también! Buena patinada de vuelta a casa
[5/29/20, 12:26:45 PM] Lore: Que linda es hasta la calle jaja, super verde ese césped. Quiero se barquito
[5/29/20, 12:28:19 PM] Lore: Yo hoy firmé contrato de la casa! Se fue nuestra compañera la loca, que felicidad!!!
[5/29/20, 12:35:58 PM] Lore: Joe, como puedo robar internet al vecino?
[5/29/20, 12:36:25 PM] Lore: Bueno... Jajaja compartir sin que el sepa, es que no tenemos wifi ahora mismo hasta el lunes 😣
[5/29/20, 12:38:47 PM] Joe: Hahaha unless he has an unsecured router you’d have to guess their password or trick them into giving it to you. Social engineering haha
‎[5/29/20, 12:41:54 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/29/20, 12:43:09 PM] Lore: Jajaja no, sería sin que se enteren. Como puedo hacerlo?
[5/29/20, 12:43:25 PM] Lore: Buuu pensé que eras un nerd rebelde jajaja
[5/29/20, 12:44:44 PM] Joe: Haha accessing password protected systems is all about tricking the person, not the computer.
[5/29/20, 12:45:56 PM] Joe: That’s why people send “fishing emails”. A fake email that looks real and ask for your info. Then instead of sending it to the bank or internet service provider or whatever, the info goes to the hacker dude haha
[5/29/20, 12:45:58 PM] Lore: Mmm no hay ningún programita que se pueda averiguar su clave?
[5/29/20, 12:49:01 PM] Joe: If the password is halfway decent no program can guess it in a reasonable time.
[5/29/20, 12:49:51 PM] Joe: Also some things only let you guess a few times before sending an email or requesting you reset the password. 

Soooorrrryyy 😐
[5/29/20, 12:51:10 PM] Lore: Mmmm
[5/29/20, 1:05:19 PM] Lore: Jaja okey okeyyy
[5/29/20, 2:59:23 PM] Lore: Que tal patinando??
[5/29/20, 3:02:32 PM] Joe: estaba bien. Realmente necesito una nueva tabla y zapatos, pero todavía era divertido
[5/29/20, 3:03:18 PM] Joe: I haven’t skated as much as I should’ve while I’ve been out here too. So I’m not feeling as good on the board as I usually do
‎[5/29/20, 3:04:22 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/29/20, 3:07:57 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno, está bien también, estuviste relajado y cuando vuelvas 🔥
[5/29/20, 3:10:51 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully. Less than two weeks left of relaxing. How was your day??
[5/29/20, 3:12:41 PM] Lore: Muy bien, estuve en un rio pasando la mañana, me dio el sol, estaba súper blanca
[5/29/20, 3:16:13 PM] Lore: Y luego algo importante, la compañera se fue esta mañana y firmamos nuevo contrato con el dueño de la casa, era casi seguro, pero hasta que no firmasemos ..buscar piso otra vez en Madrid sería horrible jaja
[5/29/20, 3:17:36 PM] Joe: Damn well it sounds like things were going well for you today haha
‎[5/29/20, 3:18:45 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/29/20, 3:31:38 PM] Lore: Jaja, noo tanto no! Solo me pican un poco los cachetes
[5/30/20, 12:14:34 PM] Joe: Holaaa

Everything is going to shit in the US haha. Hella cities were protesting yesterday. Shit is getting wild
[5/30/20, 12:45:32 PM] Lore: Buenos días para vos!!
[5/30/20, 12:48:05 PM] Lore: Siiii, es incontrolable cómo está la gente por lo que se ve en las noticias!
[5/30/20, 12:53:52 PM] Joe: I wonder how long this will last. Oakland had some stuff happening last night that looked so crazy.
[5/30/20, 12:54:17 PM] Lore: Sii? Que pasó?
[5/30/20, 12:54:31 PM] Lore: Y por dónde vivís vos? Esta seguro?
[5/30/20, 12:54:40 PM] Joe: Oh some good news I guess....rocket launched today haha https://youtu.be/pMsvr55cTZ0
[5/30/20, 12:55:55 PM] Joe: They were just breaking into buildings, starting fires, stealing stuff. Even saw a video of someone stealing a new car from an indoor dealership. They drove it right out the door 🤯
[5/30/20, 12:57:17 PM] Lore: 😱😱😱
[5/30/20, 12:59:49 PM] Lore: Boludo el mundo está loco, nuestra generación está viviendo unas cosas super fuertes
[5/30/20, 1:01:53 PM] Joe: So much shit. The protest remind me of occupy wallstreet protest but with a lot more anger.

[5/30/20, 1:19:54 PM] Lore: La vii, y me encaaantó!!!
[5/30/20, 1:20:48 PM] Lore: Si esto me recuerda también, la gente se revela, todos seríamos como joker
[5/30/20, 1:23:46 PM] Joe: Yeah that was a really good movie. I loved the concept. He was just pushed too far and lost it
[5/30/20, 1:23:56 PM] Joe: Now that’s happening to everyone
[5/30/20, 1:24:21 PM] Joe: My friend was at the protest in Oakland last night and is telling me downtown is completely destroyed.
[5/30/20, 1:26:38 PM] Lore: Si el guión muy bueno, pero la música, las tomas, y el actor, todo demasiado bueno, la ví en el cine
[5/30/20, 1:30:25 PM] Lore: Que locura! Igual terminan las protestas antes de que llegues
[5/30/20, 1:34:55 PM] Joe: I’m going back to so much chaos haha. Much different than being secluded on the island. Island life was nice while it lasted I guess. 


I’ll be back though
[5/30/20, 1:35:12 PM] Joe: How are you feeling today?
[5/30/20, 1:36:47 PM] Lore: Jaja sí, yo con vos si me dejas un lugar

[5/30/20, 1:49:45 PM] Joe: You always with the drink in hand 🍻
[5/30/20, 1:51:07 PM] Joe: I don’t know why but I love when you say something is “super bien” hahaha that’s probably so random but it’s true 😂
[5/30/20, 1:53:43 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, llevábamos horas pensando si no obedecer a las reglas del gobierno. Teníamos la opción de ir a un bar es lo que está permitido o en una casa, pero nosotras teníamos ganas de estar ahí . Es una mini poza y es súper íntima jaja nadie te molesta
[5/30/20, 1:54:09 PM] Lore: 🙈 que mala imagen te doy jaja
[5/30/20, 1:54:53 PM] Lore: Cómo? Jajaj mmm no entendí esto repetimelo porfi
[5/30/20, 1:56:51 PM] Joe: Ooh that sounds like my favorite kind of place. With no people haha. So weird that they let you go to a bar but not into nature. A bar seems much more likely to get you sick than sunbathing at a cool spot like that. I hope they don’t catch you hahah
‎[5/30/20, 1:57:41 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 1:58:46 PM] Joe: I like the phrase “super bien” when you say it. 

You’ve said it a few times when you send me audio and you always say it in such a happy way haha
[5/30/20, 2:01:15 PM] Lore: Si jaja quieren recaudar dinero, pero nosotras tomamos buena decisión, jaja cuando nos fuimos al coche estábamos contentas jaja
[5/30/20, 2:01:24 PM] Lore: Jajaja fuck
[5/30/20, 2:03:17 PM] Lore: Ah jajaja si? No me doy cuenta, pero si un súper día así me hace feliz
[5/30/20, 2:07:26 PM] Joe: I like that you all wanted to go to a spot like that, even though you’re not supposed to haha
[5/30/20, 2:08:36 PM] Joe: Glad you had a good time.
[5/30/20, 2:09:25 PM] Joe: Yeah I can definitely hear it in your voice. Makes me wonder what you sound like when your mad 😡 hahaa I cant imagine it
[5/30/20, 2:14:04 PM] Lore: Jajaja mmm sonará mal, supongo como a todo el mundo cuando se enfada jajaja
[5/30/20, 2:14:59 PM] Lore: Gracias Joseph! Jaja
[5/30/20, 2:15:34 PM] Lore: Como estás vos?? Ayer patinando mucho o algo más? Hoy cómo se presenta?
[5/30/20, 2:19:46 PM] Joe: Yeah skated a lot yesterday so I’m a liiittle sore today. But I still went to skate early this morning. I need to be ready for summer cause everyday will be a long day of skating. My skateboard is falling apart but I’m so close to going back I need to make it last. 

It’s cloudy now so I’ll be at home for the rest of the day. I have to work on some stuff today.
[5/30/20, 2:21:07 PM] Joe: Which reminds me...you still have to show me your 3d model you made sometime, even though you don’t like it. I’m not going to forget haha
[5/30/20, 2:25:40 PM] Lore: Ohhh jaja siii, ahí es caro para volver con una tabla de Hawaii?
[5/30/20, 2:26:06 PM] Lore: En que trabajas hoy??
[5/30/20, 2:27:14 PM] Lore: Yo vuelvo a trabajar en mi trabajo, sabes qué día?? El día de tu vuelo a California jaja me pareció casualidad
[5/30/20, 2:28:08 PM] Lore: Ohhhh jaja no te olvidas ehh, si el lunes te prometo que te mando cuando recupere el wifi jajaja
[5/30/20, 2:31:29 PM] Joe: Just helping to make some visual changes to a website for someone. It’s a website I worked on previously.
[5/30/20, 2:33:07 PM] Joe: Haha damn back to work. I really hope we keep talking as things get back to normal. I’m still practicing my spanish everyday 😂
[5/30/20, 2:33:53 PM] Lore: Que biennn! Yujuu
[5/30/20, 2:34:47 PM] Lore: Espero que me sigas hablando vos cuando vuelvas a California, estarás super ocupado con el skate jaja
[5/30/20, 2:35:04 PM] Lore: Luego quiero verlo, tenés que mostrarmelo
[5/30/20, 2:38:48 PM] Joe: Haha It’ll definitely be a little more effort to keep in touch but I’ll do my best.
[5/30/20, 2:41:05 PM] Joe: But I do want to make that if it becomes too much or too difficult that you’ll say something. Just be honest about everything is all I really ask.
[5/30/20, 2:45:37 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll send the link when it’s done ✅
[5/30/20, 2:48:41 PM] Lore: No entiendo, a que te referís?
[5/30/20, 2:50:23 PM] Lore: Mm no sé si es malo o bueno
[5/30/20, 2:50:55 PM] Joe: Hmm....if you feel like continuing to talk to me is too much effort or you’re just not into it anymore for whatever reason, I want you to communicate that to me
[5/30/20, 2:52:59 PM] Lore: Mmm para nada! Me gusta hablar con vos Joe, no me va a pasar eso!
[5/30/20, 2:53:19 PM] Lore: Vos pensás que a vos si? Jaja
[5/30/20, 2:56:51 PM] Joe: I don’t want to stop talking to you for any reason and I know you feel the same. 

But if for some reason things change when our schedules get busy I want you to be able to talk to me about without feeling bad or anything.
‎[5/30/20, 3:02:05 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[5/30/20, 3:02:25 PM] Lore: Mmm
[5/30/20, 3:02:47 PM] Lore: Bueno si algo pasa, te lo diré.  Vos a mí también pinocho
‎[5/30/20, 3:04:01 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 3:11:11 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I never asked haha what is your job right now?
[5/30/20, 3:11:14 PM] Lore: Jajaja divertido este robo!
[5/30/20, 3:12:14 PM] Lore: Por un lado hago proyectos por mi cuenta, y por otro para tener un ingreso fijo trabajo en un showroom de mobiliario
[5/30/20, 3:16:29 PM] Joe: Oh ok that’s cool.
[5/30/20, 3:17:12 PM] Joe: If the furniture showroom is opening, most things must be opening at that time, no?
[5/30/20, 3:19:08 PM] Lore: No es cool jaja, solo estoy ahí por qué es un sueldo fijo..  hay a otras chicas que les gusta a mí me aburre un poco 🙄
[5/30/20, 3:19:49 PM] Lore: Todas las tiendas inferiores a 400m2 abrieron, las que son más grandes, como la mía, solo puede abrir una o dos plantas
[5/30/20, 3:23:58 PM] Joe: Hahah we have to get you your own business up and running. Lore the designer
‎[5/30/20, 3:24:59 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 3:26:40 PM] Lore: Jaja sí en algún momento! 💪
[5/30/20, 3:27:28 PM] Lore: Estoy esperando a terminar de aprender el 3D y así hacer un portfolio más completo
‎[5/30/20, 3:29:13 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 3:32:57 PM] Joe: Haha I understand that. I need to work on my portfolio. It’s a disaster. I should hire someone to redesign it for me
[5/30/20, 3:35:49 PM] Lore: Pero por qué no lo hacés vos? Como es el portfolio que entregas en tu profesión?
[5/30/20, 3:41:55 PM] Joe: I made one. But it’s ugly. I use it to show clients that I can make stuff haha. Although most of my clients so far I’ve got from word of mouth(referrals)

https://hone1er.github.io/reactPortfolio/
[5/30/20, 3:43:07 PM] Joe: I need to add more projects that I’ve done and do a complete redesign of the look. But I suck at design so I need to hire someone haha
‎[5/30/20, 3:46:27 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
‎[5/30/20, 3:52:06 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/30/20, 3:53:36 PM] Lore: Lo veo bien el portfolio, está claro. No sé por qué decís que está mal
[5/30/20, 3:53:57 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s true. I did do a bunch of work to make sure it looks good on mobile
[5/30/20, 3:54:00 PM] Lore: Es diferente a como entregamos nosotros, documento PDF con texto e imágenes
[5/30/20, 3:54:25 PM] Lore: Lo sé jaja
[5/30/20, 3:54:55 PM] Joe: 😬
[5/30/20, 3:55:45 PM] Joe: I don’t know I just don’t think it looks good. I should make it more “professional” looking. Straight lines, black and white, you know like a modern look
[5/30/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: It could be cleaner. And the section where i show my work could be done better. Especially as I add more projects
[5/30/20, 3:57:27 PM] Lore: Puedo intentar ayudarte si querés
[5/30/20, 3:57:59 PM] Lore: Volvemos a trabajar juntos jaja
[5/30/20, 3:58:21 PM] Joe: I’ll take I’ll the help I can get but you don’t have to haha
‎[5/30/20, 3:58:50 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
‎[5/30/20, 4:03:29 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/30/20, 4:04:56 PM] Joe: That is the files with the code but even that should have a better “readMe” that explains what it was
[5/30/20, 4:06:08 PM] Joe: That wasn’t a website. It was some code that automated the process of transferring scores from one website to another for my friend that is a teacher. It’s hard to display stuff like that in a portfolio haha
[5/30/20, 4:06:57 PM] Lore: Mmm vale
[5/30/20, 4:07:00 PM] Lore: No entendí nada jaja
[5/30/20, 4:07:06 PM] Joe: Hahaha
‎[5/30/20, 4:07:22 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 4:07:34 PM] Joe: 😂
[5/30/20, 4:08:05 PM] Lore: Pensé que era algo como que dabas clases, como profesor
[5/30/20, 4:08:32 PM] Lore: Y entré al link y ví última actividad 8 meses y 0 ref, etc
[5/30/20, 4:08:38 PM] Lore: A eso me refería yo
[5/30/20, 4:09:44 PM] Lore: Falta la web de tu amigo, esa que me mostraste de ropa . Esa estaba bien también
[5/30/20, 4:10:44 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s because I didn’t finish it yet. 

I have a bunch of unfinished websites hahaha.
[5/30/20, 4:11:17 PM] Joe: I’m still waiting on my friend to give me the items and all the info I need.
[5/30/20, 4:16:33 PM] Lore: Mmmm jaja ya estoy dándole vueltas
[5/30/20, 4:17:37 PM] Joe: The portfolio? What are you doing hahah
[5/30/20, 4:17:51 PM] Lore: Jaja sí
‎[5/30/20, 4:17:52 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 4:18:13 PM] Lore: Estaba mirando otros portfolios d desarrolladores web
‎[5/30/20, 4:18:29 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 4:18:55 PM] Joe: Oooh that’s a good idea
[5/30/20, 4:19:51 PM] Lore: Creo que hay que elegir esos colores, blanco y negro e incluso otro que haga contraste. Solo tres
[5/30/20, 4:20:42 PM] Lore: Una foto tuya o algo, siempre es más fiable poner cara
[5/30/20, 4:21:29 PM] Lore: Y separar por bloques las cosas, solo en una vista que se pueda pinchar lo que realmente interesa
[5/30/20, 4:22:35 PM] Lore: Si al final hay alguien que duda, no bajará hasta abajo
[5/30/20, 4:23:18 PM] Joe: Sounds like a lot of work haha I agree on the colors and maybe a picture would be good too.
[5/30/20, 4:24:10 PM] Joe: I don’t know how I’d do the layout to make the blocks better like you say
‎[5/30/20, 4:24:34 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/30/20, 4:24:50 PM] Joe: Mmm ok ok
[5/30/20, 4:25:44 PM] Lore: https://www.lancetalent.com/blog/crear-portfolio-freelance-fp/
[5/30/20, 4:25:52 PM] Joe: But then I need to have a design for both mobile and desktop
[5/30/20, 4:26:10 PM] Joe: Oh siiiick. Alright I’ll take a look at this
[5/30/20, 4:28:55 PM] Lore: Claro
[5/30/20, 4:29:12 PM] Lore: Jaja así prácticas español también
[5/30/20, 4:30:11 PM] Joe: Haha true
[5/30/20, 4:30:53 PM] Joe: I was thinking I should get a book in spanish haha.
[5/30/20, 4:31:40 PM] Joe: Oh also, I want to make a simple website that is basically flash cards with the words in the list that I made
‎[5/30/20, 4:31:46 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[5/30/20, 4:32:49 PM] Joe: 😂 no te gusta?
[5/30/20, 4:32:51 PM] Lore: Tarjetas? De que lista?
[5/30/20, 4:33:30 PM] Lore: Nada ese color rosa 🤢 supuestamente este es uno de los ejemplos jaja
[5/30/20, 4:34:26 PM] Lore: Pero el primero que sale, pone un detallito naranja en la palabra portfolio y luego una franja debajo
[5/30/20, 4:34:31 PM] Joe: Hmm “flash cards” is like in school you write on a card to study. You put a question on the front and answer on the back.
[5/30/20, 4:35:15 PM] Joe: I want to make a my own flash cards but on the computer cause it would be more fun than writing them on actual cards haha
[5/30/20, 4:37:06 PM] Lore: Síii pero de qué? De idioma decís?
[5/30/20, 4:37:10 PM] Joe: Yeah I really like the first one. Very clean, lots of attention to detail.
[5/30/20, 4:37:40 PM] Joe: Oh yeah language. The list of your words
[5/30/20, 4:37:50 PM] Lore: Y su foto también me gusta, el toque del gorro informal
[5/30/20, 4:39:02 PM] Lore: El tuyo, los rulitos y un gorro que no ponga math ( para el trabajo nada de política jaja)
[5/30/20, 4:40:02 PM] Joe: Haha now I need a new design and a photo shoot
‎[5/30/20, 4:40:17 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/30/20, 4:42:22 PM] Lore: Mmmm y cómo vas a hacer esa web, ya pensaste en diseño?
[5/30/20, 4:44:02 PM] Joe: Not at all. I usually make it functional before doing the design but maybe if I do the design first it will come out better.
[5/30/20, 4:44:11 PM] Joe: I won’t have to make so many changes either
[5/30/20, 4:47:07 PM] Lore: Mmm jajaja tantas preguntas
[5/30/20, 4:47:13 PM] Lore: Me entra mucha curiosidad todo esto
[5/30/20, 4:47:55 PM] Lore: Pero te dejaré trabajar!
[5/30/20, 4:48:51 PM] Lore: Que tengas buena tarde y sea productivo el día!
[5/30/20, 4:48:56 PM] Joe: Alright if you say so. Ask questions anytime haha
[5/30/20, 4:49:07 PM] Joe: Gracias!
[5/30/20, 4:49:48 PM] Joe: I’ll talk to you later. Buenas nochesss
[5/30/20, 4:50:15 PM] Lore: Gracias!
[5/30/20, 4:50:36 PM] Lore: Esta Kenya en mi cama, está teniendo pesadillas jaja

[5/31/20, 3:47:42 PM] Lore: Perdona no te respondí, justo volvía de la sierra y vino Luchi a casa, su primera noche
[5/31/20, 3:49:44 PM] Lore: Síii no dije nada cuando vi tu mensaje por qué no quería "desvelarte"
[5/31/20, 3:51:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja estás muy cansado?
[5/31/20, 3:55:10 PM] Joe: Haha no worries
‎[5/31/20, 3:55:32 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/31/20, 3:55:37 PM] Joe: Well I was this morning haha I had coffee and did my usual morning stuff so I’m good now
[5/31/20, 3:57:19 PM] Lore: Que que tal como fue la mañana?
[5/31/20, 3:57:42 PM] Lore: Hoy diste clase?
[5/31/20, 3:57:48 PM] Joe: Super bien haha
[5/31/20, 3:58:13 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[5/31/20, 3:58:56 PM] Joe: No class today yet. I might call later though. How was your day? You must be stoked to have your friend there with you now.
[5/31/20, 3:59:21 PM] Joe: Does this mean I’m a secret haha
[5/31/20, 4:00:37 PM] Lore: Siiii, ella estará un mes solo, pero espero que sirva para su relación y pueda tomar una decisión!
[5/31/20, 4:00:57 PM] Lore: Cómo? Jaja
[5/31/20, 4:05:30 PM] Joe: Yeah that should give her some decent time and space to think about stuff. And she’s with a friend so it seems healthy.
‎[5/31/20, 4:06:05 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[5/31/20, 4:07:26 PM] Lore: Siiiii, con Sandra hicimos de cenar una pizza y un lambrusco( vino rosado) jaja para su bienvenida
[5/31/20, 4:07:43 PM] Lore: Jajaj decimeee
[5/31/20, 4:08:32 PM] Lore: Un secretoo?
[5/31/20, 4:10:59 PM] Joe: Your message translated to you not wanting to reveal me. So i was asking does Luchi not know about me? I was just playing around though haha
[5/31/20, 4:12:08 PM] Joe: Lit haha sounds like she will have a great month there 😂 

Too bad you have to go back to work soon
[5/31/20, 4:12:39 PM] Lore: Ahhh jajaja
[5/31/20, 4:13:12 PM] Lore: Vos no sos secreto para nada bombón!
[5/31/20, 4:14:03 PM] Lore: Si quería decir que cuando vi tu mensaje de Instagram, vi que era super pronto y no quería que te desveles...

[5/31/20, 4:21:41 PM] Joe: Do you have any fun plans before you have to go back to work? You have to take advantage of the time you have left haha
[5/31/20, 4:21:44 PM] Lore: Jajaja que gif de respuesta 🥴
[5/31/20, 4:22:39 PM] Joe: Hahaha whatever dude
[5/31/20, 4:25:03 PM] Lore: Okkkey dudee
[5/31/20, 4:26:44 PM] Lore: Si llevo todos estos días haciendo lo que más me gusta, hacer planes de naturaleza.. con mi familia, amigos, etc
[5/31/20, 4:29:19 PM] Joe: Siiick. Yeah I’m trying to take advantage of my time out here. Just about 1 week to go 😞
[5/31/20, 4:30:08 PM] Lore: Sii, tenemos el mismo tiempo
[5/31/20, 4:30:48 PM] Joe: Remember when we first started talking it felt like it would never end? Haha now we’re counting down the days
[5/31/20, 4:32:42 PM] Lore: Jaja yo no lo pasé mal durante la cuarentena, solo un poco de incertidumbre algún momento por no saber cuándo volver a la vida normal
[5/31/20, 4:33:23 PM] Lore: Ahora estoy disfrutando del tiempo libre sin trabajar y con una semana para asimilarlo jaja
[5/31/20, 4:34:30 PM] Lore: Vos, ya tenés casa en California? Cuáles son tus planes?
[5/31/20, 4:36:09 PM] Joe: No I didn’t find anything online so I’m just going to go to my parents for a bit while I look in person. 

Work doesn’t start until the 15th so I have so time when I get back to figure it out. Maybe the riots have lowered rent prices haha
[5/31/20, 4:38:53 PM] Lore: Haces bien, además es mejor estar ahí y poder ir a ver la habitación, muchas veces las fotos engañan
[5/31/20, 4:40:02 PM] Lore: Cuánto tiempo es el skatecamp? Del 15.. hasta?
[5/31/20, 4:41:47 PM] Joe: It goes until school starts at in August. I think it’s about 10 weeks total.
[5/31/20, 4:42:56 PM] Lore: Uoo, es tiempo! Pensé que sería menos
[5/31/20, 4:43:51 PM] Lore: Y cómo es? Duermen en algún sitio todos juntos? O solo clases de skate en un skatepark?
[5/31/20, 4:44:47 PM] Joe: It’s only a daytime thing so just lessons in the park. The kids are dropped off weekday mornings and picked up every afternoon.
[5/31/20, 4:45:48 PM] Joe: We also have a building that has games and stuff in it but I’m not sure how much we’ll be using that stuff this year. It’s going to be really weird, with a bunch of special rules this year.
[5/31/20, 4:47:49 PM] Lore: Ah muy bien, se te pasa rápido seguro enseñándoles
[5/31/20, 4:48:59 PM] Lore: Yaaa, todo cambia! Mucho protocolo! Cuántos niños apuntados hay?
[5/31/20, 4:51:04 PM] Joe: I think they’re going to limit it to 10 children per “session”. The sessions used to be 1 week but now I think they’ll be 2 or 4 weeks so that the kids aren’t switching camps as often.
[5/31/20, 4:52:27 PM] Joe: I’m wondering how much staff they’ll give us though. Last year we had the bare minimum. We definitely could’ve used one more staff member. 

But now since we get less kids, I’m sure they’ll try to give us less staff again
[5/31/20, 4:56:50 PM] Lore: Antes eran más de 10 niños por sesión? Cuántos profesores?
[5/31/20, 4:58:05 PM] Lore: Seguramente se apunten varios niños, los padres estén desesperados todo este tiempo y deben querer enviarlos a que gasten toda su energía con Joe jajaj
[5/31/20, 4:58:54 PM] Joe: Hahah I hope a lot of kids sign up. I’m pretty sure we can get at least 10 haha.
[5/31/20, 4:59:21 PM] Joe: I don’t know how many teachers we get. Hopefully 3. They’ll probably try to make us do it with 2(me and one other)
[5/31/20, 5:36:16 PM] Lore: Ah genial! Seguro que hay mucho trabajo
‎[5/31/20, 5:40:25 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[5/31/20, 5:47:34 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. As long as this one kid from last year doesn’t come it’ll be all good 😂

[5/31/20, 6:04:12 PM] Lore: Me voy a dormiuir Joe, un beso, 😘 disfruta de tu tarde

[6/1/20, 5:22:51 AM] Joe: You’re hella sweet. I miss talking to you too babe. I’ll be up in a few hours I’m sure haha. Ok I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soooon 😘

‎[6/1/20, 10:50:07 AM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[6/1/20, 10:54:03 AM] Lore: Hice ese audio mientras le preguntaba jaja para que escuches su acento, es cerrado no sé si se entiende pero le dije que tenía un amigo( vos) que decía "que palta" jaja y el empezó a repetirlo
[6/1/20, 10:58:01 AM] Joe: Hahaha I definitely noticed that part. His accent reminds me of some of the cartoon characters that are in those casi creativo videos 😂 Hard to hear him super well though.
[6/1/20, 10:59:45 AM] Lore: Jajaja a mí al principio me costó, muy cerrado
[6/1/20, 11:00:13 AM] Lore: Pobre lleva horas intentando instalarnos el wifi
[6/1/20, 11:01:28 AM] Lore: Se cayó de las escaleras y se raspó todo el brazo, que susto nos dió jajaja pobre con los guantes y la mascarilla trabajando le dije que podía quitársela
‎[6/1/20, 11:02:27 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/1/20, 11:03:07 AM] Lore: No podía parar de recordar este vídeo, jajaja tuve que buscarlo
[6/1/20, 11:03:44 AM] Joe: Hahaha woah 😱
[6/1/20, 11:04:25 AM] Lore: Jajaja no puedo parar de reír siempre que veo este vídeo, se ríe al final está bien
[6/1/20, 11:08:27 AM] Joe: I was a little worried at first until he started laughing hahah what a tumble
[6/1/20, 11:21:25 AM] Lore: No soy tan mala jaja, pero si suelo reírme bastante con caídas o cosas del estilo, (sin que se hagan daño)
[6/1/20, 11:31:04 AM] Joe: Ooooh then you would like some of my favorite Instagram pages hahaha
[6/1/20, 11:31:26 AM] Joe: https://instagram.com/americasgotnotalent?igshid=1heth6katuvvk

[6/1/20, 11:51:03 AM] Lore: Ah es que lo miré pero no salias en la lista de mis amigos
[6/1/20, 11:51:44 AM] Lore: Ah sí ahora sí jaja
[6/1/20, 11:53:40 AM] Joe: I’m glad you like those kind of videos. Some people don’t find it funny at all. I fall all the time and I still think it’s hilarious
[6/1/20, 11:55:42 AM] Lore: Jaja sí, siempre me entra risa cuando veo a alguien que se cae o hace algo torpe...intento no reírme por ver si se hizo daño.. pero me cuesta no hacerlo
[6/1/20, 11:59:40 AM] Lore: Aunque si veo que se hizo daño grave no me hace tanta gracia...me da pena
[6/1/20, 12:03:17 PM] Joe: Oh yeah of course! But I’m glad you find it funny when they’re not hurt. You’ll enjoy watching me skateboard in person, I fall a lot 😂
[6/1/20, 12:05:01 PM] Lore: Jajaja si podría reírme seguro
[6/1/20, 12:05:41 PM] Lore: Aunque hay una parte de mi que seguro estaría nerviosa por si te haces daño jaja
‎[6/1/20, 12:11:01 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/1/20, 12:11:59 PM] Joe: If we spend enough time together I’m sure you’ll see me hurt myself pretty bad eventually haha I’ve accepted that injuries are a part of skateboarding by this point
[6/1/20, 12:13:45 PM] Joe: Only 7 days until I leave this place 😩 

I hope California isn’t too fucked up when I get back haha. The Bay Area has definitely been torn apart
[6/1/20, 12:15:10 PM] Lore: Jajajaja era bastante previsible al verlo encima de la tabla
[6/1/20, 12:16:26 PM] Lore: Siii, lo sé jaja por lo que vi el skate es técnica y los trucos no salen a la primera asi que supongo que te caerás mucho jaja
[6/1/20, 12:17:52 PM] Lore: Ohhhh 7 días, cuáles son tus planes estos días? Espero ver alguna foto de alguna casita más antes de que te vayas jaja
[6/1/20, 12:20:22 PM] Joe: Hmmm I’ll probably just skate around a bunch. Go to the beaches near by. Just enjoy the week as much as I can. 

I’ll try to send more pictures haha

[6/1/20, 12:54:17 PM] Joe: Aún no. Voy a llamar por la tarde.
[6/1/20, 12:58:11 PM] Joe: I wanted to ask you something...I heard in a video that people say “voy a la calle” or “vamos a la calle” for saying they are going out or let’s go out(with no specific place in mind). 

Is that true? What do you say?
[6/1/20, 12:59:05 PM] Joe: For example, is “voy a ir a la calle a patinar” correct?
[6/1/20, 1:02:10 PM] Joe: I guess I could just just say it as “voy a patinar” to make it easy. But I still want to know if the other way is technically correct haha

[6/1/20, 1:34:59 PM] Joe: Haha cool. Gracias
[6/1/20, 1:35:22 PM] Joe: Well I did go skate but I didn’t make it far before my bearing broke so now my wheel doesn’t turn. Had to walk back
[6/1/20, 1:36:23 PM] Lore: Lo más usado sería que me digas " Lore, me voy a patinar a la calle un rato"
[6/1/20, 1:37:06 PM] Lore: Ohhhh
[6/1/20, 1:37:42 PM] Lore: Que putada!
[6/1/20, 1:39:18 PM] Joe: I was so close to making it back without anything breaking haha. The metal parts were getting rusty so it was only a matter of time I guess
[6/1/20, 1:39:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/1/20, 1:40:26 PM] Lore: Y no te podés comprar alguna pieza ahí? La podrás usar estos días y además te quedará de recuerdo jj
[6/1/20, 1:43:08 PM] Joe: Haha maybe I’ll have to see if the skate shop is open. 

Good thing I didn’t get too far before the wheel broke. That would’ve sucked.
[6/1/20, 1:43:26 PM] Joe: I have to write this down in my notebook haha
[6/1/20, 1:44:33 PM] Joe: Anytime you notice a phrase I would use with you often or one you would use all the time with me, tell me the right way and I’ll write it down haha
[6/1/20, 1:46:18 PM] Lore: Jaja menos mal! Bueno por lo menos pudiste patinar un poco
[6/1/20, 1:46:29 PM] Lore: Jajaj eso lo dirías mucho seguro
[6/1/20, 1:47:04 PM] Lore: Mmmm jaja
[6/1/20, 1:47:21 PM] Lore: "Me quedé dormido super temprano"
[6/1/20, 1:48:02 PM] Lore: " Me desperté demasiado pronto"
[6/1/20, 1:48:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[6/1/20, 1:48:17 PM] Lore: " voy a tomar un café"
[6/1/20, 1:48:29 PM] Lore: "Voy a hacer tortitas para desayunar"
[6/1/20, 1:48:41 PM] Lore: " voy a patinar de camino a la playa"
[6/1/20, 1:48:51 PM] Joe: Damn these are funny haha you don’t have to come up with them right away 😂 😂
[6/1/20, 1:48:57 PM] Joe: Hahah you have so many already
[6/1/20, 1:49:01 PM] Joe: Niiice
[6/1/20, 1:49:14 PM] Lore: Jajaja eso es todo lo que me decís siempre
[6/1/20, 1:50:03 PM] Lore: " soy tímido pero vos me sacaste de mi caparazón"
[6/1/20, 1:50:04 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/1/20, 1:50:08 PM] Joe: Well I guess I should switch it up. Surprise you hahah shit
[6/1/20, 1:50:39 PM] Lore: " soy un fumado, y la gente mayor me regala María por la calle"
[6/1/20, 1:51:04 PM] Joe: Oh god hahaha
[6/1/20, 1:51:06 PM] Lore: " me gusta todo tipo de música, no me juzgues"
[6/1/20, 1:51:43 PM] Lore: " voy a arreglar los errores de mi "estúpido" juego"
[6/1/20, 1:51:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck I can’t believe you still talk to me since these are the things I say
‎[6/1/20, 1:52:02 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/1/20, 1:52:08 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/1/20, 1:52:26 PM] Lore: " soy un friki de la política y me encanta Andrew Yang"
[6/1/20, 1:53:28 PM] Lore: " me gustaría construir una casita pequeña, tener un buen jardín y animales"
[6/1/20, 1:54:28 PM] Lore: "me gustaría tener hijos y ser cariñoso con ellos, ya que mi padre por momentos no lo fue conmigo"
[6/1/20, 1:54:38 PM] Lore: Nada es aburrido
[6/1/20, 1:54:59 PM] Lore: Me acuerdo bien de las cosas que hablamos jaja para que lo sepas!! ☝️
[6/1/20, 1:55:43 PM] Joe: Ok I didn’t think you’d have so many haha. This gets a new page in the notebook.
[6/1/20, 1:56:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you remembered a lot of stuff haha. I’m a little surprised
[6/1/20, 1:58:45 PM] Joe: Still need stuff you say to me all the time ...or stuff you would say all the time if we we’re in the same place for example. 

But this is a good start
[6/1/20, 2:02:06 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/1/20, 2:02:32 PM] Lore: Ah muy bien Joe, vos no t acordás de las cosas que yo te digo? Jaja
[6/1/20, 2:05:16 PM] Joe: Haha I remember things we talked about more than specific phrases. You are more unpredictable than me with 1000 more words 😂
[6/1/20, 2:09:44 PM] Joe: But I guess what I really want is phrases you would say often if we were together. Simple everyday stuff like asking if I can get you something or if I want to do some activity or go somewhere with you. 

Basic phrases that might be used daily. Maybe like something you would say to your roommates or friends often.
[6/1/20, 2:10:57 PM] Joe: Not now though haha. Just think about it and if you notice a phrase being used often throughout the day, even if it seems basic to you, tell me what it is. Then I can work on different responses
[6/1/20, 2:47:46 PM] Lore: Estaba cenando
[6/1/20, 2:48:10 PM] Lore: 😂
[6/1/20, 2:48:42 PM] Lore: Mmmm cosas cotidianas que te podría decir?
[6/1/20, 2:50:50 PM] Lore: Desayunamos juntos?
[6/1/20, 2:50:59 PM] Lore: Voy a preparar café, querés?
[6/1/20, 2:51:36 PM] Lore: Voy al super, te apetece que compre algo para cenar?
[6/1/20, 2:53:39 PM] Lore: Salgo a las 9, prepara algo rico para cenar porfi
[6/1/20, 2:53:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah those are good. Stuff like that. That way i can think about and practice different responses until it is more natural
[6/1/20, 2:54:35 PM] Lore: Estoy cansada, me hacés un masaje? Jaja esto es típico en mi, me encantan los masajes jaja
[6/1/20, 2:56:27 PM] Lore: Que tal dormiste esta noche?  Yo dormí poco, roncabas mucho 😂
[6/1/20, 2:57:09 PM] Lore: Las perras no hicieron caca, las voy a sacar un rato

[6/1/20, 3:02:59 PM] Lore: Jajaj roncas?
[6/1/20, 3:06:42 PM] Joe: I don’t think I snore a lot but sometimes I do haha. Usually if I’m sleeping in a weird position
[6/1/20, 3:18:03 PM] Lore: Jaja está bien saberlo!
‎[6/1/20, 3:18:36 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[6/1/20, 3:20:52 PM] Lore: Jaja que bonitas notas
[6/1/20, 3:23:19 PM] Lore: Estas son de las cosas que más me gustan de vos, la actitud y el interés
[6/1/20, 3:34:41 PM] Joe: Thanks hahah. I just want to learn fast so I can communicate with you effectively.
[6/1/20, 3:36:20 PM] Joe: Since I’m the kind of person that only talks to a few people, it is especially frustrating for me that my favorite person to talk to has the most barriers for communication haha
[6/1/20, 3:38:03 PM] Lore: Ohhh
‎[6/1/20, 3:41:18 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/1/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha Lo siento 😂
[6/1/20, 3:42:36 PM] Lore: Me refiero a que son bonitas , y solo me dan ganas de teletransportarte acá ahora jaja
[6/1/20, 3:44:07 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate it. I want to be with you so bad, but I’ll keep my mushy bullshit to a minimum so you can sleep haha
[6/1/20, 3:45:18 PM] Lore: Muy mushy bullshit jauaja
[6/1/20, 3:45:29 PM] Lore: My*
[6/1/20, 3:49:03 PM] Lore: La verdad es que me gusta que me digas esas cosas
[6/1/20, 3:49:34 PM] Joe: Haha I just tell you those things at the wrong time

[6/1/20, 4:15:12 PM] Joe: My hair is fucked up today. Ignore it hahahah
[6/1/20, 4:17:25 PM] Joe: The one day I don’t shower when I get back from skating and you’re asking for videos hahaha I look all ridiculous
[6/1/20, 4:17:25 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/1/20, 4:17:38 PM] Lore: El de tu padre 🤭😂
[6/1/20, 4:18:32 PM] Joe: Haha yeah that’s his Hawaii hat. He leaves it here for when he visits 😂

[6/1/20, 4:20:25 PM] Joe: Oh...I mean, go to sleep hahaha stop talking to me about random stuff 😂
[6/1/20, 4:20:54 PM] Lore: 🥺🥺🥺
[6/1/20, 4:21:42 PM] Joe: Haha I want to talk to you I’m just playing cause you said not to talk a certain way when you’re getting sleepy. I don’t want to keep you up
[6/1/20, 4:22:01 PM] Joe: Well...I do want to keep you up hahaha but if you’re tired I want you to sleep

[6/1/20, 4:26:34 PM] Lore: Por suerte soy rápida para dormirme, cuando decida en 10 min puedo estar super dormida...así que no t preocupes jaja mientras pueda hacerlo intentaré hablar con vos
[6/1/20, 4:26:34 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m sorry I just forget the time difference and start blabbering on about nonsense right around the time you should be going to sleep
[6/1/20, 4:27:47 PM] Joe: Haha nice. I feel like this is me too. I lay down and pass out super fast most of the time. I sleep so fast I need to be careful with getting to comfortable or I’ll fall asleep on accident 😂
[6/1/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: I’ve been trying to watch movies lately and I keep falling asleep hella early on the couch
[6/1/20, 4:28:52 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/1/20, 4:30:08 PM] Lore: Si es nuestra diferencia horaria, yo muchas veces me olvido y te mando mensajes en mi mediodía o algo así y al final los ves en tu madrugada .. también me siento culpable jaja
[6/1/20, 4:30:43 PM] Lore: Jajaja será difícil que veamos una peli juntos
[6/1/20, 4:31:51 PM] Joe: Hah why? Will you fall asleep too? Sounds great haha
[6/1/20, 4:33:06 PM] Lore: Jaja sí en el sofá me quedo dormida rápido
[6/1/20, 4:33:25 PM] Joe: Don’t ever feel bad. My sleep schedule is super random sometimes but I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a while and that’s when I see those messages. I don’t mind waking up to a message from you at all. Sometimes I feel bad for not being able to respond cause I was asleep haha
[6/1/20, 4:34:02 PM] Joe: Perfect. If we want to get a little nap we’ll just put on a movie and cuddle on the couch haha
[6/1/20, 4:34:13 PM] Lore: En el cine aguanto, pero sofá... Buuu jajaj no siempre. Puedo intentarlo
[6/1/20, 4:35:03 PM] Joe: I wouldn’t mind you falling asleep haha no biggie
[6/1/20, 4:37:33 PM] Lore: 🤗 jaja sí es que justo me pasa que cuando estás dormido quiero mostrarte algun video de perros o niños o algo jajaja y hay veces que lo envío
[6/1/20, 4:38:14 PM] Lore: Suena genial, ya estás perdiendo toda tu vergüenza ehhh ehh jajaj
[6/1/20, 4:39:43 PM] Joe: Send them all haha. I’ll let you know if it bothers me but I enjoy it so don’t expect me to complain

[6/1/20, 4:46:17 PM] Joe: Hahaha it’s the only way to know for sure. Ok I’ll try it with you one day. When you least expect it
[6/1/20, 4:46:25 PM] Lore: Aunque sigo viendo el gif jajaja es que son tan graciosos sus pasos 🤭
[6/1/20, 4:47:13 PM] Joe: Pure talent haha
[6/1/20, 4:48:18 PM] Joe: I hope you realize I’m hella goofy and really would do some shit like dance like an idiot just to make you laugh haha. Don’t be surprised when I do weird shit 😂
[6/1/20, 4:48:41 PM] Lore: Me hace tanta gracia lo ridículo que es con su pantalón de vestir, zapato y calcetín jajaja en su primer paso jjjj
[6/1/20, 4:49:42 PM] Joe: It’s the total commitment to the joke haha. So good. Classic
[6/1/20, 4:50:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja ya 🤭
[6/1/20, 4:51:31 PM] Lore: Mejor en directo! Así intentaras seducirme? Jajaja

[6/1/20, 4:53:56 PM] Joe: Are we strange for liking Mr Bean? Haha I think he is hella funny. I remember it being played in my families house when I was younger though so I may be biased
[6/1/20, 4:55:50 PM] Lore: Jaja sí en mi casa también lo veíamos, de hecho cuando sale por la TV y estamos con mi hermano, se ríe de la misma manera, a todos nos hace gracia jaja
[6/1/20, 4:56:19 PM] Lore: Mmm mi gorro preferido por como te queda es el primero
[6/1/20, 4:56:36 PM] Lore: Y... El marrón
[6/1/20, 4:57:26 PM] Lore: Perdón, gris!!
[6/1/20, 4:57:53 PM] Joe: Hahah these messages about the hat are so late 😂
[6/1/20, 4:58:00 PM] Lore: Aunque todos te quedan bien, los que mejor esos
[6/1/20, 4:58:23 PM] Lore: Jajajaja ya, pero seguía pensando que tenía que decirlo, no sé de qué empezamos a hablar y me olvidé
[6/1/20, 4:58:38 PM] Joe: Haha thank you my fashion expert
[6/1/20, 4:58:46 PM] Joe: Stylist haha
[6/1/20, 4:59:45 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. I appreciate the feedback. Then I can go out feeling confident cause you already confirmed the hat looks good on me
[6/1/20, 5:00:27 PM] Joe: Glad you didn’t pick my dads hat as your favorite hahaha. Not really my style 😂
[6/1/20, 5:02:12 PM] Lore: Jajaja

[6/1/20, 5:21:08 PM] Joe: I just want to be in the same space as you. I want to fall asleep with you. It sucks that it’ll take so long before I can make that happen
[6/1/20, 5:24:06 PM] Lore: Yo también quiero eso, de verdad. No puedo entender cómo lo deseo tanto jaja, es como basta, Lorena, está lejos
‎[6/1/20, 5:24:56 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/1/20, 5:27:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha aaah well not much I can do about it. All part of the journey I suppose. Might as well have fun with it, make a good memory from the time
[6/1/20, 5:28:46 PM] Lore: Pero bueno, me alegro de haber hablado hoy un buen rato con vos!
[6/1/20, 5:29:43 PM] Lore: Así que, gracias! 😘
[6/1/20, 5:31:28 PM] Joe: Haha no problem. I always enjoy our talks. But this time I’ll really let you go to sleep now 😂
[6/1/20, 5:32:22 PM] Joe: Tomorrow we can send more Mr Bean gifs and laugh about nothing haha
[6/1/20, 5:33:56 PM] Lore: Jajaj si me voy a dormir ya
[6/1/20, 5:34:35 PM] Lore: Me entró un dolor de cabeza super fuerte, tomé una pastilla a ver si para
[6/1/20, 5:35:23 PM] Joe: Damn that sucks. Imagine I’m massaging your head gently hahaha

[6/2/20, 5:20:15 AM] Lore: jajaja
[6/2/20, 5:20:36 AM] Lore: misma fecha de usa a españa, el doble
[6/2/20, 5:23:18 AM] Lore: I think it can be for two options. 1. The problem now with the death of the black boy. 2. Corona Virus, I looked at the embassy and says that visas cannot be requested until the pandemic ends, Spain being one of the most requested
[6/2/20, 5:24:18 AM] Joe: Hahaha what the hell? So like, that flight takes you to the US then flies back to Spain in the same day?
[6/2/20, 5:24:53 AM] Joe: Oh yeah I guess people might not be too excited to come to the US with all this crazy shit happening
[6/2/20, 5:26:24 AM] Lore: haha no no, I wanted to know why so cheap, and sent the same flight date, just change the origin and destination and it's double!
[6/2/20, 5:26:44 AM] Lore: Claro, yo creo que puede ser eso...
[6/2/20, 5:28:10 AM] Lore: You are asleep? jaja another nap?
[6/2/20, 5:30:36 AM] Joe: I fell asleep on the couch again haha. I woke up cause my stomach was kind of hurting so now I’m just laying here in bed

[6/2/20, 5:40:26 AM] Joe: I have an urge to eat something hot and tasty but I don’t have anything I can make quick that I can think of. 
I hate when I get this kind of urge late in the night haha.
[6/2/20, 5:44:17 AM] Lore: jajaja
[6/2/20, 5:45:01 AM] Lore: pobrecito, te prepararía algo!
[6/2/20, 5:47:03 AM] Lore: intenta descansar para no perder el sueño, y luego desayunas algo rico cuando te despiertes

[6/2/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: es el cumpleaños de mi hermana hoy y vamos a hacer estofado
[6/2/20, 4:00:50 PM] Lore: Decime algo con "pantuflas" así practicas

[6/2/20, 4:14:56 PM] Lore: Que decís de la playa?
[6/2/20, 4:16:25 PM] Lore: " no, no uso pantuflas en mi casa" para mí no hace falta y la casa sería con mi . Esto sería para decirlo bien, aunque yo te entiendo perfectamente como lo dijiste 😊
[6/2/20, 4:16:57 PM] Joe: I only use the kind you wear to the beach haha

[6/2/20, 4:30:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 4:30:35 PM] Joe: Hahha I talk to her on the phone almost everyday. She is rubbing off on me quick

[6/2/20, 4:32:13 PM] Joe: Don’t worry I’m sure when we are together your accent will rub off on me quickly too
[6/2/20, 4:34:18 PM] Lore: Jajaj eso espero
[6/2/20, 4:34:51 PM] Lore: Si es que te veo algún día o todo esto me lo inventé y no es verdad?
[6/2/20, 4:34:57 PM] Lore: Existís?
[6/2/20, 4:35:00 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 4:38:28 PM] Joe: Hahah what do you mean? I better see you someday soon
[6/2/20, 4:39:40 PM] Lore: Jajaja preguntas irónicas
[6/2/20, 4:41:50 PM] Lore: Pero lo pienso por momentos, sii esto es real... me parece tan raro todo lo que "construimos" en este tiempo jjj
[6/2/20, 4:45:08 PM] Joe: Haha I understand. I don’t know about you but It feels real to me. It’s definitely a surprise how much we’ve connected over this time but I’m happy about it
[6/2/20, 4:49:38 PM] Lore: Bueno, si hay cosas que ya sabés de miii. Más de lo que puedo hablar con un chico un día jaja
[6/2/20, 4:50:07 PM] Lore: Yo también estoy re feliz de que sea así!!!
[6/2/20, 4:54:11 PM] Joe: I still think this is hella funny. Especially after you sent me all the things I say often hahaha
[6/2/20, 4:54:43 PM] Joe: I just don’t understand what other dudes must be saying for me to keep you interested more than them 😂
‎[6/2/20, 5:34:44 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/2/20, 5:39:10 PM] Joe: Hah it’s late that’s ok.
[6/2/20, 5:39:31 PM] Joe: You get some sleep. You can always talk to me tomorrow
[6/2/20, 5:39:45 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, muchas cosas me contás jaja
[6/2/20, 5:40:00 PM] Lore: Me picaron unos putos mosquitos en el brazo
[6/2/20, 5:40:57 PM] Joe: Dude I have sooo many mosquito bites right now hahah. I don’t know where I was when I got so many
[6/2/20, 5:41:06 PM] Lore: Ups... Jaja 🙈 hubo una situación rara con esto
[6/2/20, 5:41:41 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 5:42:18 PM] Joe: Haha all good you don’t have to respond to that. I was just saying, i feel like I’m boring 😆
[6/2/20, 5:43:36 PM] Lore: Mmmmm
[6/2/20, 5:45:27 PM] Lore: Un "amigo" se enfadó conmigo por qué ya no le hablaba y me preguntó si había conocido a alguien
[6/2/20, 5:47:35 PM] Joe: Aaaah ok. Whoops 😬
[6/2/20, 5:48:30 PM] Lore: Le dije la verdad, que si, aunque era raro...
[6/2/20, 5:49:31 PM] Lore: Yo no podía mentirle, el no podía creer la distancia entre nosotros 😬
[6/2/20, 5:50:05 PM] Lore: No te asustes con esto que te cuento jaja, así que no, no me pareces aburrido
[6/2/20, 5:50:09 PM] Joe: Damn now I feel kind of bad haha
[6/2/20, 5:50:30 PM] Lore: ???
[6/2/20, 5:50:36 PM] Joe: I appreciate the honesty
[6/2/20, 5:50:44 PM] Joe: For him
[6/2/20, 5:52:11 PM] Joe: Cause yeah that must’ve been quiet the shock, especially after learning about the distance. 

But yeah, thanks for telling the truth haha
[6/2/20, 5:52:39 PM] Joe: Quite*
[6/2/20, 5:53:41 PM] Lore: 🤷
[6/2/20, 5:55:37 PM] Lore: No sé, es la verdad... No tengo ganas de ver a otros chicos ya
[6/2/20, 5:56:59 PM] Lore: Pero tu respuesta es que el te da pena 🙈
[6/2/20, 5:57:29 PM] Joe: https://open.spotify.com/track/3YdKJzcoMZMacISlpY4QoP?si=2WQP4oJkRl6CV5Pod56V7A
[6/2/20, 5:57:47 PM] Joe: Hahaha I feel like I should be nervous about you, wild girl
[6/2/20, 5:59:43 PM] Lore: Cómo? Jaja
[6/2/20, 6:01:44 PM] Joe: Haha nothing never mind. Don’t worry though I definitely am only interested in you. 100% all you
[6/2/20, 6:05:42 PM] Lore: Ay pero por qué decías eso, quiero entenderlo!
[6/2/20, 6:10:15 PM] Joe: Ok I’ll explain but don’t take it the wrong way because I love who you are as a person. Genuinely. 

You are a beautiful, free spirited, outgoing, funny girl and I sometimes I feel like I could be setting myself up for heartbreak here hahaha
[6/2/20, 6:11:38 PM] Joe: It’s less about me thinking you would do something inappropriate and more that I think I could end up liking you a little too much and get hurt for it. That’s life though, I either open up to you and see what happens or stay in my shell. The stay in the shell option might not be available to me anymore haha
[6/2/20, 6:16:25 PM] Joe: I never know if I explain these things well that’s why I say never mind 😂 I don’t know how to describe what I mean. I hope you get the idea
[6/2/20, 6:16:59 PM] Lore: Mmm
[6/2/20, 6:17:58 PM] Lore: Jaja no.. algo como que no me lo tomé a mal.. cosas buenas pero que si me gustas mucho podrías hacerme daño
[6/2/20, 6:19:29 PM] Lore: 🙈 jdkkfbkd
[6/2/20, 6:21:06 PM] Joe: Yeah I guess I’m just nervous about relationships in general. In that one video I sent you I told you I was planning on focusing on myself and wasn’t trying to talk to anyone like that. I don’t know how to describe it well
[6/2/20, 6:21:55 PM] Joe: I’m super glad I’m talking to you now. And I don’t want to stop or anything like that. I’m just saying that I wasn’t really expecting something like this
[6/2/20, 6:22:35 PM] Joe: I think the way previous relationships have ended make me a little guarded right now
[6/2/20, 6:26:07 PM] Joe: Fuck I really don’t want you to think anything negative about this cause it’s not like some huge deal, I’ve still been super open with you and share as much as I can. If any of that was too big of a deal for me I wouldn’t even be talking to you. It’s a small thing. I’m sure you feel a slight nervousness about getting hurt in the end as well but that’s the risk you take if you want to be with someone
[6/2/20, 6:27:33 PM] Lore: Mmm no tendría que haber sacado esta conversación
[6/2/20, 6:28:28 PM] Lore: Jaja por que no sé si estoy entendiendo bien las cosas
[6/2/20, 6:28:33 PM] Joe: Hahah fuck 3:30am 😬 I’m so sorry 😂
[6/2/20, 6:29:13 PM] Joe: You can respond to this tomorrow if you want. No worries
[6/2/20, 6:29:18 PM] Lore: Yo solo quería decirte que no me pareces aburrido que la muestra está en que no tengo ganas de conocer a otros chicos
[6/2/20, 6:29:48 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/2/20, 6:30:10 PM] Lore: Pero ahora me estás diciendo que podés hacerme daño, vos a mí? O algo de tus ex? Y que te da miedo?
[6/2/20, 6:30:11 PM] Joe: All good. I’m sorry I opened up too much. Ok ok maybe you should just go to sleep haha
[6/2/20, 6:31:00 PM] Joe: Haha it’s complicated. We can talk about it some other time. It’s not a huge deal at all. Don’t worry
[6/2/20, 6:31:38 PM] Lore: Me gustaría terminar de hablarlo ahora
[6/2/20, 6:32:16 PM] Joe: Ok. Hmm I don’t know how to explain it in simple terms.
[6/2/20, 6:34:24 PM] Joe: Haha why couldn’t you just accept “never mind” 😂
[6/2/20, 6:35:29 PM] Lore: Podemos dejarlo en no importa
[6/2/20, 6:35:56 PM] Lore: Y no hablaríamos ya...
[6/2/20, 6:36:13 PM] Joe: Hhahhha fuck
[6/2/20, 6:36:16 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/2/20, 6:37:01 PM] Joe: Ok I just had a bad breakup or two and I don’t want to go through that with you. I’m scared of having really strong feelings for you
[6/2/20, 6:37:39 PM] Joe: There isn’t much more to it than that
[6/2/20, 6:41:21 PM] Joe: At this point I can’t do anything about it cause I already really like you soooo
[6/2/20, 6:42:06 PM] Lore: Jaja mmm pero si te da miedo, no deberías plantearte en que alguno de los dos viaje para conocernos
[6/2/20, 6:42:59 PM] Joe: Ok 🙄
[6/2/20, 6:44:30 PM] Joe: Nah but for real...it’s not being nervous about being with you, it’s being nervous about losing you. I fucking hate sounding corny like that but that’s what it is
[6/2/20, 6:46:49 PM] Lore: Yo estuve 10 años con mi ex, luego con varios chicos pero nunca me dieron ganas de tomarlo en serio... Con vos no lo sé, pero cuando me planteabas la opción de conocernos en persona y demás detalles que tuviste, eso hizo que cambie mi chip
[6/2/20, 6:49:50 PM] Joe: This is why I shouldn’t tell you shit haha. I want to take it seriously with you, otherwise I wouldn’t be nervous at all. It wouldn’t matter. I’m sorry if what I’m saying is making you think I’m having doubts about trying to be with you because that’s not it
[6/2/20, 6:49:59 PM] Lore: Yo estaba genial soltera, pero ahora me siento atrapada por un chico que conocí durante la cuarentena y no puedo dejar de hablar con él o sonreír cuando veo algún video 😬😬😬
[6/2/20, 6:51:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I also was very ok with being single. But I would say you trapped me 😆
‎[6/2/20, 6:51:34 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/2/20, 6:51:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja si era mi objetivo
[6/2/20, 6:51:51 PM] Lore: Lo que no sabía es que yo quedaría ahí atrapada también
[6/2/20, 6:53:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha you were just going to message me until you lost interest but you couldn’t stop once you started 😂
‎[6/2/20, 6:53:17 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/2/20, 6:53:54 PM] Lore: Mmm algo así jajaja
[6/2/20, 6:54:55 PM] Joe: Good thing I didn’t speak Spanish and I have no idea how to talk to girls or you might have gotten bored by now
[6/2/20, 6:55:17 PM] Lore: Sé que todo es súper cursi, pero es algo diferente y me siento atraída por esta historia, y aunque no te conozca en persona puedo sentir la buena vibra a tantos km
[6/2/20, 6:56:54 PM] Lore: Yo de verdad no tenía intención de conocernos en persona, ya que era una locura.. pero vos empezaste a metermelo en la cabeza y no lo veo ya tan imposible
[6/2/20, 6:57:27 PM] Joe: You must be some kind of “hopeless romantic” haha. I like the story too and you got siiick vibes haha
[6/2/20, 6:59:30 PM] Joe: Haha damn sorry about that 😂 

I didn’t plan on it at first either. Honestly I was very skeptical about your reason for messaging me haha. But the more I talked to you the more I wanted to meet you.
[6/2/20, 7:00:09 PM] Joe: Then I started to think about it and there is nothing stopping me from making it happen, it’ll just take some time to get everything situated
[6/2/20, 7:00:45 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 7:01:12 PM] Lore: Entonces ahora no me podés decir que no nos vamos a conocer
[6/2/20, 7:01:58 PM] Lore: Eso me descolocaría otra vez mi cabeza jajaja, aunque lo tendría que aceptar
[6/2/20, 7:03:27 PM] Joe: Haha I’m not changing my mind on us meeting. That’s the goal right now.
[6/2/20, 7:05:04 PM] Joe: When I get back to the bay I’m going to go do everything to get my passport and by the time that comes I should be able to visit you
[6/2/20, 7:06:46 PM] Lore: Jaja espero que tus ex u otras chicas de bahía no se interpongan en que nos veamos jajaja
[6/2/20, 7:06:59 PM] Joe: I don’t even know what the plan would be. Like how long do I go and how it all works haha but I’ll figure it out.
[6/2/20, 7:07:45 PM] Joe: Hahah naaah I don’t think that’ll be a problem at all
[6/2/20, 7:07:46 PM] Lore: Jaja sí podés ir sacando el pasaporte jaja aunque nuestras fronteras están cerradas!
[6/2/20, 7:09:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja okey pinocho
[6/2/20, 7:09:19 PM] Joe: Hahahaha

[6/2/20, 7:10:03 PM] Joe: No soy pinocho.
[6/2/20, 7:10:41 PM] Joe: “I only have eyes for you” hahaha I just need summer to go by quickly so I can get to you. Things have to be open by then
[6/2/20, 7:11:37 PM] Lore: Jajaja
‎[6/2/20, 7:11:53 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/2/20, 7:12:13 PM] Lore: La voy a escuchar, antes estaba intentando entender todo lo que me contabas

[6/2/20, 7:15:11 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 7:15:33 PM] Lore: No pasa nada, todo bien. Aún no tengo que trabajar
[6/2/20, 7:16:04 PM] Lore: Solo desde casa y puedo tomar un café XL
[6/2/20, 7:16:35 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s true, no work. You’re going to be sleeping all day haha

[6/2/20, 7:18:26 PM] Joe: 😂 
You should’ve taken the “never mind” and gone to bed.
[6/2/20, 7:19:12 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok I’m going to shut up now
[6/2/20, 7:20:48 PM] Lore: Jajaja no podía ser así, yo te acababa de decir que no tenía ganas de conocer a otros y vos blablabla no quiero hacerte daño no te lo tomes a mal y yo pensando, que? 🙊👊
[6/2/20, 7:23:27 PM] Joe: Haha and me blahblahblah?? Damn I’m lame as fuck
[6/2/20, 7:24:13 PM] Joe: You probably thought I was saying I don’t want to meet you or something haha. Damn I bet all that sounded so weird when you read it
[6/2/20, 7:24:39 PM] Joe: Don’t get confused. I want to meet you and I’ll be very direct about it if that changes.
[6/2/20, 7:24:42 PM] Joe: But it won’t haha
[6/2/20, 7:25:23 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/2/20, 7:28:20 PM] Lore: Si algo así, pensé... mierda para que habré contado esto, se suponía que debía ser positivo para el y no darle pena el otro...ahora está asustado y yo no entiendo lo que me dice el puto traductor  jaja
[6/2/20, 7:29:58 PM] Lore: Fue culpa mía también por no entender bien jaja, te tocó explicármelo más, pobre pinochito!
[6/2/20, 7:30:11 PM] Joe: 😂 aaah I can only imagine what was going through your mind. That’s pretty funny hahah
[6/2/20, 7:31:43 PM] Lore: Jajaja 😬 y vos querías mandarme a la cama antes
[6/2/20, 7:31:51 PM] Joe: No big deal for me but it ended up keeping you awake for 2 more hours
[6/2/20, 7:32:25 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️
[6/2/20, 7:32:51 PM] Joe: I want you to get good sleep that’s all Hahahaha
[6/2/20, 7:33:00 PM] Joe: Now I kept you up all night

[6/2/20, 8:16:09 PM] Joe: Mmm yeah it’s hard for sure. Ugh why are you turning me on so much right now??
[6/2/20, 8:17:58 PM] Lore: Sabes que me gustaría?

[6/2/20, 8:36:31 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/2/20, 8:37:05 PM] Lore: Pff que duro ver esto y no poder hacer nada
[6/2/20, 8:38:01 PM] Joe: You started it with your hand dance and leg photo.
[6/2/20, 8:38:27 PM] Joe: Got me feeling the same way haha
[6/2/20, 8:38:27 PM] Lore: Lo sé, lo sé, lo siento!
[6/2/20, 8:39:19 PM] Joe: The sun is going to come up soon over there haha. I can’t believe how long you’ve stayed up
[6/2/20, 8:39:46 PM] Lore: Jaja es que no tengo nada de sueño
[6/2/20, 8:39:50 PM] Lore: Nadaaaa
[6/2/20, 8:40:05 PM] Lore: Estoy escuchando los pajaritos
[6/2/20, 8:40:43 PM] Lore: Y pensando las cosas que te haría si estuvieras acá 🤷
[6/2/20, 8:41:06 PM] Joe: Oh god if the birds are chirping it’s almost time for the sun for sure hahah
[6/2/20, 8:41:23 PM] Joe: Mmmm I would like to know more about this 🤔
[6/2/20, 8:42:42 PM] Lore: Me importan una mierda los pájaros y el sol ahora mismo 😂
[6/2/20, 8:45:01 PM] Lore: Mmm okey.. te soltaría el moño y te dejaría el pelo suelto... Te daría un buen beso en los labios y luego en el cuello jugando con el collar..
[6/2/20, 8:46:04 PM] Lore: Me pondría encima de vos, e iria dándote más besos por el pecho y barriga
[6/2/20, 8:46:34 PM] Lore: Y luego tocaría suavemente ese short azul
[6/2/20, 8:47:14 PM] Joe: Mmmmm fuck
[6/2/20, 8:48:57 PM] Lore: Te quitaría el pantalón para que te quedes desnudo, y luego me quitaría yo toda la ropa también. Los dos sin nada, solo el contacto de la piel .. la respiración..
[6/2/20, 8:49:50 PM] Joe: Mmm yes
[6/2/20, 8:50:15 PM] Joe: Hsjzkdneks fuck you make it sound sooo good I want you more than ever

[6/2/20, 9:07:20 PM] Joe: Ok I have to put this thing away. You enjoy that photo and video cause that’s all I’m sending today 😂
[6/2/20, 9:07:56 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/2/20, 9:08:19 PM] Lore: Gracias, me encanta
[6/2/20, 9:08:50 PM] Joe: Be careful or next thing you know I’ll be making the video request haha
[6/2/20, 9:09:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja es lo justo, me muero de la vergüenza también pero por vos lo haría
[6/2/20, 9:11:53 PM] Joe: 😮 oooh I’ll have to make some request in that case
[6/2/20, 9:12:19 PM] Joe: Not sure what to request though so maybe next time haha
[6/2/20, 9:12:26 PM] Lore: Ahora voy a dormirme un poco, aunque super tarde pero con buena sensación ... Hablamos un montón de cosas hoy, mucha mierda cursi y esto que no me lo esperaba para nada... Jaja no puedo creer lo que estamos haciendo tan lejos.. sin límites
[6/2/20, 9:13:21 PM] Joe: Hahah I had a lot of fun talking to you today and I’m glad we “explored” a little more.

[6/2/20, 9:14:18 PM] Lore: Buenas noches liiindo, 😘
[6/3/20, 12:01:58 PM] Joe: I just saw a mosquito in my room! I tried to kill it but I missed and now I can’t see it. Little fucker has probably been biting me for days!
[6/3/20, 12:16:36 PM] Lore: Buenos días!!!

[6/3/20, 12:24:39 PM] Joe: Haha yeah mosquito are terrible. That’s why I like those carnivorous plants. Nature’s mosquito trap haha
[6/3/20, 12:25:09 PM] Joe: I sleep pretty good. Didn’t fall asleep on the couch so that probably helped.
[6/3/20, 12:26:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja
‎[6/3/20, 2:33:05 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[6/3/20, 2:44:29 PM] Joe: Oooh it was good. I didn’t take many notes today. Just listened to Nelly talk about when she moved to the US in the 60s. Interesting stuff haha
‎[6/3/20, 2:48:39 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/3/20, 2:48:45 PM] Lore: Jaja a ver
[6/3/20, 3:07:40 PM] Joe: Haha yeah this was me today. All kinds of stuff about not speaking English, having to sit in the back of the bus, crazy neighbors
[6/3/20, 3:07:44 PM] Joe: Good stuff
[6/3/20, 3:08:51 PM] Lore: 😮
[6/3/20, 3:09:16 PM] Lore: Y ella te contó la historia en español?
[6/3/20, 3:16:16 PM] Joe: Yeah she tells me everything in spanish but when I don’t understand she can explain in English
[6/3/20, 3:17:02 PM] Lore: Contamelo en español entonces jjj
[6/3/20, 3:21:56 PM] Joe: Hmmm what to tell you 🤔
[6/3/20, 3:24:27 PM] Joe: Hahah I really don’t know what to tell you in spanish cause I didn’t write much down. I have a hard enough time translating it in my head. I can remember what she said but in my head it’s in english. I couldn’t tell you the exact phrases in Spanish unless I use the translator 🤦‍♂️
[6/3/20, 3:25:22 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno no pasa nada, no te preocupes
[6/3/20, 3:25:39 PM] Joe: I still don’t hear or understand every word so I can only piece together the idea of what is being said.
‎[6/3/20, 3:25:59 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/3/20, 3:27:06 PM] Lore: Jaja es normal, poco a poco. Tranqui jjj
[6/3/20, 3:29:32 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. I’ll get it down
[6/3/20, 3:30:13 PM] Joe: So what time did you wake up today? You stayed up helllla late haha. Sun was probably coming up as you went to sleep
‎[6/3/20, 3:52:15 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/3/20, 3:53:45 PM] Lore: Jajaj mierda que sombra en mi cara 🙈👻
[6/3/20, 4:03:36 PM] Joe: Haha I had to listen so many times! You didn’t nap?? I would have haha
[6/3/20, 4:03:38 PM] Joe: You should send videos or audio to me everyday until I don’t have to listen multiple times to understand hahah.
[6/3/20, 4:10:47 PM] Lore: Jaja
[6/3/20, 4:14:41 PM] Lore: Te decía que.. "si, me acosté super tarde y me desperté a las 9 de la mañana. Rogel el perro de mi amiga estaba llorando en mi puerta. Después vino otra amiga Carol y desayunamos café y tostadas. Después me puse con el curso de 3d y no dormí siesta, por último me di una ducha relajante y acá estoy"
[6/3/20, 4:16:48 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate the subtitles. I understood the ideas like waking at 9, the dog crying at the door, coffee and toast with your friends for breakfast, 3d course, no nap and shower haha
[6/3/20, 4:17:44 PM] Joe: I miss a bunch in between and I don’t hear a lot of the words but I kind of know what you say. Good to be able to read it so I can catch all the words
[6/3/20, 4:19:31 PM] Lore: Jaja sí hablé lo más lento posible, ahora que estoy relajada
[6/3/20, 4:21:48 PM] Joe: Yeah we’ll wait until I’m a little better at spanish before you send the videos after drinking coffee
[6/3/20, 4:22:19 PM] Joe: Oh god I can only imagine what it sounds like when you talk really fast. Blahblahblahblah I wouldn’t understand shit
[6/3/20, 4:23:26 PM] Lore: Jajajaja 🙈
[6/3/20, 4:26:25 PM] Lore: Intentaré hablarte lo más lento posible para que puedas entenderme
[6/3/20, 4:26:38 PM] Joe: If you spoke English it would be so easy for me to learn from you hahah. I feel like I can understand Nelly waaaaay better after a few weeks of talking almost everyday
[6/3/20, 4:28:19 PM] Lore: Jjj 🤷
[6/3/20, 4:28:39 PM] Joe: Now I really have to expand my vocabulary, because I’ll end up understanding most of a sentence but not knowing one or two words throws me off haha.  But I’m finally started to understand the basic rules I better
[6/3/20, 4:30:19 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno el vocabulario es más fácil, solo nos preguntas o lo buscas y ya esta 😊
[6/3/20, 4:35:30 PM] Joe: Sí, definitivamente es más fácil pero hay tantas palabras jaja
[6/3/20, 4:36:14 PM] Joe: Nunca termina
[6/3/20, 4:37:08 PM] Lore: Poco a poco, lo conseguirás!
[6/3/20, 4:38:26 PM] Lore: Bueno, me voy a dormiir

[6/3/20, 11:10:12 PM] Joe: Mmmm I’m going to take the dogs place haha so jealous
[6/3/20, 11:11:02 PM] Lore: Jajajaja 🤭

[6/3/20, 11:28:47 PM] Lore: 😂😂
[6/3/20, 11:30:30 PM] Lore: Cuál t gustó más de los que te envié? 🤠
[6/3/20, 11:34:04 PM] Joe: Mmmm it’s hard to pick a favorite haha I like the ones you just sent me. I always love the leg pictures 😂 

I don’t know. I like to see you so I enjoy all of them!
[6/3/20, 11:39:30 PM] Lore: Buenas respuestas bombón!

[6/4/20, 5:20:22 AM] Lore: Jajaj del sofá a la cama, buenas noches!
[6/4/20, 10:42:31 AM] Joe: I had a dream last night I was living with some people I didn’t know and they spoke spanish 😂 that was the first time anyone has spoke Spanish in my dream. So weird
[6/4/20, 10:52:30 AM] Lore: Buenos días rulitos, que dormido estabas eh jaja chinito
[6/4/20, 10:53:23 AM] Lore: Síii? Jajaja
[6/4/20, 10:53:43 AM] Lore: Contame!
[6/4/20, 10:54:10 AM] Lore: Que decían, vos hablabas también?
[6/4/20, 10:55:24 AM] Joe: All I remember for sure was they asked if I wanted to eat hahaha there was more but I can’t remember. I also don’t remember if I said anything
[6/4/20, 10:56:13 AM] Joe: Damn it was so much clearer when I first woke up haha I should’ve just put as much detail as I could in that first message.
[6/4/20, 10:56:53 AM] Joe: “Quieres comer algo?” Haha
[6/4/20, 10:57:13 AM] Joe: That’s all I can remember
[6/4/20, 11:00:19 AM] Lore: jajajajaç
[6/4/20, 11:02:35 AM] Lore: que gracioso, si por eso te pregunté rápido.. a mi me pasa que sueño o tengo alguna pesadilla, y si la cuento tarde, ya no tiene tanto sentido jaja
[6/4/20, 11:03:10 AM] Lore: el español se esta metiendo hasta en tus sueños!
[6/4/20, 11:07:00 AM] Joe: Hopefully spanish in my dreams is a good sign that I’m picking it up.
[6/4/20, 11:07:43 AM] Joe: It was so weird though. I was living with some family I didn’t know
[6/4/20, 11:07:44 AM] Joe: Damn
[6/4/20, 11:07:51 AM] Joe: I thought it was coming back to me ahaha
[6/4/20, 11:09:17 AM] Joe: Hhmmm there was an older lady, and a younger man 🤔 she was at a table, the room was small and kind of dark, didn’t feel like a house you find in the US
[6/4/20, 11:10:01 AM] Joe: Shit that’s all I got. I’m going to write it down next time right when I wake up if it happens again.
[6/4/20, 11:10:51 AM] Lore: jajajaja
[6/4/20, 11:11:26 AM] Lore: booludo, no tiene muy buena pinta ese sueño y ese lugar
[6/4/20, 11:12:08 AM] Lore: por lo menos te ofrecían comida! jjj
[6/4/20, 11:12:33 AM] Lore: mierda, en un sitio en español y yo no estaba allí!
‎[6/4/20, 11:13:30 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 11:14:11 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve had a dream about you I just didn’t tell you 🙊🙈
[6/4/20, 11:16:40 AM] Lore: 😯😯
[6/4/20, 11:16:50 AM] Lore: por quee? jaja contamelo ya!!!
[6/4/20, 11:17:09 AM] Lore: espero que no sea malo 🙉
[6/4/20, 11:19:34 AM] Joe: Haha no it wasn’t bad. I can barely remember anything that happened in the dream now cause that was about a week ago. All I really remember is we were together. It was a good dream
[6/4/20, 11:21:39 AM] Lore: ohhh, me lo tendrías que haber contado!!! buuu
[6/4/20, 11:22:12 AM] Lore: pero me alegro mucho que lo hagas una semana después jaja y que estuviesemos juntos!
[6/4/20, 11:24:27 AM] Joe: Haha I didn’t want to seem weird and message you all excited that I had a dream about you 😂
[6/4/20, 11:26:31 AM] Lore: joder Joe, raro sería si no te hiciese caso... jaja obviamente si es alguien que no me interesa, me daría exactamente igual que sueñe conmigo
[6/4/20, 11:27:26 AM] Lore: pero de vos no! todo lo contrario!
[6/4/20, 11:29:19 AM] Joe: Alright well if I have another dream and you’re in it, I’ll let you know haha

[6/4/20, 11:32:38 AM] Lore: vaya fumada llevo, me encanta la música

[6/4/20, 11:36:08 AM] Lore: jaja es todo lo contrario, la noche y el día,e l sol y la lluvia
[6/4/20, 11:37:12 AM] Joe: Hahah true
[6/4/20, 11:38:28 AM] Joe: It’s so weird how we live in such different places. You’re so fucking far 😂
[6/4/20, 11:39:32 AM] Joe: I still don’t believe it sometimes how far you are. Never would I have imagined being in this situation
[6/4/20, 11:40:16 AM] Lore: jaja yo tampoco, no lo hubiese imaginado para nada y me cuesta creer como pasó
[6/4/20, 11:42:37 AM] Lore: principalmente, porque cuando te encontré y me respondiste, y empezamos a hablar, en mi cabeza estaba clarísimo que nunca te conocería ... y ahora.. pff jaja lo que más quiero es conocerte, me da igual donde sea ya

[6/4/20, 11:48:50 AM] Lore: jaja dónde?
[6/4/20, 11:48:56 AM] Lore: sabés lo que pensé yo?
[6/4/20, 11:49:56 AM] Joe: Haha I don’t know where these places are but they look nice
[6/4/20, 11:50:35 AM] Joe: What?
[6/4/20, 11:51:42 AM] Lore: yo pensé en los sitios que más nos gustan, pero depende la fecha
[6/4/20, 11:52:16 AM] Lore: pero más que un sitio exacto, pensé que si hacemos un viaje podríamos alquilar una furgoneta para dormir, o una autocaravana
[6/4/20, 11:52:53 AM] Lore: jaja no sé, solo me gustó la idea de no encerrarnos en un hotel o en una casa
[6/4/20, 11:53:59 AM] Joe: Haha that sounds fun to me.
[6/4/20, 11:54:05 AM] Joe: Tell me all the ideas you come up with.
[6/4/20, 11:54:53 AM] Lore: dormiste alguna vez en una furgo? es genial, podés aparcar donde quieras y despertarte con buenas vistas! cocinar algo simple, etc
[6/4/20, 11:55:06 AM] Joe: I mean I’m down to try it out. I have a friend that lives in a van with his dog and has a YouTube channel hahaha
[6/4/20, 11:56:00 AM] Lore: sii? jaja me cae bien tu amigo entonces!
[6/4/20, 11:56:36 AM] Joe: No I haven’t. I wanted to try it for a while but I never did. 

In the end i decided if I’m going to live like that I’d build one of those tiny houses on wheels
[6/4/20, 11:57:32 AM] Joe: But with you I’d be fine with trying it in a van or motor home Haha keep it simple
[6/4/20, 12:00:33 PM] Joe: Van or motor home is way better for actually moving around often but I always wanted to build something like the houses on this page. 

If you end up not talking to be and I become an old single dude I’ll build one for myself and go live off grid hahah

[6/4/20, 12:02:58 PM] Lore: jajaja si, ví varios proyectos de tiny houses! un profesor hacía diseños y siempre me mostraba jaja
[6/4/20, 12:03:38 PM] Lore: https://www.instagram.com/p/B7g4-hOBW2N/
[6/4/20, 12:04:02 PM] Lore: esta de la página que me acabas de pasar... aaaarg!
[6/4/20, 12:05:13 PM] Joe: I love how some of the designs look. Like full size house shrunk down
[6/4/20, 12:06:24 PM] Lore: https://www.instagram.com/p/CAMJeQZndnY/
[6/4/20, 12:06:35 PM] Lore: y mira esta que bonitaa, además tiene jardin para huerto, etc
[6/4/20, 12:06:42 PM] Joe: I did a lot of research on building a super tiny house haha. It’s so cool cause you can spend money on really high quality material since you don’t need as much material to build small.
[6/4/20, 12:07:12 PM] Joe: Probably cost between $40,000-60,000 to build a really nice tiny house
[6/4/20, 12:08:18 PM] Joe: Ooh that one is nice. The hardest part is finding land to park your house on but damn I hella want one 😂
[6/4/20, 12:08:25 PM] Lore: claro!!! lo único depende de donde este por el clima, tema de aislamiento y demás! pero son geniales
[6/4/20, 12:09:03 PM] Lore: jajaja me encanta que nos guste lo mismo!
[6/4/20, 12:09:36 PM] Lore: la marihuana me esta haciendo imaginar que vivimos en unaaa, con un huerto y perros
‎[6/4/20, 12:10:47 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 12:10:48 PM] Lore: puedo aprender a diseñar webs y vos las desarrollas jaja, sumado a nuestro canal de Youtube jajaja
[6/4/20, 12:11:54 PM] Joe: Hahah if we built a tiny house and lived in the middle of nowhere with some dogs our YouTube channel would be great
[6/4/20, 12:12:19 PM] Lore: pero nuestra vida mucho mejor! jajaja
[6/4/20, 12:12:34 PM] Joe: Hahahah so embarrassing but I was definitely going to film the process of building the house and make a channel about the house
[6/4/20, 12:13:15 PM] Joe: Hahah yes. It would be perfect
[6/4/20, 12:13:54 PM] Lore: jajaja auténtico influencer de Youtube
‎[6/4/20, 12:14:41 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 12:14:57 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[6/4/20, 12:14:59 PM] Joe: Shit

[6/4/20, 12:16:45 PM] Lore: jajajjaa te intento "picar"/ "molestarte" sé que no sos así...
[6/4/20, 12:18:15 PM] Joe: Hahah you try to “push my buttons” 😂 I’m pretty sure I told you that before.
[6/4/20, 12:18:42 PM] Lore: creo que una plataforma como Youtube es genial, se pueden ver muchísimos videos de gente que tiene pensamientos interesantes o que construye cosas así, y su intención es solo compartirlo.. muy diferente a la parte negra de Youtube, de gente superficial, egocéntrica que quiere likes o dicen cosas sin sentido
‎[6/4/20, 12:18:47 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 12:18:59 PM] Lore: jajajaja
[6/4/20, 12:20:06 PM] Lore: jajaja siempre, me divierteeee ... jaja a mis amigas siempre que puedo las pico con algo!
[6/4/20, 12:20:19 PM] Joe: Very true. That’s why I like YouTube. For almost every topic you can find people sharing information just because they want to share it.
[6/4/20, 12:21:21 PM] Lore: siiim luego hay chicos que suben videos de skate, enseñando como poner una lija... o explican algo sentados en el suelo, mientras vuelan una botella de agua jajajaja
[6/4/20, 12:22:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha still roasting me 😂
[6/4/20, 12:24:24 PM] Joe: I have fun making videos so it’s whatever. It’s always a little bit embarrassing when people find them but it’s just me doing things I like to do and saying things I know so it shouldn’t be a big deal.
[6/4/20, 12:25:04 PM] Joe: For me that is. It shouldn’t be a big deal for me
[6/4/20, 12:26:05 PM] Joe: But you can poke fun. I enjoy your button pushing. I’m just saying, making stuff like that is weird in the way that you put yourself out there for people to judge you
[6/4/20, 12:27:04 PM] Lore: eyyyy es solo una broma!
[6/4/20, 12:27:58 PM] Joe: Hahah I know i know
[6/4/20, 12:28:01 PM] Lore: no es para burlarme de vos negativamente.. ni mucho menos
[6/4/20, 12:28:12 PM] Joe: No biggie
[6/4/20, 12:29:11 PM] Lore: si te dije que me gustaban, son caseros y naturales.. de todos modos, es verdad.. cuando publicas algo te expones a que la gente opine, de manera positiva o negativa
[6/4/20, 12:29:34 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry I know. I’m just saying what I’m thinking. I don’t take it negatively from you at all. I know you like them and you joke with me in a caring and fun way.
[6/4/20, 12:29:50 PM] Lore: hay a chicas que les encanta una chica explicando durante 1 hora un maquillaje, yo la critico.. aunque intento no cruzarme con esos videos jajaja
[6/4/20, 12:33:37 PM] Joe: I’m just glad you’re not a girl that is obsessed with those kind of videos haha
[6/4/20, 12:34:59 PM] Joe: I watch so much random shit I can’t judge what other people watch though 🤷‍♂️

[6/4/20, 2:08:28 PM] Lore: Yo tomo cerveza con choco también jaja
[6/4/20, 2:16:35 PM] Joe: Hahah damn you really enjoy your beer 😂 that’s cool though. All these things sound strange to me but if you like it, I won’t judge haha
[6/4/20, 2:17:03 PM] Joe: I never would’ve thought to try those combinations haha
[6/4/20, 2:18:32 PM] Lore: Jaja boludo 🙈

[6/4/20, 2:19:34 PM] Lore: Si me gusta, así soy.. jaja
[6/4/20, 2:20:48 PM] Lore: La tomo cuando estoy cocinando, o tengo un día estresante o bien algo alegre , y mientras ceno me tomó una y luego como me queda un poco hay veces que el postre (algo de choco).. lo combino con lo último que me quedó de cerve
[6/4/20, 2:22:50 PM] Joe: Haha all good. If that’s what you like it’s fine with me.
[6/4/20, 2:24:04 PM] Joe: As long as you’re not as drunk as Tokyo in that one episode when Rio comes back. Hahaha i was watching it yesterday, super drunk spanish sounds hilarious
[6/4/20, 2:25:31 PM] Joe: I also realized the hardest character for me to understand is Denver. I don’t know why, maybe he just talks the fastest or something but can never understand him
[6/4/20, 3:52:24 PM] Lore: 😊☺️😚
[6/4/20, 3:53:27 PM] Lore: Jajaj nooo. Eh yo tomo cerveza en casa a diario pero sanamente, y luego si salgo también pero ahí un poquito más ... El punto de ,"contenta" no borracha!
‎[6/4/20, 3:54:30 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/4/20, 4:00:26 PM] Lore: Estas viendo la casa de papel otra vez?
[6/4/20, 4:02:16 PM] Joe: Hahah I believe you. I just would love to go out and spend some time with “content” you 😂
[6/4/20, 4:03:44 PM] Lore: Mmm Denver si es más cerrado, el tiene como un acento "macarra, chico duro" mezcla como alguien de barrio cerrado
[6/4/20, 4:03:46 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m watching it again. I can understand more this time but what I do is I’ll watch it and if there is an interesting scene I watch it once with spanish subtitles to know what words they’re using, then again with English subtitles while listening for the words I read the first time. It’s a weird way to study haha
[6/4/20, 4:04:34 PM] Joe: I feel like the subtitles don’t match what he says a lot of the time. Or at least more often than the other characters
[6/4/20, 4:05:51 PM] Joe: Like he was in the bathroom and said he didn’t hear anything. Sounds like he says “escucho nada” but the subtitles were like “no .. ... oido”
[6/4/20, 4:06:47 PM] Lore: Genial, estás currandotelo rulitos!
[6/4/20, 4:07:49 PM] Lore: Ah sí??  Cualquier cosa que dudes, decimelo y te lo explico
[6/4/20, 4:08:27 PM] Lore: 🤨🤔😂
[6/4/20, 4:12:45 PM] Lore: Que raro, si ves esa parte u otra pásamela y te digo si es un error
[6/4/20, 4:13:13 PM] Joe: Hah I’m missing some filler words that the subtitles had but I listened to it so many times cause I was like, “no way he is saying that” haha
[6/4/20, 4:13:50 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure I will
[6/4/20, 4:13:59 PM] Lore: Mmmmmm
[6/4/20, 4:14:13 PM] Joe: I can never understand Denver though. It’s so weird.
[6/4/20, 4:14:21 PM] Lore: Sisi pasamelas o cualquiera que quieras, estaré encantada en ayudarte
[6/4/20, 4:14:43 PM] Lore: Si es que el habla muy rápido y cerrado

[6/4/20, 4:25:14 PM] Lore: España tiene un montón de lugares lindos, y diferentes!
[6/4/20, 4:25:19 PM] Joe: Haha ok what do you have in mind?
[6/4/20, 4:26:00 PM] Lore: El norte es pura naturaleza, aunque el clima es lluvioso pero por eso es tan verde
[6/4/20, 4:26:40 PM] Lore: Luego el sur hace mejor tiempo, hay playitas lindas y arquitectónicamente es lindo con influencia árabe
[6/4/20, 4:26:40 PM] Lore: Luego están las ciudades como Madrid y Barcelona
[6/4/20, 4:26:44 PM] Joe: Green is my favorite color haha and I love nature
[6/4/20, 4:26:57 PM] Lore: Y luego islas canarias e islas baleares
[6/4/20, 4:27:01 PM] Lore: Todo esto en España
[6/4/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: South sounds interesting too haha
[6/4/20, 4:27:16 PM] Lore: Luego cerca tenemos Portugal que es súper barato y lindo, y Marruecos!!!
[6/4/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha you’re going to induce analysis paralysis with all these options 😂
[6/4/20, 4:29:41 PM] Joe: I can only stay for 90 days unless I apply for some kind of visa or something right? I’ll have to get all that figured out and we need to narrow down a plan haha shit is complicated

But Spain sounds cool to me. I’d be super down to move there for a while
[6/4/20, 4:33:50 PM] Lore: jajaja es que tuve antes paralisis de análisis durante la cena y mis compañeras me ayudaron
[6/4/20, 4:34:01 PM] Lore: jajaja 🤭
[6/4/20, 4:36:06 PM] Lore: mientras estaba tomando una cerveza dije que igual podía irme a California, Hawaii, Peru, Costa Rica, Indonesia, etc.. jajaja y ellas me aconsejaron todos los sitios buenos que hay en España, Portugal, Italia, Marruecos, etc...
‎[6/4/20, 4:38:16 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 4:38:41 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/4/20, 4:40:12 PM] Joe: So many options haha maybe instead of picking just one you can make a list and we can live in each place until we find our favorite haha
[6/4/20, 4:41:20 PM] Lore: jajaja Joeee, te estoy hablando en serio!
[6/4/20, 4:42:20 PM] Lore: vivir en todas es imposible jaja, escucha pero a vos que te gustaría?
[6/4/20, 4:45:00 PM] Lore: yo en Madrid ahora estoy trabajando.. y estaré un tiempo más por la casa.. aunque podría tener unos 20 días de vacaciones si sigo en el mismo trabajo
[6/4/20, 4:48:24 PM] Joe: Is it impossible? I mean...we’re not THAT old haha and it’s not like we have to spend 10 years in each place or anything. Few years here few years there you know?
[6/4/20, 4:48:52 PM] Joe: In the future hahah
[6/4/20, 4:49:08 PM] Joe: But for now I don’t know, whatever works for you. I’ll go wherever
[6/4/20, 4:49:17 PM] Joe: Doesn’t matter too much to me where I am
[6/4/20, 4:50:45 PM] Joe: Spain sounds cool and like it has a wide variety of places. But whatever we can make work is where I’m going haha
[6/4/20, 4:52:13 PM] Joe: You pick the place and I’ll just meet you there
‎[6/4/20, 4:55:17 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha shit
[6/4/20, 4:56:42 PM] Lore: Si, suena genial lo de vivir en varios sitios, jaja pero entonces vas a venir? algún sitio tendrás interés en conocer no?
[6/4/20, 4:57:02 PM] Lore: ajjaja no podés dejarme elegir solo a mi, después de haberme enseñado ese video, jajaja
[6/4/20, 4:58:42 PM] Lore: vas a venir a España entonces de vacaciones? podemos ir a esos sitios en una furgo o a las islas, los vuelos son baratos.. fuera de temporada igual unos 50eu ida y vuelta
[6/4/20, 4:59:48 PM] Lore: okey, me callo.. jaja
[6/4/20, 5:00:09 PM] Lore: cuando empiezo con el analisis y las preguntas no puedo parar jajaja
[6/4/20, 5:00:18 PM] Joe: Haha don’t shut up
[6/4/20, 5:00:36 PM] Joe: It’s all good
[6/4/20, 5:02:14 PM] Joe: Hmm it’s hard to describe but i really don’t mind too much the location as long as I have the necessities. And it would matter even less if I was with you.
[6/4/20, 5:02:59 PM] Joe: If the place is new to me it’s an adventure either way and I want to know all different kinds of places in the world
[6/4/20, 5:04:34 PM] Lore: jaja me encanta lo "loco" que estas
[6/4/20, 5:05:14 PM] Lore: bueno, si finalmente llegas a venir... te intentaré llevar a sitios diferentes, y pondré en la lista varios skateparks de camino
[6/4/20, 5:05:46 PM] Lore: Barcelona me habias dicho que si querías conocer
[6/4/20, 5:08:07 PM] Joe: Haha sweeeet. You’ll be my tour guide 😂
[6/4/20, 5:09:14 PM] Joe: I’ll be back in California in a few days and then I can actually start the process of getting everything setup to go
[6/4/20, 5:13:55 PM] Lore: 😊😊😊
[6/4/20, 5:15:55 PM] Lore: Geniaal!
[6/4/20, 5:17:45 PM] Lore: intentaré no ilusionarme demasiado por si no lo haces finalmente jaja
[6/4/20, 5:18:21 PM] Lore: tu familia que va a decir, que viajas a europa por primera vez?
[6/4/20, 5:20:13 PM] Joe: I better make it there haha shit. 

I don’t know what my family will say. I’m sure they’ll be excited
[6/4/20, 5:22:53 PM] Lore: jaja eso es bueno!
[6/4/20, 5:32:47 PM] Joe: So no one has told you it’s a bad idea to meet me yet? Your brother must know about me, cause I saw him look at my Instagram story one time 😂 

What does he say?
[6/4/20, 5:36:08 PM] Lore: de verdadddd?
[6/4/20, 5:36:24 PM] Lore: jajaja quec cotilla mi hermano!!!

[6/4/20, 5:40:17 PM] Lore: jajaja sii, fue cuando puse eso del juego, el entro a ver las stories jjjjj
[6/4/20, 5:41:03 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s when he saw mine. They couldn’t help themselves
‎[6/4/20, 5:41:46 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 5:42:04 PM] Lore: jajajaja muy gracioso
[6/4/20, 5:42:11 PM] Lore: me dan ganas de volver a ponerles una trampa
‎[6/4/20, 5:42:54 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/4/20, 5:43:39 PM] Joe: I wonder what they thought when they look at our pages haha
[6/4/20, 5:45:13 PM] Lore: jajaja ahora entiendo todo
[6/4/20, 5:46:54 PM] Lore: yo a mi madre le dije que estaba practicando inglés, pq tenía un nuevo amigo.. ella empezó a intentar sacar información y le terminé contando que estabas en Hawaii, pero que vivias en California y que tenías parte de familia peruana pero que no hablabas español ..solo eso recuerdo que le conté
[6/4/20, 5:49:24 PM] Joe: Haha you told your mom? What’d she say? She just wanted all the info and that’s it?
[6/4/20, 5:49:26 PM] Lore: y el otro día cuando fui a la sierra, me hicieron una broma mi hermano y mi madre.. y me dijeron... eh ehhhh el equilibrio? jajaj y yo que?? y mi madre empezó a hacer un movimiento con los brazos de equilibrio como si patinase.. y dije.. como saben? no puede ser... jaja Gastón, vos estuviste mirando algo?? y me dijo no no lore, fue mamá... que dice que lo encontró por casualidad en tu perfil... jajaa hijo de puta... fue el!!!!
[6/4/20, 5:50:10 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[6/4/20, 5:50:14 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/4/20, 5:50:32 PM] Lore: si, mi madre sabe inglés.. pero yo no aproveché la oportunidad de aprenderlo.. por eso le conté que ahora si estaba leyendo inglés jajaja y ella quería saber más de la cuenta
[6/4/20, 5:53:03 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I told Nelly haha she was just like “oooh that’s nice” haha But I didn’t tell her much except that “I have a friend that lives in Spain that I talk to and she only speaks Spanish”
[6/4/20, 5:53:42 PM] Joe: The rest of my family can find out when I have my plans to visit you more figured out
[6/4/20, 5:54:10 PM] Joe: Now I want to know what my brother thinks haha shit
[6/4/20, 5:55:01 PM] Lore: jaja si vos sos más reservado que yo, a mi se me escapa y lo termino contando...
[6/4/20, 5:55:20 PM] Lore: tenés que contarle a Nelly la historia, necesitamos saber su opinión jajaja
[6/4/20, 5:56:35 PM] Lore: Tu hermano no sabía nada de nada no? el si que estará más confundido... jaja
[6/4/20, 5:57:12 PM] Joe: 😂 alright I’ll tell her and see what she says haha
[6/4/20, 5:58:07 PM] Joe: No he didn’t know anything haha. Probably looked at your page so confused.
[6/4/20, 5:58:23 PM] Joe: It’ll all make sense to him in the end haha
[6/4/20, 6:00:07 PM] Lore: si, el podía mirar solo el perfil las fotos, pero fue más curioso y miró las stories también, el habrá pensado "una chica que habla español y vive muy lejos jugando al juego de mi hermano? mmm"
[6/4/20, 6:02:11 PM] Joe: Haha for real that’s the part that gets me. He was so curious he had to click the story 😂
[6/4/20, 6:10:16 PM] Lore: jjj
[6/4/20, 6:10:32 PM] Lore: que hacesss? mandame un video antes de dormirme! jaja
‎[6/4/20, 6:16:26 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[6/4/20, 6:17:12 PM] Joe: I have to get my suitcase out so I can pack and I have to tidy up the room haha Buenas noches 😘
[6/4/20, 6:27:08 PM] Lore: Gracias, jaja buena tarea hacer la maleta..estarás entretenido!  buena tarde para voss, yo me voy a dormir ya! 😘
[6/5/20, 11:58:07 AM] Joe: Holaaaaaa
[6/5/20, 11:58:26 AM] Joe: Only 3 more days left here 😢
[6/5/20, 12:05:31 PM] Lore: Buenos días para vos!
[6/5/20, 12:05:47 PM] Lore: Ohh, jaja qué tal ya tenés la maleta preparada?
[6/5/20, 12:16:20 PM] Joe: Almost. It’s mostly packed but I have a few things out to wear for the next few days.
[6/5/20, 12:16:59 PM] Joe: I found out I have some kind of training for the skate camp next week so I start work the day I get back instead of a week later. Throwing off all my plans haha
[6/5/20, 12:20:00 PM] Lore: 👏
[6/5/20, 12:21:22 PM] Lore: Nooo.. jaja que putada! El mismo día? Cuáles eran tus planes justo al volver?
[6/5/20, 12:24:30 PM] Joe: I was hoping to use my free time in the first week back to find a place to stay and start on my passport stuff
[6/5/20, 12:27:42 PM] Joe: I get back on Monday night around midnight and have to be at work Tuesday morning haha. Shit
‎[6/5/20, 12:38:58 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/5/20, 12:40:10 PM] Lore: Uhhh, jajaja los niños estarán deseando que vuelvas.. seguro que te lo pasas bien aunque estarás un poco cansado 😅
[6/5/20, 12:40:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[6/5/20, 12:41:02 PM] Joe: I wish haha. It’s for training so it’ll be super boring all day meetings
[6/5/20, 12:42:50 PM] Lore: Jajaja pensamiento positivo
[6/5/20, 12:43:16 PM] Lore: Te podrás agarrar una nueva tabla y mientras entrenan.. vos estrenas el nuevo patín jjjj
‎[6/5/20, 12:44:32 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/5/20, 12:45:25 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[6/5/20, 12:48:20 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully I can find some time to go pick a new skateboard up. If not I can get it over the weekend
‎[6/5/20, 12:56:24 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
‎[6/5/20, 1:03:36 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/5/20, 1:05:04 PM] Joe: Looks like it’s starting to get back to normal slowly. Lots of people.
[6/5/20, 1:05:34 PM] Joe: Haha what did you get for her?
[6/5/20, 1:14:02 PM] Lore: Esto es nada para la gente que hay normalmente, pero después de estar acostumbrada a ver a poca, hoy ver a tanta me agobió un poco
[6/5/20, 1:14:52 PM] Lore: Un vestido, un top, un jersey.. jaja ropa es lo que más le gusta. Pero tuve que hacer colas para entrar, menos mal que iba con música!
‎[6/5/20, 1:16:36 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/5/20, 1:18:11 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/5/20, 1:19:16 PM] Joe: Ah yeah I guess I’ve never seen it at normal levels. But compared to when you first started going out, it’s pretty busy haha
[6/5/20, 1:19:48 PM] Joe: That’s nice of you. Yeah good thing you had the music with you haha.
[6/5/20, 1:20:31 PM] Joe: I’m trying to draw a new design for my portfolio but I can’t come up with any good ideas. I’m trying to do the mobile phone design first then I’ll make another for bigger screens.
[6/5/20, 1:22:01 PM] Lore: A ver, enseñamelo,!
[6/5/20, 1:22:50 PM] Lore: Te ayudo si puedo en algo!
[6/5/20, 1:24:38 PM] Joe: Hahaha nooooo not yet. I don’t even have anything yet. I just started and I can’t draw shit haha
[6/5/20, 1:25:04 PM] Lore: Jaja yo ya me lo imagino
[6/5/20, 1:25:11 PM] Lore: 🙄
‎[6/5/20, 1:27:08 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[6/5/20, 1:28:13 PM] Joe: Super simple sketches first then I’ll probably try to make it in a program like Adobe XD before coding it up. Going to go through the whole process this time haha. I kind of just went straight to coding the last version, that’s probably why it sucks haha
[6/5/20, 1:29:51 PM] Joe: I suck at designing stuff haha fuck
[6/5/20, 1:30:12 PM] Joe: My brain just loves to come up with ugly stuff haha
[6/5/20, 1:30:30 PM] Lore: Jaja
[6/5/20, 1:30:53 PM] Lore: Bueno recién empezaste a pensarlo
[6/5/20, 1:31:03 PM] Lore: Me dejas ayudarte? Jaja
[6/5/20, 1:32:29 PM] Joe: Haha totally! I welcome your help.

[6/5/20, 4:01:17 PM] Lore: Jajaja avanzaste!
[6/5/20, 4:02:32 PM] Lore: Jaja el final ñaaaa jajaj como el chino d ronronear jajaja
[6/5/20, 4:04:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha dammit 😂
[6/5/20, 4:05:21 PM] Joe: Yeah I got a little bit done. I don’t know if I like it. Probably should draw another. Then I need to draw what it would look like on a bigger screen before I make the prototype in Adobe XD or figma.
[6/5/20, 4:05:31 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/5/20, 4:05:50 PM] Joe: Hahahah whoops
[6/5/20, 4:06:35 PM] Lore: Que eliminaste?
[6/5/20, 4:09:59 PM] Joe: Hahaha audio clip

[6/5/20, 4:19:47 PM] Lore: Estoy viendo el video
[6/5/20, 4:22:02 PM] Joe: The one of my crappy sketch? Its terrible haha. I should practice sketching designs more often
[6/5/20, 4:27:30 PM] Lore: jaja si, estoy pensando
[6/5/20, 4:27:39 PM] Lore: noo, esta bien! se entiende, esta todo ordenadito jjj
[6/5/20, 4:33:34 PM] Joe: It’s a start haha. This will be the third time I try to design my portfolio. The one I showed you was version 2.
[6/5/20, 4:34:27 PM] Joe: jmvcode.com

This was the original one I made which I also hate hahaha
[6/5/20, 4:36:52 PM] Lore: mejor el violeta, este primero no me gusta mucho jaja 🙊🙈
[6/5/20, 4:37:41 PM] Joe: Don’t worry I hate the first one so much. I don’t even know why I made it like that haha. But that’s why I made the second one
[6/5/20, 4:39:37 PM] Lore: jaja los primeros son los peores, pero siempre se van cambiando cosas para mejorar, lo ves con otro ojo..
[6/5/20, 4:41:44 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s an iterative process
[6/5/20, 4:42:08 PM] Joe: Just have to keep trying different things until I get an idea of what works and what doesn’t
[6/5/20, 5:02:07 PM] Lore: mmmmmmm

[6/5/20, 5:40:45 PM] Joe: You’re the fucking best!! Hahaha
[6/5/20, 5:40:48 PM] Joe: Damn
‎[6/5/20, 5:40:54 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/5/20, 5:41:53 PM] Joe: You’re good at that. Not even using the right tools and still make a nice looking design haha
[6/5/20, 5:42:09 PM] Joe: I would love to see what you could make if you used actual UO design tools
[6/5/20, 5:42:25 PM] Lore: nahhh.. no se, solo estoy probando con lo que sé que es photoshop jaja
[6/5/20, 5:43:24 PM] Joe: Haha oh for sure I’m just saying, your stuff looks good and without the right tool so it’d probably look fairly professional if you ever use the other tools in the future
[6/5/20, 5:44:01 PM] Joe: But you did a pretty good job haha way better than me. Thank youuu
[6/5/20, 5:44:59 PM] Lore: hacemos equipo futuro marido? jajaja
[6/5/20, 5:46:23 PM] Lore: la ipografía que elegí es una finita, minimal.. se llama Corbel .. queda bien en light y a lo mejor en bold, Hi y Joe
[6/5/20, 5:46:29 PM] Joe: Hahah siiii
[6/5/20, 5:46:37 PM] Lore: *tipografía
[6/5/20, 5:47:33 PM] Joe: Alright cool. I’ll use that font
[6/5/20, 5:48:18 PM] Lore: creo que tanto la descripción, como tenías en tu portfolio, hola, soy Joe, bienvenido.. y la foto con la gorra si la pones en blanc y negros. estas dos cosas, podrían quedar más informales pero simpáticas
[6/5/20, 5:49:39 PM] Lore: luego abajo, se puede separar con recuadros, a lo mejor se puede poner solo 3 y contacto con estética diferente ... o quitar stacks y añadirlo en about me al final con los iconos
[6/5/20, 5:50:06 PM] Lore: luego un detallito a la derecha, con recuadro blanco y letra negra como home.. podría quedar más completo
[6/5/20, 5:51:12 PM] Lore: mmm no sé
[6/5/20, 5:52:12 PM] Joe: Haha thanks design master
[6/5/20, 5:52:14 PM] Joe: So many tips
[6/5/20, 5:52:45 PM] Joe: I like the idea of removing the stack section and adding it to the about me
[6/5/20, 5:53:29 PM] Joe: Black and white is probably a good idea too and I’ll take a picture with another hat soon haha
[6/5/20, 5:54:16 PM] Lore: jjajaja 🙈
[6/5/20, 5:54:46 PM] Lore: decime más que se te ocurran y podemos ir probandolo con photoshop
[6/5/20, 5:55:42 PM] Lore: jajaja math
[6/5/20, 5:55:55 PM] Joe: Haha no math for the next photo
[6/5/20, 5:56:39 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll let you know if I think of any other ideas.
[6/5/20, 5:56:49 PM] Lore: esa es mi foto preferida jaja
[6/5/20, 5:57:45 PM] Joe: Haha the math one? That’s good to know 😂
[6/5/20, 5:57:54 PM] Joe: I like that hat 🧢
[6/5/20, 5:58:18 PM] Joe: But like you said, the hat is political so not great for a portfolio haha
[6/5/20, 6:02:45 PM] Lore: si, en esto coincido con lo que me contaste
[6/5/20, 6:03:00 PM] Lore: no no, politica para portfolio no es buena idea
[6/5/20, 6:03:10 PM] Lore: decía foto preferida la que puse en la cascada
[6/5/20, 6:03:29 PM] Lore: jaja esa foto fue por la que te hablé
[6/5/20, 6:06:20 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[6/5/20, 6:06:47 PM] Joe: You talked to me thanks to my dude Andrew Yang 😂

[6/5/20, 6:15:21 PM] Joe: I like it
[6/5/20, 6:15:34 PM] Joe: Me gusta mucho or something haha
[6/5/20, 6:16:23 PM] Joe: Well it’s definitely better than what I was thinking of

‎[6/5/20, 6:19:50 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/5/20, 6:20:05 PM] Lore: jajaja con todas las capas desordenadas, me pregunto como será ese programa de diseño
[6/5/20, 6:21:31 PM] Joe: From what I remember...much easier than that hahaa that looks complicated
[6/5/20, 6:22:17 PM] Joe: Or like a lot of unnecessary layers compared to how you build them with Adobe XD or Figma
[6/5/20, 6:23:11 PM] Lore: 😬😬
[6/5/20, 6:23:36 PM] Lore: jaja bueno, ya lo cerré por que si no, yo no voy a parar de retocarlo jaja
[6/5/20, 6:24:28 PM] Lore: lo guardé por si algun día querés que le demos un poco más de forma
[6/5/20, 6:25:28 PM] Joe: Haha thank you I really appreciate the work you put into that. Another design for your web design portfolio 💼
[6/5/20, 6:26:19 PM] Lore: de nada rulitos!
[6/5/20, 6:29:52 PM] Joe: Your sleep schedule is crazy right now haha you better get back on track before going back to work
[6/5/20, 6:30:57 PM] Joe: Staying up late and helping me with my portfolio design is hella sweet though 😘
[6/5/20, 6:35:33 PM] Lore: jaja si, normalmente me acostaba a las 12, pero con la cuarentena mi horario cada vez era más tarde, y ya cuando te conocía  vos, se fue a la mierda jajaja
[6/5/20, 6:37:00 PM] Lore: pero bueno, aún no estoy trabajando... cuando lo este y no pueda quedarme hasta tarde supongo que me echaras algo de menos jaja
[6/5/20, 6:38:01 PM] Lore: jj no estoy cansada, y hace días dije que te iba a ayudar...tuve un momento de creatividad aunque sea tarde... jaja
[6/5/20, 6:41:30 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s going to be weird figuring out our new schedules haha
[6/5/20, 6:42:01 PM] Joe: And getting used to talking at different times
[6/5/20, 6:45:28 PM] Lore: 🤷
[6/5/20, 6:45:48 PM] Joe: You’ll just slowly forget about me 😂
[6/5/20, 6:46:51 PM] Joe: Taaaarde 

Me pudri te olvidaste de mi
[6/5/20, 6:47:08 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/5/20, 6:49:51 PM] Lore: No lo creo, auunque... si me insistis en que me olvidaré de vos y me mandas a dormir cada vez que es tarde... Mmm jaja no sé
[6/5/20, 6:53:04 PM] Joe: Hahah we might miss a few days of talking here and there but it’ll be hard to forget when I’m making my plans to meet you
[6/5/20, 6:53:54 PM] Joe: And I only tell you to sleep cause I feel bad keeping you up all night
‎[6/5/20, 6:58:00 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/5/20, 6:59:05 PM] Lore: jaja vale, no lo haré más!! esta la última 😊
[6/5/20, 7:00:39 PM] Joe: Mmmm....never mind haha
[6/5/20, 7:01:20 PM] Joe: Haha I can’t lie, even though I feel bad keeping you up I’ll miss talking to you as much as we do now.
[6/5/20, 7:02:32 PM] Lore: no me lo explicas?
[6/5/20, 7:05:36 PM] Joe: I was trying to say there will probably be days we don’t talk because we’re too busy
[6/5/20, 7:06:55 PM] Joe: But that’s ok, I think it’s understood it’ll be a little more difficult. I’m still going to come visit you haha
[6/5/20, 7:09:04 PM] Lore: Ahh ahora sí gracias
[6/5/20, 7:10:17 PM] Lore: Si puede ser.. bueno me voy la cama! Un beso 😘

[6/6/20, 10:24:41 AM] Joe: Aaaaah I need to do something today. Last weekend here. It’s all wet and cloudy and my skateboard is broken though 😞
[6/6/20, 10:31:38 AM] Lore: It's okay to get out of the comfort zone ✌️cloudy days have their charm too, taaake a bike or walk.. and enjoy the time you hace left! ✨
[6/6/20, 10:32:25 AM] Lore: *Have
[6/6/20, 10:38:37 AM] Joe: Yeaaah that’s true. I’m sure I’ll find something to do today
[6/6/20, 10:52:05 AM] Lore: I was watching the movie "the notebook", I don't know if you know it and what kind of movies you like exactly. Not to me the romantic ones, but this is special .. today I decided to see it again, after about 10,000 times haha, I was pausing and pointing out silly but useful phrases
[6/6/20, 10:59:51 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ve heard of that movie. Never saw it though. What kind of phrases did you get from the movie?

[6/6/20, 11:25:24 AM] Joe: I understood all of your English phrases. Very good
[6/6/20, 11:27:40 AM] Joe: You wrote down so many phrases. I love it 😂
[6/6/20, 11:33:37 AM] Lore: jajaja venga, se más duro conmigo.. seguro que hay muchas cosas que digo mal, cual es la que mejor y cual la que peor? jajaja
[6/6/20, 11:34:08 AM] Lore: si, son frases que podré usar con vos jaja
[6/6/20, 11:40:57 AM] Joe: Hahaha they seriously sounded good. The only one I notice anything is, “I’ll call you later.” Sounded like you said, “I call you later”.
[6/6/20, 11:43:22 AM] Joe: Yeah those are good ones haha it’s going to be so funny when we meet and only have some random phrases to communicate 😂
[6/6/20, 11:47:16 AM] Lore: graciasss
[6/6/20, 11:47:59 AM] Lore: jajajaja ya boludo
[6/6/20, 11:48:43 AM] Lore: pero imagina que vivieses en Madrid y fueses sordo, tendría que aprender lenguaje de signos jaja
[6/6/20, 11:49:41 AM] Joe: If I lived in Madrid you would not be interested in me hahaha you love the distance
[6/6/20, 11:50:32 AM] Lore: seguro que fumamos un porro, y decimos alguna frase más que esas básicas.. pero ehhh.. básicas pero utiles jaja

[6/6/20, 1:45:17 PM] Joe: Regional content is whack. I would just use a VPN but I watch Netflix on the smartTV with my sisters account haha So I can’t use one
[6/6/20, 1:45:56 PM] Lore: Ah siiii
[6/6/20, 1:46:45 PM] Lore: Jajaja es verdad un amigo argentino me instaló una cosa de VPN, una IP de Europa
[6/6/20, 1:48:20 PM] Joe: VPNs are useful sometimes haha. I have one that lets me change the country anytime. They don’t have servers in Spain but they do have servers in lots of countries nearby

[6/7/20, 12:31:24 PM] Joe: Same same but different, as they say haha
[6/7/20, 12:31:53 PM] Joe: Now if we could actually be in the same place instead of same environment that’d be great.
[6/7/20, 12:48:42 PM] Lore: Jaja
[6/7/20, 12:48:58 PM] Lore: Buuu eso sería genial, pronto!!!
[6/7/20, 1:01:29 PM] Joe: Yeah the time will come before we know it. Feels like I just got here and already tomorrow is the day I leave. Time flew by

[6/7/20, 1:22:29 PM] Lore: Si mañana empiezo, a las 4... Estoy preparada pero sin ganas jajaja
[6/7/20, 1:26:03 PM] Lore: *Sii tengo ganas pinocho ( lo escribí dos veces jaja 🤭)

[6/7/20, 1:27:46 PM] Joe: It’s at 1 o’clock. It got changed again so now I have one less layover.
[6/7/20, 1:28:55 PM] Joe: I feel you. I have to do that meeting the morning I wake up when I get back. Right back to Bay Area life haha
[6/7/20, 1:29:12 PM] Lore: Genial!!! A la 1 del mediodía no? 13:00hs

[6/7/20, 1:32:00 PM] Lore: Y a que hora llegas a Cali?

[6/7/20, 1:33:20 PM] Lore: Trabajarás muchas horas?
[6/7/20, 1:34:17 PM] Joe: 11:30pm California time
[6/7/20, 1:35:01 PM] Joe: Yeah the schedule is a mess but it’s ok. I get paid to go to the meetings so can’t complain too much
[6/7/20, 1:36:06 PM] Joe: I don’t know. The camp might be cut down to shorter hours. Still 5 days a week though. We’ll see how it goes.
[6/7/20, 1:40:08 PM] Lore: Jjj que cambio después de 6 meses!!
[6/7/20, 1:40:13 PM] Lore: Tenés ganas de volver??
[6/7/20, 1:41:36 PM] Lore: Echas de menos a tu familia y amigos?
[6/7/20, 1:41:46 PM] Lore: Y patinar en los sitios de tu ciudad
[6/7/20, 1:42:58 PM] Joe: Mmmm I feel like going back for some things but not for others haha. Yeah like my friends and family that are there. It will be nice to see them. 
And skating in the cities is definitely more fun haha but I didn’t mind being without that too much.
[6/7/20, 1:43:31 PM] Joe: I’ll be looking forward to when I can get back to Hawaii. I’ll come back eventually. Need to do some more stuff first haha
[6/7/20, 1:44:44 PM] Lore: Jaja por qué cosas no te dan ganas de volver?
[6/7/20, 1:45:37 PM] Lore: Viendo tu Ig me imaginé que echarias muchísimo de menos patinar ahí , mmm bien, no sos un obsesionado jajaj
[6/7/20, 1:48:04 PM] Joe: I could still skate here so it wasn’t a big deal. Lots of stuff I like skating near by.
[6/7/20, 1:48:12 PM] Lore: Volver a Hawaii? Jajaja nooo noo antes acá eh!!!!
[6/7/20, 1:48:17 PM] Lore: 😂
[6/7/20, 1:48:54 PM] Joe: But I like the vibe out here in Hawaii compared to the Bay Area.  And less people haha
[6/7/20, 1:49:40 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I’ll make sure to go to you first
[6/7/20, 1:50:31 PM] Lore: Pura vida

[6/7/20, 1:52:35 PM] Lore: La vibra de la gente que vive en una isla es diferente. Acá en España también, " los canarios" gente de islas canarias .. tienen muy buena onda.. sonrisas, sin prisas, amables
[6/7/20, 1:53:20 PM] Lore: Esooooo eso.. España no es Hawaii pero intentaré hacer algo para remediarlo jj

[6/10/20, 2:10:35 PM] Joe: I didn’t understand what you were saying at first haha. But yeah the shop is pretty big. They actually own another store across the street that only sells shoes. And that blue house is actually a coffee shop with apartments above it haha

[6/11/20, 2:42:21 PM] Lore: Today was not a productive day for me, I tried to do things but I got frustrated ... and I was a little low spirited! But I tried to solve it, I did yoga, I smoked a little, I took a long shower ... and wanting to do things tomorrow that make me feel satisfied..
[6/11/20, 2:51:20 PM] Joe: Yesterday was all about COVID and the new procedures for keeping everything clean. Washing hands and when to wear gloves and masks.
[6/11/20, 2:52:40 PM] Joe: Aw that sucks. I’m sorry. Yoga and a smoke sounds nice right now compared to this meeting haha. Hopefully tomorrow will be better

[6/12/20, 12:34:31 PM] Joe: Haha that sounds like an interesting situation. Helping a couple that can’t agree on anything seems like it would be awkward 😆

[6/12/20, 9:41:47 PM] Lore: Si, yo también..pero además del horario quería dejarte tiempo para estar en tu ciudad con tu gente, si hablabas conmigo no podías disfrutar tu llegada .. pero echo de menos hablar con vos 😭
[6/12/20, 9:42:02 PM] Joe: Don’t even worry about it. Message me anytime. I have my phone on silent at night too so it’s not a problem. I like to wake up to your messages
[6/12/20, 9:43:35 PM] Joe: Haha I miss talking with you too and I appreciate you thinking about my time since I just got back. I had fun spending time with my friends this week and start work next week.
[6/12/20, 9:45:10 PM] Lore: Lo mismo digo! Yo también tengo el teléfono en silencio, si lo veo pronto es por qué me despierto al baño o no puedo dormir

[6/12/20, 9:49:25 PM] Joe: I still love when you send little videos of yourself or photos haha
[6/12/20, 9:50:27 PM] Joe: But I’m here anytime you want to talk. About anything, if you have a bad day, good day, just woke up...message me whenever you have something to say.

[6/13/20, 9:27:45 AM] Joe: Hahaha good I’m glad you got more sleep. I felt a little bad keeping you up when I know you’d usually go back to sleep that early

[6/13/20, 12:22:41 PM] Lore: Eyy estaba trabajando

[6/13/20, 3:44:47 PM] Joe: Hahah sorry to bombard you with videos all at once
[6/13/20, 3:45:47 PM] Joe: He has a gold “grill” haha. It’s removable
[6/13/20, 3:46:24 PM] Lore: Yo te dije que me envies, así que tranqui
[6/13/20, 3:46:52 PM] Lore: 😬😬
[6/13/20, 3:46:54 PM] Joe: Yeah a lot of people living in the streets. That’s just one of the many camps around the city
[6/13/20, 3:51:04 PM] Lore: Y patinaron y luego hubo alguna concentración o algo?
[6/13/20, 3:52:44 PM] Joe: Yeah we ended at city hall and skated there for a while. I think the skate was about 6-7 miles so everyone was hella tired by the time we got to city hall
[6/13/20, 3:54:41 PM] Lore: Uhh
[6/13/20, 3:55:11 PM] Lore: Jaja tus piernas hoy 🥴

[6/13/20, 3:59:20 PM] Lore: Bueno pero es una buena manera de manifestarse, y patinando todo el mundo hacia el mismo lugar
[6/13/20, 4:03:17 PM] Joe: Yeah it was good. Now it’s time to eat. Going to go barbecue with my friends. Try and get some energy back haha.
[6/13/20, 4:04:19 PM] Lore: 👏👏👏
[6/13/20, 4:04:55 PM] Lore: Disfrutaaa, y tomate alguna cerve por mi jaja

‎[6/13/20, 9:29:30 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/13/20, 9:57:33 PM] Joe: Haha no socks. I’m at my other friend Alex’s house.
[6/13/20, 9:58:06 PM] Joe: But his dogs are a little scared. They don’t like the fireworks
[6/13/20, 11:49:07 PM] Lore: Es verdad
[6/13/20, 11:49:42 PM] Lore: Estaba medio dormida
[6/13/20, 11:58:58 PM] Joe: Haha that’s ok. I don’t mind if you wait until the morning to respond to me. If you wake up in the night and check my message it’s totally chill if you wait to respond. I just wanted to send you videos. 

No pressure to respond when you’re half asleep haha
[6/14/20, 12:00:19 AM] Joe: I just got home 20 minutes ago but I’ll probably be falling asleep soon over here. Super tired and sore from a long day of skating.
[6/14/20, 12:02:07 AM] Lore: Jaja yaa, hay veces que no me acuerdo lo que digo
[6/14/20, 12:02:54 AM] Lore: Aunque hoy no sé por qué me desperté a las 6 y me costó dormir estaba mirando unas cosas de costa rica en Instagram 🙈
‎[6/14/20, 12:05:07 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/14/20, 12:05:11 AM] Joe: Ooooh boy haha. Still dreaming of that island life
[6/14/20, 12:05:52 AM] Lore: Jaja gracias por los videos, descansaaa, good night 😘
[6/14/20, 12:06:32 AM] Lore: Si jaja, al ver la vida de amigos que conocí ahí no puedo creer que este viviendo en una ciudad jaja
[6/14/20, 12:07:44 AM] Joe: You’ll get back to the tropical life one day I’m sure haha
[6/14/20, 12:08:37 AM] Lore: Si yo también estoy casi segura jaja
[6/14/20, 12:09:41 AM] Lore: A dormiiiiir muchachito!! Muak 😘
[6/14/20, 12:10:40 AM] Joe: Alriiiiight if you say so haha 🤷‍♂️

[6/14/20, 7:39:11 AM] Lore: Jaja hubo telepatíaaa, te mandé este gif pero vos justo 5min antes le diste like a mi Ig, me acabo de dar cuenta
[6/14/20, 7:40:36 AM] Joe: Hahaha that always happens. I just got up a little while ago. I figured you were at work or something
[6/14/20, 7:42:06 AM] Lore: Jaja y que haces despierto tan pronto?
[6/14/20, 7:43:27 AM] Lore: Si estoy en el evento, muy tranquilo. Solo tres azafatas al lado, demasiado pesadasss blablabla con voz aguda 🤯
[6/14/20, 7:43:38 AM] Joe: Absolutely nothing. I’m getting hungry but I’m being too lazy to get up haha
[6/14/20, 7:44:52 AM] Joe: Haha that sounds unpleasant
[6/14/20, 7:45:11 AM] Lore: Jajaja como yo esta noche
[6/14/20, 7:45:43 AM] Lore: Si, no entiendo cómo son tan pesadas y hablan de cuando eran pequeñas y jugaban a las barbies
‎[6/14/20, 7:46:11 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/14/20, 7:51:38 AM] Joe: Hahaha what the hell? That’s so weird 😂
[6/14/20, 7:52:09 AM] Joe: Now it sounds even more unpleasant than before. Good luck with that haha
[6/14/20, 7:55:23 AM] Lore: Gracias Joeee
‎[6/14/20, 7:56:34 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted

[6/14/20, 8:00:18 AM] Lore: Jaja me encantaría tener un botón y ponerlas en mute
[6/14/20, 8:02:27 AM] Joe: You definitely need that. Is everyone in the same spot all day or do you move around the event at all?
[6/14/20, 8:03:57 AM] Lore: Cada uno esta en su propio espacio, ya que vienen los visitantes y hay que explicar el diseño
[6/14/20, 8:04:36 AM] Lore: Ellas se ponen ahí en una esquina por qué están aburridas, yo también. Pero sus conversaciones son muy aburridas
[6/14/20, 8:05:07 AM] Lore: Preferiría hablar con un chico que está ahora en el otro lado del mundo, a ver si tengo suerte y hace que se me pase me ayuda con este aburrimiento jajaja
[6/14/20, 8:08:52 AM] Joe: 😂

[6/14/20, 8:09:53 AM] Joe: That sucks you have to stay in that zone though. Can’t run away.

[6/14/20, 8:16:16 AM] Lore: Jajaja se puede tener más cara de dormido? No
[6/14/20, 8:17:00 AM] Lore: Jajaj me gusta! No la juzgo!! Este es el que hizo el diseño de los dados?
[6/14/20, 8:19:43 AM] Joe: No this is another friend of mine. He makes clothes as a little side gig type of thing. He is the one I was trying to convince to use my e-commerce website I was building
[6/14/20, 8:20:21 AM] Joe: He is taking forever to give me all the things I need to complete it for him though
[6/14/20, 8:26:22 AM] Lore: Sii me acuerdo, que bien a ver si te lo manda
[6/14/20, 8:26:44 AM] Lore: Igual mientras si no tenés muchos trabajos podés ir inventandote algunos para practicar y tener más portfolio
[6/14/20, 8:36:04 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s true. I need more projects in the portfolio for sure. Maybe I should work on that a little bit today.
[6/14/20, 8:38:23 AM] Joe: Damn tomorrow I start camp. Going to be a little strange with all the extra stuff we have to do. Hopefully since it’s only half days we can mostly skate outside and not have to worry too much.
[6/14/20, 8:39:56 AM] Joe: They had all kinds of rules for cleaning things before and after they get used, social distancing, when to wear mask and/or gloves
[6/14/20, 8:42:11 AM] Lore: 💪
[6/14/20, 8:42:47 AM] Lore: Ya odio la mascarilla, no me deja respirar bien .. pero es obligatoria en todos los sitios
[6/14/20, 8:43:05 AM] Lore: Excepto cuando estás en una terraza de bar, jaja sin sentido
[6/14/20, 8:43:34 AM] Lore: En realidad acá guantes no se llevan, gel con alcohol cada vez que tocas algo
[6/14/20, 8:44:20 AM] Lore: Lo bueno es que estarás al aire libre, como es? Enseñas un truco y los chicos los repiten? Jajaja o como?
[6/14/20, 8:46:05 AM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/14/20, 8:46:10 AM] Joe: haha sorry
[6/14/20, 8:46:17 AM] Joe: didn't mean to send that
[6/14/20, 8:46:43 AM] Lore: 🙄
[6/14/20, 8:47:06 AM] Joe: I think i only need gloves for when kids are getting to camp. I check them in and have to take their temperature and ask a bunch of questions every morning
[6/14/20, 8:47:25 AM] Lore: Que era? Jaja
[6/14/20, 8:48:06 AM] Joe: Yeah pretty much. We get everyone into groups by skill level and teach tricks and how to skate the park better in general
[6/14/20, 8:48:23 AM] Joe: how to utilize the ramps better and all that
[6/14/20, 8:49:14 AM] Joe: I'm on my computer and i accidentally hit send halfway through typing a sentence haha
[6/14/20, 8:51:07 AM] Lore: Jaja chusma
[6/14/20, 8:51:30 AM] Lore: Clarooo, que edades tienen los chicos? Y cuántos son?
[6/14/20, 8:51:56 AM] Lore: Aunque muchas veces los mayores son peores para hacer caso a las reglas
[6/14/20, 8:52:57 AM] Lore: Divertido, sé que en algún momento si quiero entonces tendré profe? Jaja
[6/14/20, 8:53:22 AM] Joe: I think it's 7 to 14 year olds. And we get a maximum of 12.
[6/14/20, 8:55:27 AM] Joe: Of course hahaha i'm an fairly decent teacher of skateboarding i think 😂
[6/14/20, 9:08:40 AM] Lore: Que chiquis con 7 añitos jjj . Cuáles te gustan más? Chicos o grandes?
‎[6/14/20, 9:10:24 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/14/20, 9:11:08 AM] Joe: Hmmmm I like the older ones but we don’t get many
[6/14/20, 9:11:39 AM] Joe: We get more girls than we do boys between 10-14
[6/14/20, 9:12:09 AM] Lore: Jaja claro más divertido mayores
[6/14/20, 9:12:40 AM] Lore: Ah sí? Que bienn! Estarán enamoradas de su profesor rulitos jajaj
[6/14/20, 9:13:53 AM] Joe: They’re just mellower and easier to deal with haha. If there is a little one that is super well behaved they’ll end up being my favorite haha.
[6/14/20, 9:14:25 AM] Joe: Oh god I hope not hahaha
[6/14/20, 9:14:56 AM] Lore: Jaja papi Joe
[6/14/20, 9:16:05 AM] Lore: Jaja las adolescentes uuuh
[6/14/20, 9:16:30 AM] Lore: Son más "traviesas" algunas jaja
[6/14/20, 9:18:59 AM] Joe: Haha good thing we don’t get too many teenage girls either. 1 or 2 maybe. Lots of younger girls though which is interesting. Parents signing them up for skate camp. They’re usually pretty cool though, more helpful and listen better than the boys haha
[6/14/20, 9:21:18 AM] Lore: Jajaja
‎[6/14/20, 9:21:40 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/14/20, 9:23:27 AM] Lore: Esta bueno que las niñas más pequeñas tengan la posibilidad de patinar también, al final siempre son mayoría los chicos en estas cosas
[6/14/20, 9:26:25 AM] Joe: The demographics are changing slowly in skateboarding. Lots of girls are skating now. It’s cool to see. Skateboarding is supposed to be for everyone so I like to see it expanding.
[6/14/20, 9:28:02 AM] Lore: Claro está bueno eso
[6/14/20, 9:30:10 AM] Lore: Me gusta que pienses así
[6/14/20, 9:30:17 AM] Lore: +1punto jaja

[6/14/20, 11:12:06 AM] Joe: I tried haha. Then I ate a little and didn’t have a coffee. Made me sleepy again
[6/14/20, 2:38:41 PM] Lore: Que tal?
[6/14/20, 2:39:01 PM] Lore: Yo fui a un bar con mis amigas y desconecté del trabajo
[6/14/20, 2:39:32 PM] Joe: haha you probably needed that after listening to those chicks all day
[6/14/20, 2:39:56 PM] Joe: I'm good, just messing with some of my old projects. Cleaning up the code a little bit

[6/14/20, 2:43:01 PM] Lore: Jajajaja 🤭
[6/14/20, 2:43:02 PM] Joe: Yeah i was surprised when you starting talking shit about them hahaha not a bad thing though. Can't be super sweet all the time haha
[6/14/20, 2:43:56 PM] Lore: Normalmente duerme con Luchi por la noche y cuando ella se va abre mi habitación y se mete en mi cama.. pero esta semana trabajo por la mañana y tendré que irme pronto 😭
[6/14/20, 2:44:22 PM] Lore: Ups Kaká
[6/14/20, 2:44:24 PM] Lore: Jaja
[6/14/20, 2:45:07 PM] Lore: Soy dulce con la gente que me cae bien, con gente superficial la verdad que no lo soy
[6/14/20, 2:45:32 PM] Lore: 🤷🤷🤷
[6/14/20, 2:46:38 PM] Joe: Haha i can tell. You're very sweet with meeee 😂 But that's totally understandable. I really dislike superficiality
[6/14/20, 2:49:47 PM] Lore: Jajaj si, vos no te podés quejar. Te tengo "mimado"
[6/14/20, 2:53:39 PM] Joe: Being sweet is all part of your scheme to get me to Spain haha
[6/14/20, 2:54:19 PM] Joe: I'm interested to see/hear you get mad or annoyed at me a little bit haha I reaaaaallly want to know what you get like when you're upset with me. I
[6/14/20, 2:54:32 PM] Joe: I'm sure i'll push your buttons enough to find out eventually haha
[6/14/20, 2:55:40 PM] Lore: Jajaja 🤭🤭🤭
[6/14/20, 2:58:05 PM] Lore: Sabés que tengo carácter, puedo ser dulce cuando estoy bien pero cuando estoy mal o algo me molesta, me puedo enojar mucho jaja
[6/14/20, 3:00:49 PM] Joe: haha i'm nervous 😂
[6/14/20, 3:00:51 PM] Lore: puedo enojarme.. a lo mejor hay veces que por cosas tontas o algunas que me molesten de verdad como a todo el mundo, pero no soy nada rencorosa, me considero comprensiva y hago las paces rápido jaja
[6/14/20, 3:01:43 PM] Joe: Alright haha for sure. I'm sure i can handle it regardless. I just want to be prepared haha
[6/14/20, 3:01:58 PM] Lore: Bueno ya lo sabes, estás a tiempo de no venir a verme jaja no soy dulce las 24hs
[6/14/20, 3:02:31 PM] Lore: 😬😂
[6/14/20, 3:03:25 PM] Joe: Haha i don't expect you to be sweet all the time. I just want to know how to work with the type of person you are. If you're the type that needs space or needs to talk about it right away, it's good to know these things
[6/14/20, 3:04:36 PM] Joe: It sucks when someone doesn't understand how you deal with being angry. Usually that leads to even more anger and bigger fights haha.
[6/14/20, 3:05:10 PM] Lore: Jaja Joe psicólogo
[6/14/20, 3:05:37 PM] Lore: Mmm, en realidad cuando estoy enojada y me dejan espacio puede que sea peor
[6/14/20, 3:06:03 PM] Joe: i just like to know what works and what doesn't haha.
[6/14/20, 3:06:26 PM] Joe: hahah ok so don't give too much room when you're mad...got it
[6/14/20, 3:06:53 PM] Lore: Jajaj es raro tener que explicarlo
[6/14/20, 3:08:07 PM] Lore: Pero depende.. normalmente si algo me molesta y no estás encima mío, puede que deje de darte importancia, por que siento que me estás dando mucho espacio =poco interés
[6/14/20, 3:09:43 PM] Lore: Jaja no sé, depende la situación. Yo siempre creo que la comunicacion es clave. Puedo ponerme en tu lugar y vos en el mío si en algún momento no estamos de acuerdo.
[6/14/20, 3:10:13 PM] Joe: Ok ok i get that. Makes sense.
[6/14/20, 3:11:20 PM] Joe: Well....i want you to know that if you feel i'm not giving you enough of anything, attention or space, let me know. I agree that communication is key so be as open as you can and i'll try my best to do the same
[6/14/20, 3:12:01 PM] Lore: Jaja hacé lo que vos sientas
[6/14/20, 3:12:28 PM] Lore: No lo que yo pueda querer
[6/14/20, 3:13:00 PM] Lore: Valoro que tengas interés por complacerme
[6/14/20, 3:14:15 PM] Lore: De hecho siempre haces que me sienta cómoda, siempre me escribís o estás pendiente, aunque estés lejos
[6/14/20, 3:17:30 PM] Joe: Noooo problem. I just want to know more about you haha. I'm super interested in what you're like day to day now since we've been talking for so long.
[6/14/20, 3:21:32 PM] Lore: Yo también quiero saber más de vos

[6/14/20, 3:28:29 PM] Lore: Las manos si
[6/14/20, 3:29:22 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s all in the hands. I need to find more haha
[6/14/20, 3:30:42 PM] Lore: Jjjj sii busca

[6/14/20, 3:34:36 PM] Joe: Aah what you got to ride horses? Siiiick
[6/14/20, 3:37:58 PM] Joe: Damn you have so many haha i can't find more. When i do i'll send them though. You win this round haha
[6/14/20, 3:39:17 PM] Lore: No, era una granja a la que íbamos de pequeños y me encantaba, con animales y recogiendo choclos
[6/14/20, 3:40:16 PM] Lore: No tengo más, solo algunas encontré en casa de mis padres
[6/14/20, 3:43:00 PM] Lore: Joe, al final no me respondiste. Como sos vos, jaja sí te enfadas conmigo en algún momento o " I'll push your buttons", que tendría que hacer? Jjj
[6/14/20, 3:45:13 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha. It's situational for me. If i'm only a little mad or annoyed, i'd like to talk about it. But if i get really upset, to the point i want to yell, i would rather just have space and not fight. Take time to breathe then come back and talk about it.
[6/14/20, 3:45:56 PM] Joe: It's really hard to upset me to the point of yelling. That's rare. But when it does happen space for a short time, with the understanding we'll try to talk about it later, is best for me.
[6/14/20, 3:47:49 PM] Joe: But most of the time I just try to bring up what i'm feeling if there are any problems before it gets to be too big of a deal and since you seem like you're willing to talk to me about things we should be good
[6/14/20, 3:49:57 PM] Lore: Jaja uuh no te imagino gritando
[6/14/20, 3:51:02 PM] Lore: Pero si llego a tocarte los "botones" jajaja tomaré espacio
‎[6/14/20, 3:53:15 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/14/20, 3:53:20 PM] Joe: haha it's super rare. Not much upsets me to that point.
[6/14/20, 3:55:04 PM] Joe: Now i know what you mean about it being hard to describe haha
[6/14/20, 3:55:48 PM] Joe: But I don't want you to think i get super mad often cause i don't. I try to not let things bug me.
[6/14/20, 3:56:38 PM] Lore: Jaja está bien no pasa nada
[6/14/20, 3:58:03 PM] Joe: What time do you have to get up tomorrow?
[6/14/20, 3:58:14 PM] Lore: Solo quería saberlo también, no sé si algún día discutiremos a este punto jajaj, pero creo que el vínculo que creamos es a base de diálogo y buena comunicación
[6/14/20, 3:58:43 PM] Lore: No empieces Joe!
[6/14/20, 3:58:44 PM] Lore: Jaja

[6/14/20, 4:00:40 PM] Joe: Hahahah nooo i was just asking
[6/14/20, 4:01:00 PM] Joe: If you have more questions, ask away haha
[6/14/20, 4:01:25 PM] Lore: No ya no tengo jaja
[6/14/20, 4:01:33 PM] Lore: Me iré a dormir
[6/14/20, 4:02:04 PM] Joe: Noooooooooooo
[6/14/20, 4:02:05 PM] Joe: hahah
[6/14/20, 4:02:18 PM] Lore: Al final no coincidermos para hablar 🤷
[6/14/20, 4:02:40 PM] Joe: hahaha
[6/14/20, 4:03:01 PM] Joe: i only asked what time you have to wake up 😂

[6/15/20, 3:29:28 PM] Lore: Espero que no sea demasiado "cursi" puede que alguna parte.. pero el actor es bueno!
[6/15/20, 3:30:27 PM] Joe: Haha it's pretty good. I'm at the part where she meets that southern rich dude
[6/15/20, 3:31:03 PM] Lore: Ahhh siii jjj

[6/15/20, 3:32:04 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/15/20, 3:32:20 PM] Lore: Noah es mil veces mejor que el rico
[6/15/20, 3:32:22 PM] Joe: Now this dude is trying to get her to marry him 😱
[6/15/20, 3:32:31 PM] Lore: Aunque el rico es muy lindo y bueno

[6/15/20, 3:35:59 PM] Lore: Ayude jjj
[6/15/20, 3:37:46 PM] Joe: And the rollercoaster continues hahaha what the hell
[6/15/20, 3:37:53 PM] Joe: good thing happens bad thing happens
[6/15/20, 3:38:07 PM] Joe: feel good then they instantly make you feel bad hahaha. Shit
[6/15/20, 3:38:51 PM] Joe: Alright alright i'm going to stop giving you the play by play. You know how this movie goes haha.
[6/15/20, 3:40:48 PM] Lore: Jajajaja Joe viendo nootebook
[6/15/20, 3:40:57 PM] Lore: Me encanta jajaj
[6/15/20, 3:41:53 PM] Lore: A mí me gusta, me gusta tu opinión, aunque podés juzgarla en cualquier momento jajaja
[6/15/20, 3:42:08 PM] Lore: Al menos conseguí que la estés viendo
[6/15/20, 3:46:32 PM] Joe: All romance type movies are a little corny so i can't judge too harshly. I'm enjoying it so far though
[6/15/20, 3:47:44 PM] Lore: Biennn!!
[6/15/20, 3:48:16 PM] Lore: Escribime con lo que sea, quiero saber que te gusta y que no jajaj

[6/15/20, 3:51:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/15/20, 3:51:06 PM] Lore: En el coche?
[6/15/20, 3:52:11 PM] Joe: Yeah haha ran over his nice fence
[6/15/20, 3:53:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja la cara de el me gusta, como ehh jaja 🤨
[6/15/20, 3:53:38 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[6/15/20, 3:59:32 PM] Joe: Aw she doesn’t remember anyone. That sucks
[6/15/20, 4:00:04 PM] Lore: 😔
[6/15/20, 4:00:14 PM] Joe: Ok sorry hahah I can’t help but message you about everything happening even though you know it all already
[6/15/20, 4:00:35 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/15/20, 4:01:02 PM] Lore: Me gusta que la estés viendo así que enviame lo que quieras
[6/15/20, 4:01:25 PM] Lore: Se que es lo que pasa en todos los momentos jaja
[6/15/20, 4:02:27 PM] Joe: Hahah this must be one of your top 5 favorite movies
[6/15/20, 4:02:52 PM] Lore: Jaja es que películas no suelen gustarme muchas
[6/15/20, 4:03:04 PM] Lore: Pero las que me gustan, las recuerdo bien
[6/15/20, 4:04:25 PM] Lore: Los odiosos ocho (The hateful eight) me gustó mucho también y no tiene nada que ver a esta, es súper sangrienta jaja 🙄
[6/15/20, 4:08:31 PM] Joe: Hahah good to know. You had to tell me to make sure I don’t think you only like “corny” movies 😂 

They just got off the boat in the rain. Some funny stuff in there but the drama continues haha


Not too corny but some of the lines made me laugh.
[6/15/20, 4:11:16 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, no quiero que pienses que soy una cursi de pelis tontas de amor. No, no, no. Jaja esta es diferente 🤫
[6/15/20, 4:13:16 PM] Lore: Ohhh si, la lluvia jaja mierda no quiero hacerte spoiler
[6/15/20, 4:14:38 PM] Joe: Haha yeah no spoilers. I’m at the part where Allie is asking her mom about the letters
[6/15/20, 4:15:12 PM] Lore: Ah ella no duerme ahí no?
[6/15/20, 4:15:19 PM] Lore: Se va al hotel
[6/15/20, 4:15:44 PM] Lore: Y luego la zorra de su madre le cuenta que se las escondió

[6/15/20, 4:25:56 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/15/20, 4:51:16 PM] Joe: Well that was a pretty sad movie
[6/15/20, 4:52:52 PM] Joe: When she remembered and then after they dance she gets all mad. Hella sad dammit haha it was good though. Noa was a coooool dude
[6/15/20, 4:53:46 PM] Lore: Esa parte es con la que lloro normalmente
[6/15/20, 4:55:03 PM] Lore: Jaja,  me parece tan real y tan triste verlo de mayor

[6/15/20, 4:57:09 PM] Lore: Jajaj
[6/15/20, 4:57:09 PM] Joe: People definitely get easily upset when they're like that
[6/15/20, 4:57:22 PM] Joe: hahaha
[6/15/20, 4:58:13 PM] Joe: Oh the one cool thing about forgetting everything was, we tricked her into thinking she quit smoking hahaha
[6/15/20, 4:58:15 PM] Lore: 😮😟 que duro
[6/15/20, 4:59:02 PM] Joe: One day she was going to go buy her pack of smokes and my aunt just told her, "you don't smoke anymore, remember?". Grandma said, "oh i don't? Ok" and never smoked again.
[6/15/20, 4:59:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja buenísimo
[6/15/20, 5:00:00 PM] Lore: 😲👏👏👏
[6/15/20, 5:01:02 PM] Joe: When that happened she was in her 80s i think, and she had been smoking since a teenager haha. She passed away like 10 years ago but it's just an interesting example of how powerful those mental problems can be.
[6/15/20, 5:01:50 PM] Joe: But yeah, in the movie, super said that moment when she remembers haha
[6/15/20, 5:01:53 PM] Lore: Super interesante!!
[6/15/20, 5:02:02 PM] Joe: sad* not said
[6/15/20, 5:02:43 PM] Joe: That was a rollercoaster of drama haha
[6/15/20, 5:03:05 PM] Lore: Si, cuando ella recuerda y cuando noa la ve sufrir mientras le dan calmantes

[6/15/20, 7:03:15 PM] Joe: Haha I just thought it was a good story. Beautiful. Both happy and sad. Like real life. It’s complicated.

[6/16/20, 12:33:34 PM] Joe: Hahah thats my coworker for today
[6/16/20, 12:35:27 PM] Joe: So normally I work a very short day. 8:30am until 12:30. But sometimes I’ll pick up extra hours monitoring the park or giving private lessons. On those days I’m not sure what time I’ll get off. Depends on the day
[6/16/20, 12:36:24 PM] Lore: Ahhhh hoy estás haciendo como extra de monitor
[6/16/20, 12:36:31 PM] Lore: Vigilando
[6/16/20, 12:36:45 PM] Lore: Y que haces jaja les gritas desde ahí con tu café? 😅
[6/16/20, 12:37:00 PM] Lore: Quiero ver una de esas correcciones
[6/16/20, 12:39:12 PM] Joe: Hahaha we have a limit on how many people can enter so I’m sitting by the entrance keeping track and letting people in
[6/16/20, 12:40:28 PM] Lore: Ahhh, pero el skatepark es público, ahora puede ir cualquiera. O solo tus alumnos?
[6/16/20, 12:41:49 PM] Joe: It’s open to the public now. Camp ended at noon(40 minutes ago)
[6/16/20, 12:42:53 PM] Joe: It’s cool though. I just hang out here and skate once in while to pass the time. Should go by quick. I like getting paid to be at the skatepark anyway. Best job 😂
[6/16/20, 12:45:39 PM] Lore: Ahh ahora sí entendí okey
[6/16/20, 12:46:26 PM] Lore: Jaja sí el trabajo pinta bien, trabajo "eterna juventud"
[6/16/20, 12:49:55 PM] Joe: Hahah someone said I looked hella young for 30 yesterday. They didn’t believe my age when I told them. It was pretty funny.
[6/16/20, 12:51:21 PM] Lore: 🤭🤭

[6/16/20, 2:29:41 PM] Lore: Cómo lo llevas?
[6/16/20, 2:33:47 PM] Joe: I’m bored haha. I skated for a while and now my legs are getting sore.
[6/16/20, 2:34:09 PM] Joe: Only 2 1/2 hours to go though. Not bad
[6/16/20, 2:44:29 PM] Lore: Jjj tus piernas desde que llegaste a California

[6/16/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha true! I’ve been skating too much since I got back and not enough when I was in Hawaii. Have to build the strength back up.
[6/16/20, 2:49:18 PM] Joe: How are youuu? What’re you doing?
[6/16/20, 3:03:11 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno en Hawaii estabas más relax, solo paseíto mañanero a la playa
[6/16/20, 3:03:37 PM] Lore: Yo bien, estaba cenando con las chicas y ya ahora en la habitaciones
[6/16/20, 3:04:11 PM] Lore: *Habitación
[6/16/20, 3:07:48 PM] Joe: Yeah it was great haha
[6/17/20, 1:07:17 AM] Joe: Buenos días. I want our old schedules back. I’m getting ready to go to bed soon but I wanted to say hello first haha
[6/17/20, 1:19:02 AM] Joe: Oh last thing before I fall asleep...I don’t think I sent you this before. What this dude built is really cool to me. It has subtitles you can turn on. 


Ok, miss you, talk to you later. Have a good day

[6/17/20, 1:36:16 AM] Joe: Oh for sure I agee. I really want to work something out to make sure we keep talking.
[6/17/20, 1:36:40 AM] Joe: And I don’t want you to feel like I’m not giving you attention or something like that.
[6/17/20, 1:37:37 AM] Joe: That’s why I wanted to say something to you before I went to bed. I really want to talk to you all the time but it’s just been difficult lately.
[6/17/20, 1:38:58 AM] Lore: Que bien, que puedas decirme esto y sientas lo mismo!
[6/17/20, 1:40:39 AM] Lore: Esta bien saberloo! Gracias bombón, te dejo dormir! Pensemos algo para poder sacar tiempo los dos. Un abrazo!! Que duermas súper bien!

[6/17/20, 11:38:54 AM] Joe: Damn I thought I was tan when I was in Hawaii but I’m getting hella darker being at the skatepark haha. Another chaotic day of camp almost over 😀
[6/17/20, 12:00:33 PM] Lore: Jajaj chico del asfalto poniéndose moreno
[6/17/20, 12:01:02 PM] Lore: A ver si me mostras ese tono moreno jajaj
[6/17/20, 12:01:31 PM] Lore: Hoy también haces vigilancia del skatepark? Q tal con los nenes?
[6/17/20, 12:15:01 PM] Joe: No monitoring for me today. I’m heading home now. My board hit me in my arm and face hahaha now my arm hurts and i have a little bump on my chin 😂
[6/17/20, 1:08:46 PM] Lore: Nooo
[6/17/20, 1:08:54 PM] Lore: Pobrecito!!!
[6/17/20, 1:14:58 PM] Lore: Yo me vine a la sierra por el cumple de mi hermano, fuimos a cenar y estoy llenisima! Ya me voy para Madrid

[6/17/20, 1:19:09 PM] Joe: Get back home safe. Happy birthday to your brother 🥳 🎊
[6/17/20, 1:19:36 PM] Joe: 😂
[6/17/20, 1:19:46 PM] Joe: You need to wear some stretchy pants next time
[6/17/20, 1:20:18 PM] Lore: Gracias!
[6/17/20, 1:21:19 PM] Lore: Mi madre le hizo un vídeo recopilando algunas fotos y yo le agregué música y alguna más.. el parecía fuerte al principio y terminó soltando unas lágrimas jajaja
[6/17/20, 1:21:30 PM] Lore: Mi madre y yo también claro jaja
[6/17/20, 1:23:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got him to shed a tear. Didn’t even have to make him watch The Notebook first haha.
[6/17/20, 1:24:00 PM] Joe: That’s sweet though. Videos like that are great, looking back at all the memories and stuff
‎[6/17/20, 1:25:20 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/17/20, 1:26:10 PM] Lore: Jaja sí el no es de llorar , pero mi madre encontró unas cuantas fotos de cuando era pequeño y empezó a correr y eso le tocó la fibra jjj
‎[6/17/20, 1:26:34 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/17/20, 1:27:11 PM] Lore: Yo pedí unos ravioles rellenos de pera con crema de gorgonzola. Me gusta probar sabores diferentes
[6/17/20, 1:32:35 PM] Joe: hahah what was with the music? Looks like a good time
[6/17/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: Sounds good. How did you like it?
[6/17/20, 1:33:54 PM] Lore: Jaja que al principio le pusieron una canción de cumpleaños y al segundo salió una de navidad 🤭😅
[6/17/20, 1:34:49 PM] Joe: Ooooh, yeah i was confused when the Christmas music came on  haha
[6/17/20, 1:36:04 PM] Lore: Mm me gusta lo clásico de siempre, pero si voy a comer a algún restaurante me gusta pedir cosas con especias, como curry o combinaciones con frutas tropicales en salsas o algo de eso. Depende
‎[6/17/20, 1:38:10 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/17/20, 1:38:37 PM] Joe: That makes sense. Have the fancier stuff when you go out. You can make the classic stuff at home haha
[6/17/20, 1:39:39 PM] Joe: Hella cute
[6/17/20, 1:39:59 PM] Lore: Si, a vos que tipo de comida te gusta? O que no te gusta?
[6/17/20, 1:40:47 PM] Joe: Hmmm I'm not a huge fan of sushi but i still eat it haha
[6/17/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I don't know what i like. Just good tasting food haha. Most things grilled on a barbecue is delicious to me. Lots of meat dishes.
[6/17/20, 1:43:03 PM] Joe: My favorite dish is probably lomo saltado
[6/17/20, 1:43:17 PM] Joe: hella good mmmmm i want some now
[6/17/20, 1:44:46 PM] Lore: Jaja entonces vos de vegetariano difícil jaja
[6/17/20, 1:44:58 PM] Lore: Perú no?
[6/17/20, 1:45:33 PM] Joe: Oh i love to eat a good bowl of pho. We have some really good Vietnamese food places around here. Ah there is too much stuff i like. Some i don't like but i'll give most things a try
[6/17/20, 1:45:33 PM] Lore: Jajaj
[6/17/20, 1:45:49 PM] Joe: Yes it's a Peruvian dish
[6/17/20, 1:46:45 PM] Lore: Ah eso es típico ahí o por gente de tu alrededor? Acá no se ve demasiado vietnamita..nunca probé eso
[6/17/20, 1:49:54 PM] Joe: The bay area is a really good place for trying different kinds of food. You can find food from any culture relatively easy around here with a short drive. There are quite a few Vietnamese places around me. It's super good. Especially if you want some hot soup
[6/17/20, 1:49:56 PM] Joe: mmmm
[6/17/20, 1:52:12 PM] Joe: Oh and food from a good taco truck is always smackin haha
[6/17/20, 1:52:59 PM] Joe: I can't believe you've never had Pho
[6/17/20, 1:55:58 PM] Lore: Jaja sí como acá, hay mucho kebab, italiano, mexicano, indios en general
[6/17/20, 1:56:41 PM] Lore: Hella smackinn jaja tacos 🤤
[6/17/20, 1:57:50 PM] Lore: Jaja no, pero se me ocurre que cuando lo pruebe será con vos, te parece? Jaja
[6/17/20, 2:01:31 PM] Joe: Damn I sure hope so!

[6/17/20, 2:04:12 PM] Lore: Me encantaria conocer Vietnam.. Filipinas...
[6/17/20, 2:05:25 PM] Lore: Viajar es lo mejor
[6/17/20, 2:06:03 PM] Lore: Es como que valoras más la vida
[6/17/20, 2:09:11 PM] Joe: Yeah that's true. It can definitely change your perspective on life
[6/17/20, 2:12:31 PM] Joe: I have friends that have gone on trips to the Philippines and Vietnam and they enjoyed the time there. I need to go
[6/17/20, 2:14:21 PM] Lore: Si fuese "libre" ahora te diría de encontrarnos en algún país de Asia jaja aprendería un poco de inglés por las dudas jajajja
[6/17/20, 2:17:44 PM] Joe: Hahah that would be siiiiick. If only we were free now. We'll get there eventually haha
‎[6/17/20, 2:18:55 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[6/17/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: Haha I only call her on the weekends officially now. Sometimes I call during the week but I get busy so I don’t want her waiting for me when my schedule changes.
[6/17/20, 2:21:25 PM] Joe: I’m still learning haha I’m sure you’ll get a little English figured out too so we’ll be fiiine 😂
[6/17/20, 2:43:01 PM] Lore: Jaja pero hablan en español o ya no?
[6/17/20, 2:43:06 PM] Lore: Malditos horarios
‎[6/17/20, 2:43:41 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/17/20, 2:45:06 PM] Lore: Jajaj si, creo que voy a empezar clases por Skype con una academia, ya estuve averiguando la semana pasada pero no es seguro jaja tengo que ver mis horarios 🙊
[6/17/20, 2:45:32 PM] Joe: I’m still so terrible at stringing together a sentence so a lot of it is me listening to her speak Spanish to me. But I try to speak Spanish when I can figure out a sentence or two
[6/17/20, 2:47:00 PM] Lore: Podés practicar conmigo, ya lo sabes!!! Hoy bien hablando comparandote con el aguacate 😂
[6/17/20, 2:47:21 PM] Joe: When you send me audio clips too. I just listen over and over and try to hear what you’re saying really well. I don’t know. I’m trying though. I still have my notebook which I forgot at work today because I was trying to look at it when I had time haha
[6/17/20, 2:48:38 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I did get my one sentence in this morning haha. It’s difficult to remind myself to practice but I try
[6/17/20, 2:48:43 PM] Lore: Jajaj ohh. Imagínate que alguien encuentra ese cuaderno con todas las notas en español 🤭🤣
[6/17/20, 2:49:35 PM] Joe: They’d be so confused. My notes are all over the place. I also have my sketches for websites and notes for programming.
[6/17/20, 2:49:49 PM] Joe: A bunch of nonsense in that notebook to whoever finds it haha
[6/17/20, 2:49:49 PM] Lore: Si me hizo gracia, no me lo esperaba jajaja
[6/17/20, 2:51:11 PM] Joe: My spanish will be limited to one liners that resemble the structure of a meme 😂
[6/17/20, 2:52:08 PM] Joe: Hahah nah I’ll get better though. My vocabulary is just super limited still. I haven’t been studying vocabulary enough
‎[6/17/20, 2:52:33 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/17/20, 2:52:47 PM] Lore: Gif/ vídeos/ fotos
[6/17/20, 2:53:22 PM] Lore: Tenés que apuntarte las cosas que yo digo
[6/17/20, 2:54:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha wow that’s a lot of stuff we sent to each other 😂
[6/17/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s hard. You always say things in different ways
[6/17/20, 2:58:57 PM] Lore: Jajaj mmmm
[6/17/20, 2:58:58 PM] Joe: The only thing you say often is that you’re sorry you fell asleep haha other than that you vary your sentences quite a bit so you might say something similar but it isn’t the same phrase
[6/17/20, 3:00:16 PM] Joe: Unlike me hahah I’ll say the same exact thing over and over 😂
[6/17/20, 3:00:17 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/17/20, 3:00:24 PM] Lore: Si eso no hay muchas maneras de decirlo
[6/17/20, 3:00:40 PM] Lore: Mierda, me quedé dormida
[6/17/20, 3:01:24 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s the one. You’re most used phrase by far haha
[6/17/20, 3:01:37 PM] Joe: Your*
[6/17/20, 3:01:59 PM] Lore: No, vos decís un montón de cosas que yo no entiendo y directamente uso traductor jaja es muy rápido
[6/17/20, 3:02:40 PM] Lore: La tuya es es "me quedé dormido en el sofá"
[6/17/20, 3:03:14 PM] Lore: O.. me levanté demasiado pronto jaja aunque eso ya no te pasa, solo en Hawaii
[6/17/20, 3:03:19 PM] Joe: Haha siii
[6/17/20, 3:04:10 PM] Joe: Yeah now I got up too late. My body is still in Hawaii time. 8am feels like 5am to me.
[6/17/20, 3:06:03 PM] Lore: Jaja eso te viene mejor
[6/17/20, 3:07:32 PM] Joe: It does haha
[6/17/20, 3:08:11 PM] Joe: Wait I missed this thing. So what class are you going to take?
‎[6/17/20, 3:10:32 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[6/17/20, 3:12:50 PM] Lore: Mmm no sé si me entenderas, te lo escribo
[6/17/20, 3:15:32 PM] Lore: "Estuve averiguando en algunas academias pero me aburre tremendamente tener que ir a clase, entonces estaba pensando alguna opción online, Skype o algo de eso y hay una academia que está bien porque son clases de conversación y son diferentes profesores con diferentes acentos.. y nada.. son dos horas por semana y creo que en la clase somos como de 3 a 8 alumnos nada más.. Así que no sé, puede estar bie, puedo probarlo"
[6/17/20, 3:15:46 PM] Lore: Te lo escribí tal cual, así podés escuchar mientras lees
[6/17/20, 3:16:24 PM] Lore: Puede estar( *bien)
[6/17/20, 3:17:08 PM] Joe: Thanks. I appreciate that. That was a lot to type out haha
[6/17/20, 3:18:53 PM] Joe: Eh actually I wasn’t far off from listening to you. There is sooo much I didn’t hear correctly or comprehend but got enough that I was “in the ballpark”
[6/17/20, 3:20:23 PM] Lore: Ah siiii???? Uhh jaja muy bien!
[6/17/20, 3:21:07 PM] Joe: When you say things like “que ir a clase” the words all blend together haha. Like “tener quira clase”
[6/17/20, 3:22:40 PM] Lore: Jajajaja qué gracia
[6/17/20, 3:22:45 PM] Lore: A ver voy a escucharlo
[6/17/20, 3:22:46 PM] Joe: I wasn’t very confident though haha and like I said I missed a lot of it. when I translated i realized I had the basic idea of what you were saying but I missed the specifics
[6/17/20, 3:23:26 PM] Lore: Es verdad jaja es que lo digo muy rápido
[6/17/20, 3:24:28 PM] Joe: Yeah whenever you start to speed up you lose me a little but it’s ok. It’s good to hear what someone really sounds like when they say these things. The same blending of words happens often when people speak English too
[6/17/20, 3:24:33 PM] Lore: Digo mucho como "coletilla" y nada.. jaja eso siempre lo digo.. nadaa.. blabla
[6/17/20, 3:25:27 PM] Lore: Me alegra que puedas entender la idea, aprovecharé para enseñarte esos detalles, así no te quejas de que soy mala profesora jajaj
[6/17/20, 3:25:52 PM] Joe: Haha sometimes you say “nada” and my brain totally gets stuck on how it is connected to what you are saying 😂
[6/17/20, 3:26:43 PM] Joe: Like I think you said “nada” at the beginning of an audio clip one time and it confused the crap out of me because it changed the context of what you were saying when I translated it in my head haha
[6/17/20, 3:26:49 PM] Lore: Jajaja ya... 🙊 Además lo digo demasiado pero no siempre en los mismos momentos
[6/17/20, 3:27:54 PM] Lore: Igual en inglés muchas de tus palabras, en inglés británico las entiendo pero en inglés americano es como 🥴🥴🥴 que? Jajaj
[6/17/20, 3:29:47 PM] Joe: Haha that’s strange. I guess I need to speak “proper English” so you can understand me 😂
[6/17/20, 3:30:20 PM] Lore: Cuando enseñe algún video a mis amigas, ellas estaban como ... 😯 Esta diciendo esto? Jaja y sonaba tan diferente a como nos lo enseñaron en el colegio
[6/17/20, 3:30:28 PM] Lore: Fue gracioso jaja
[6/17/20, 3:33:52 PM] Joe: Haha damn I still haven’t shown a video of you to my friends. I want to now. I need to get there reactions.
[6/17/20, 3:36:12 PM] Joe: But they’ve probably all lurked on your Instagram already I bet cause everyone is so nosy haha
[6/17/20, 3:36:44 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[6/17/20, 3:37:17 PM] Lore: El día que publicamos las casitas tu hermano volvió a caer 😂😂

[6/17/20, 3:47:15 PM] Lore: Que bueno se casan, pero es súper joven tu hermano, no?
[6/17/20, 3:50:45 PM] Joe: He is 2 years younger than me
[6/17/20, 3:54:48 PM] Joe: Haha that’s true. It would be a good time. Got to get you to the US though. It’s in Eugene, Oregon

[6/22/20, 1:29:49 PM] Lore: Bueno genial que tengas la cita mañana!!!! 👏👏 Ya tenés fotito? Jaja
[6/22/20, 1:31:20 PM] Joe: Haha damn I wish it was that fast here. I don’t have a photo but I can pay $15 to get one taken at my appointment. I need to fill out some paperwork and make a photocopy of some paperwork though
‎[6/22/20, 1:32:13 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted

[6/22/20, 1:49:26 PM] Lore: Jaja 15 dólares una foto?
[6/22/20, 1:49:45 PM] Lore: Cuánto sale sacarte el pasaporte?
[6/22/20, 1:51:01 PM] Joe: Haha the passport services are $35 and yes, unfortunately the photo really is $15 ahaha
[6/22/20, 1:52:28 PM] Joe: They'll probably charge some other fees too. Who knows. So far it's $50 total. We'll find out tomorrow if i have to spend more than that for the actual passport itself. Cause the receipt said i paid for "passport services" which makes me think i only paid for the appointment
[6/22/20, 1:52:55 PM] Lore: Ahhh es que estoy viendo que en España son 30 eur
[6/22/20, 1:53:05 PM] Lore: Pero el mío en el consulado uruguayo son 100eu jaja
[6/22/20, 1:53:29 PM] Lore: Igual 50 dol. por todo está bien
[6/22/20, 1:54:28 PM] Joe: Hopefully it's only 50 total. I'm looking online and supposedly i have to pay more for the booklet or whatever
[6/22/20, 1:54:39 PM] Joe: We'll see
[6/22/20, 1:54:54 PM] Joe: At least i got that money from Andrew Yang to pay for it hahaha

[6/22/20, 2:23:47 PM] Joe: I have a lot to figure out though too. How long do I go for? Will I stay with you? What if you end up hating me? Do I go back to the US after?
[6/22/20, 2:24:30 PM] Joe: There is a lot of complications with international travel
[6/22/20, 2:24:38 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja

[6/22/20, 2:31:45 PM] Lore: Sisi this shit hella smackinnnn dulce de lechee
[6/22/20, 2:32:11 PM] Joe: I’m trying to be fluent in Spanish regardless of what happens so I’m going to keep learning. I’m still watching shows in spanish and listening to spanish music. There is a lot to learn
[6/22/20, 2:33:00 PM] Lore: Me alegro! Pensé que ya no lo hacías jaja solo en Hawaii
[6/22/20, 2:33:19 PM] Lore: Jaja todas esas preguntas no las sé, yo también las pienso
[6/22/20, 2:34:19 PM] Lore: Excepto odiarte, eso será imposible! Pero espero que vos a mí tampoco!

[6/22/20, 2:42:48 PM] Joe: Now I don’t know how to greet you. You’re making me nervous hahaha I’m not supposed to think about these things. I just go with the flow or whatever haha
[6/22/20, 2:42:52 PM] Joe: Shit
[6/22/20, 2:43:21 PM] Lore: Si claro esto es ir con la corriente jajaja
[6/22/20, 2:44:07 PM] Lore: Te saludaré cordial para que no me hagas como Bean... Además no te gusta que te toquen jaja

[6/22/20, 2:53:51 PM] Lore: Jaja ninguno de los dos es serio jaja divertido
[6/22/20, 2:55:15 PM] Lore: Ay no sé jaja te lo juro es rarísimo para mí, intento pensar cosas.. pero imagínate que no quiero que te vayass! 🙊 eso sería terrible
[6/22/20, 2:57:28 PM] Joe: Haha yeah but I think I’m only allowed to go for 90 days unless I apply for something specific. Or even if I want to work there or whatever. It’s all different stuff I have to do. I don’t know it’s complicated.
[6/22/20, 2:58:59 PM] Joe: But what I do depends a lot on what you want. When I buy my ticket I’ll need to know what I should be planning for I guess. Haha I don’t know it’s hard to explain. I don’t need all the details but a general idea of what you want would be nice.
[6/22/20, 2:59:14 PM] Joe: I don’t want to come barging into your life in a way you didn’t want
[6/22/20, 2:59:46 PM] Lore: Jajaja

[6/22/20, 3:02:02 PM] Lore: Quiero que estés bien y sea una experiencia linda para vos
[6/22/20, 3:04:54 PM] Joe: Haha we'll figure it all out later i guess. Got to get my passport first.
[6/22/20, 3:05:47 PM] Joe: I doubt i'll get bored with you though, especially after only 3 months. It will be hard to leave you i'm sure 🥺
[6/22/20, 3:39:11 PM] Lore: Ey había llegado Sandri y Luchi

[6/23/20, 8:42:43 AM] Lore: Bombón!!!

[6/23/20, 12:34:35 PM] Joe: I was trying to grind a ledge but I missed it with my skateboard and hit my leg on the ledge pretty hard. It’s not too bad. Just really sore
[6/23/20, 12:35:21 PM] Joe: It’s in about an hour at 1:30

[6/23/20, 12:52:28 PM] Lore: Y si falta algo, sonreí jajaja
[6/23/20, 12:53:32 PM] Lore: Acá muchas veces ponen problema por la foto, la gente lleva cualquier cosa jaja así que entiendo que ahí sea obligatoria se aseguran que nadie se hace una foto con fondo malo o cosas en la cabeza
[6/23/20, 12:57:24 PM] Joe: I’m nervous that I’m going to not have something I need haha. It’s ok. If I’m missing something I’ll make another appointment for tomorrow 😂

[6/23/20, 3:40:38 PM] Joe: Like in bed? No I haven’t
[6/23/20, 3:41:00 PM] Joe: I hope I understood that question right cause that was hella random haha
[6/23/20, 3:41:22 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/23/20, 3:41:51 PM] Lore: 😅🙊 soy un poco random
[6/23/20, 3:42:05 PM] Lore: Me refería a si te gustan los chicos también o solo chicas
[6/23/20, 3:43:40 PM] Joe: Oh haha just girls
[6/23/20, 3:45:19 PM] Joe: What about youuu? Do you also like girls or just boys?
[6/23/20, 3:45:38 PM] Lore: Solo chicos!
[6/23/20, 3:46:02 PM] Joe: Haha ok. Interesting questions 😂 😂
[6/23/20, 3:46:02 PM] Lore: Y mucho jaja
[6/23/20, 3:46:10 PM] Joe: Hahahah
[6/23/20, 3:46:44 PM] Lore: Jaja si, me vino a la cabeza jaja antes de que te compres un vuelo o algo de eso jajaja
[6/23/20, 3:46:47 PM] Joe: What am I getting into? Hahaha
[6/23/20, 3:47:31 PM] Joe: Hahah we’ll make sure you ask all the questions you need to before it’s too late
[6/23/20, 3:47:45 PM] Joe: Did I answer correctly?? 😆
[6/23/20, 3:48:59 PM] Lore: Respeto la homosexualidad, la igualdad, etc de hecho tengo amigas y amigos y cada uno es libre.. ( no me entiendas mal) pero la verdad... que no me gustaría un chico que le gusten los hombres... Jaja
[6/23/20, 3:49:56 PM] Joe: Haha ok ok that makes sense.
[6/23/20, 3:50:29 PM] Joe: Don’t worry I’m all about girls only 😂

[6/23/20, 3:51:17 PM] Lore: Vale bien! Menos mal jaja
[6/23/20, 3:51:41 PM] Lore: Tendría que superar que me gustes y te gusten los chicos también eso sería tremendo para mí jajaja
[6/23/20, 3:53:53 PM] Lore: Aunque entiendo que el contrario puede ser diferente.. Me refiero si me gustasen las chicas también te gustaría o no?
[6/23/20, 3:55:00 PM] Joe: Haha this makes me wonder if I gave you a reason to think that I would like guys in the first place
[6/23/20, 3:55:41 PM] Joe: It’s not my preferred situation but it wouldn’t be a deal breaker i guess
[6/23/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: As long as you like me at the moment, I don’t see why I should care if you like girls too 🤷‍♂️
[6/23/20, 3:58:06 PM] Lore: Noooo, ninguna! Jaja simplemente me vino a la cabeza y lo pregunté por las dudas
[6/23/20, 3:58:28 PM] Joe: i’m not into like open relationships or whatever either. So if I like you, you’re the one person I like in that way.
[6/23/20, 3:59:25 PM] Lore: Pero no creo que pueda estar con un chico bisexual. Podría dejar de gustarme, aunque esto es lo que pienso, luego no sé si sería tan así.. nunca me pasó jaja
[6/23/20, 4:00:48 PM] Joe: Haha ok I was also going to ask if you’ve been in that situation before or something.
[6/23/20, 4:01:27 PM] Joe: It’s fine though, I’m not bisexual so you won’t have that problem with me
[6/23/20, 4:01:57 PM] Lore: Nada, tranqui...cero! Jaja los hombres son super liiindos, las chicas nada en ese sentido( para mí)
[6/23/20, 4:02:46 PM] Lore: Jajaj mis amigas se reirían si se enteran que estoy preguntando esto jaja tan aleatoria
[6/23/20, 4:03:27 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I’ll tell them about it someday
[6/23/20, 4:04:51 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[6/23/20, 4:05:30 PM] Lore: Bueno dejando este asunto ya resuelto, que sepas que me hace mucha ilusión que hayas tramitado hoy parte del pasaporte

[6/23/20, 4:12:20 PM] Joe: Hahah that gif was lame
[6/23/20, 4:13:00 PM] Joe: But yeah, no problem. I’m just trying to keep you in the loop so you don’t get tired of waiting and start to think I’ll never come
[6/23/20, 4:13:06 PM] Joe: Cause I’m coming haha
[6/23/20, 4:15:47 PM] Lore: Jaja ya me conoces algo!!
[6/23/20, 4:16:31 PM] Lore: Tonto hone 😣
[6/23/20, 4:22:30 PM] Joe: Sometimes I wonder if you think I won’t come
[6/23/20, 4:26:13 PM] Lore: Jaja no, al principio cuando me lo planteabas me costaba creerte
[6/23/20, 4:28:01 PM] Lore: Pero claro no sabía que seguiríamos en contacto tantos días y que me ibas a gustar tanto jaja 🙊🤐
[6/23/20, 4:29:59 PM] Lore: Ahora sé que si, un poco más cerca. Pero si no te pudiese conocer, me jodería bastante jaja pero bueno

[6/23/20, 4:41:33 PM] Joe: Me alegro de que no huyera cuando empecé a hablar de verte jajaja, pero ¿qué más se suponía que debía hacer? no quería hablar para siempre y nunca conocer.
[6/23/20, 4:44:27 PM] Lore: Jaja sí, tenés razón ... Es lo lógico. Pero en mi mente no estaba tomarlo enserio jaja me parecía casi imposible
[6/23/20, 4:51:48 PM] Joe: jaja será difícil, pero no imposible. y espero que también sea divertido. pero puedo entender que no me creas al principio. parece un poco loco

[6/23/20, 11:44:45 PM] Joe: I forgot to tell you that some kid smacked his chin on the ground today at camp 😬 luckily he didn’t knock out any teeth or anything like that. He just had a cut and bump on his chin. I always forget about the injuries that happen at skate camp

[6/24/20, 12:04:39 AM] Joe: Mmmm holaaa! Hahaha
[6/24/20, 12:05:49 AM] Joe: It wasn’t bad enough to need to go to the hospital or anything but hitting your chin on the ground always sucks. His dad came and picked him up early. He definitely took a solid hit
[6/24/20, 12:07:03 AM] Lore: Que dolor golpearte ahí
[6/24/20, 12:07:21 AM] Lore: Cuál esa la zona que más odias golpearte?
[6/24/20, 12:12:19 AM] Joe: Hmm I guess I hate when I sprain my ankle the most haha.
[6/24/20, 12:14:15 AM] Joe: I’ve done it so many times now. It sucks. I also hate getting hit in the shin. That sucks and is super common.
[6/24/20, 12:15:19 AM] Lore: Jaja sí la espinilla da grima golpearte ahí!

[6/24/20, 12:26:48 PM] Lore: Yo libre también, pero en el metro 🚇
[6/24/20, 12:29:56 PM] Lore: Bien papi profe todos sanos!
[6/24/20, 12:35:20 PM] Joe: Our public transportation is so trash haha. It would take me forever to get home if I didn’t drive.
[6/24/20, 12:36:53 PM] Lore: Si? Cuánto tiempo en auto y cuánto en .. metro, bus, tren? Jaja
[6/24/20, 12:38:37 PM] Lore: Acá en Madrid el transporte es bueno, es una locura ir en auto.. en la sierra yo si me movía en coche pq era todo mucho más rápido en 15 minutos estaba en la casa de mis amigas y en bus 1hr.. pero son pueblo de sierra entonces no hay tanta frecuencia y paradas
[6/24/20, 12:39:30 PM] Joe: 30 minutes driving but probably 1 or 2 hours with public transportation. Either a train and bus or two busses
[6/24/20, 12:39:50 PM] Lore: 😱😱😱
[6/24/20, 12:40:09 PM] Lore: Muchoo
[6/24/20, 12:44:55 PM] Lore: Igual me gustaría vivir en un lugar donde pueda moverme en bicicleta, caminando..una motito o coche transporte corto.. ese es uno de mis deseos para elegir un lugar para vivir en un tiempo.. no me gusta el metro .. aunque vaya rápido jaja
[6/24/20, 12:47:54 PM] Joe: Haha yeah same. I was really enjoying life without a car in Hawaii. Everything I needed was close enough I could just skate everywhere
[6/24/20, 12:49:21 PM] Lore: Jaja
[6/24/20, 12:49:39 PM] Lore: Vos con el skate yo con una bici con canasto ☝️
[6/24/20, 12:56:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha sounds like a plan
[6/24/20, 12:56:38 PM] Joe: Is it more typical to use public transportation than to drive your own car around where you live?
[6/24/20, 12:59:49 PM] Lore: Si
[6/24/20, 1:00:44 PM] Lore: En Madrid, en el centro de la ciudad transporte público. En las afueras, pueblitos, depende donde.. pero auto mejor
[6/24/20, 1:02:01 PM] Lore: Yo tuve solo un auto.. se me rompió hace unos meses.. era viejo y me encantaba, se lo compré a un señor que había sido su único coche y lo cuidaba como si fuese el "Gran Torino", el tenía un diario
[6/24/20, 1:03:02 PM] Lore: Era un Renault 19 del año 95, era un coche que acá en España era típico hace mil años.. jaja ahora no.. pero yo lo tuve hasta hace poco.. mis amigas se reían de mi..
[6/24/20, 1:03:49 PM] Lore: Le puse nombre, Ramoncito. Jaja por su antiguo dueño, me dio mucha pena. Pero el coche no consumía nada, era cómodo con su asiento de terciopelo jaja y tenía más maletero que el de mis amigas jajaja
[6/24/20, 1:04:45 PM] Lore: Jaja no paro de hablar de él, jaja no sé cómo no te hablé antes.. pobre Ramoncito 🚗
[6/24/20, 1:05:07 PM] Joe: Hahah romancitoooo https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDcxNTI1MzExMDEzNjA5?igshid=l79aoy7fh4k7&story_media_id=2214225930074223088
[6/24/20, 1:06:04 PM] Joe: Aaah it didn’t send you to the right one hahaha but I remember it from the videos in your story. You starting the car 😂 what happened to the car? It finally died?
[6/24/20, 1:06:31 PM] Lore: Ahhhhh jajaja
[6/24/20, 1:06:57 PM] Lore: Ramoncito!!! Sisii ahí estaba intentando arrancarlo jajaj siempre bombeando
‎[6/24/20, 1:07:21 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[6/24/20, 1:07:36 PM] Lore: Pero esa vez hacia frío y le costaba más.. siempre tenía que abrir el capó bombear la gasolina varías d veces y luego con el pie hasta que arrancaba
[6/24/20, 1:08:13 PM] Lore: Jjajajajaja 🙊
[6/24/20, 1:08:52 PM] Joe: You look so happy when it starts hahah. Very cute
[6/24/20, 1:09:24 PM] Lore: Jajaja si si, mucho!
[6/24/20, 1:09:50 PM] Lore: Me fui de viaje a Valencia sola con el coche lleno de cosas para hacer unas fotos de un proyecto
[6/24/20, 1:10:46 PM] Lore: Como a 4hs de Madrid y me quedé tirada en un viaducto por la noche y con temporal. Pasé miedo justo en una curva a oscuras.. y por suerte pudo venir la grúa
[6/24/20, 1:12:11 PM] Lore: Al parecer estaba muerto pero volvió a Madrid y en mi taller me lo arreglaron pero ese día por la noche al parecer no estaba tan arreglado jaja.. a las semanas dio problemas así que lo llevé al desguace 😭 y me vine a Madrid
‎[6/24/20, 1:16:47 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[6/24/20, 1:19:29 PM] Joe: Damn poor car. At least it lived a long life though haha 25 years is a long time for a car.

[6/24/20, 1:33:55 PM] Joe: Hahah the shoes look way more comfortable than heels. I don’t understand how women wear those. They look painful haha
[6/24/20, 1:34:25 PM] Joe: You’re so fuckin cute haha that’s a great picture
[6/24/20, 1:35:41 PM] Joe: Also, that car looks like it was in pretty good shape for as old as it is. We don’t have Renaults here
[6/24/20, 3:38:16 PM] Lore: Eyy estaba con las chicass y se nos alargó la post cena jaja
[6/24/20, 3:40:48 PM] Lore: Los tacones son horribles e incómodos, si me los pongo es para algo muy puntual,hice el esfuerI para la boda de mi amiga jaja pero luego fui a buscar mis zapatillas a Ramoncito

[6/27/20, 12:04:05 AM] Lore: Jajaj pero como es ese coche? Pq no sabes conducirlo?
[6/27/20, 12:07:03 AM] Joe: It’s a stick shift. I’ve only driven auto. My first time driving a manual transmission was a few days ago when he let me drive that car haha
[6/27/20, 12:08:29 AM] Joe: I figured it out quick. I learned already how to drive a stick shift in a video game and it was about the same. But next I have to learn how to slide the car. That’s going to be hella fun. He keeps trying to convince me to buy my own drift car but I don’t want to haha
[6/27/20, 12:09:58 AM] Lore: Ahhhh
[6/27/20, 12:10:16 AM] Lore: Espera que ahí es automático claro, no conducen con marchas?
[6/27/20, 12:10:43 AM] Lore: No sé si estoy entendiendo jajaj no sabes coneucir con palanca de cambios?
[6/27/20, 12:12:46 AM] Lore: Conducir*
[6/27/20, 12:13:29 AM] Joe: Haha yeah his car has a manual gearshift
[6/27/20, 12:14:11 AM] Lore: Jajaj sabes que acá son casi todos manuales no?
[6/27/20, 12:14:25 AM] Joe: Every car I’ve had has been automatic
[6/27/20, 12:14:35 AM] Lore: Si llegamos a alquilar alguno... Jajaja te toca
[6/27/20, 12:15:01 AM] Joe: Good thing I learned now haha

[6/27/20, 12:15:18 AM] Joe: There is probably a lot of good drift cars near you then
[6/27/20, 12:16:14 AM] Joe: Hahaha damn now I want to get my drifting down before i meet you.
[6/27/20, 12:16:45 AM] Joe: So I can scare the shit out of you by sliding the car around
[6/27/20, 12:17:26 AM] Lore: Jajajaj
[6/27/20, 12:18:04 AM] Lore: Mierda me va a tocar a mí 🙊🙈
[6/27/20, 12:18:31 AM] Lore: Yo te iba a decir que te traigas tu carnet de conducir jaja pero no había caído en ese pequeño gran detalle
[6/27/20, 12:21:40 AM] Lore: Que es "drift" me sale significado deriva. No lo entiendo cuando utilizas drift car

[6/27/20, 12:35:09 AM] Joe: Yeah that place looks really nice. I like the patio.
[6/27/20, 12:36:14 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ll have to add that to my notebook. But yeah it’s a controlled skid. Well....hopefully it’s controlled 😂
[6/27/20, 12:37:33 AM] Lore: Tienen otro patio con zanahorias, tomates, etc 😍
[6/27/20, 12:38:17 AM] Joe: Damn that’s hella sick. It’s like in the city too? Not just outside the city or something?
[6/27/20, 12:38:26 AM] Lore: Siguen apareciendo cosas tan diferentes en nuestros estilos de vida jaja
[6/27/20, 12:40:22 AM] Lore: Es en la ciudad, cerca de mi casa. Pero no es centro centro..acá Madrid es que tiene mucho piso, ni hay taaanto con jardín
[6/27/20, 12:41:00 AM] Lore: Ahí el video que me pasaste de Kyle se ve lindo.las casas tienen jardín.aca son más edificios
[6/27/20, 12:45:16 AM] Joe: Yeah it’s a suburban area so lots of houses. It’s an ok little neighborhood, not the best haha but not the worst either
[6/27/20, 1:04:03 AM] Lore: Cuánto cuesta un alquiler ahí por ejemplo?

[6/27/20, 1:11:39 AM] Joe: I believe it’s like $1800, maybe a little more, for their 2 bedroom 1 bathroom. They live in one half of a duplex.
[6/27/20, 1:12:29 AM] Lore: Con jardín también, no está mal.
[6/27/20, 1:13:46 AM] Joe: No not at all. Like i said it’s not the best neighborhood, it can be a little sketchy in that area. But the block he lives on is chill
[6/27/20, 1:15:00 AM] Joe: The architecture near you is way cooler than what’s around here haha
[6/27/20, 1:15:24 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m getting tired. I’ll probably fall asleep really soon

[6/27/20, 8:57:24 AM] Lore: Jaja sí sobretodo plata en algún bolsillo 💵

[6/27/20, 2:59:40 PM] Joe: How much were flights? Super expensive? I haven’t been looking. Just saving my money. I already know I’m going to have to spend a lot for a ticket most likely
[6/27/20, 3:03:34 PM] Joe: Just let me know when you’re ready for a video chat and we can make it happen hahah
[6/27/20, 3:03:44 PM] Lore: Jaja sí??? Me tenés que mostrar esa habilidad

[6/28/20, 11:05:27 AM] Joe: Hahhhhaha shiiiit
[6/28/20, 11:06:23 AM] Joe: I noticed your meals are usually pretty small. I can’t lie, I eat a lot sometimes hahaha but it all gets burned off from skating so it’s cool
[6/28/20, 11:07:39 AM] Lore: Mis comidas pequeñas? Jajaja yo como todo el tiempo, me encanta
[6/28/20, 11:08:52 AM] Lore: Comes mucho? Pensé que no tanto! Sos flaquito
[6/28/20, 11:11:21 AM] Joe: Haha 🤷‍♂️ that’s what it looks like when you send videos or pictures of your meals to me.
[6/28/20, 11:12:05 AM] Joe: But good to know it’s not what it seems like haha
[6/28/20, 11:12:11 AM] Joe: I love food
[6/28/20, 11:13:42 AM] Joe: Yeah I eat a lot. Especially when I’m doing a lot of skating. 

What are you doooing?
[6/28/20, 11:18:36 AM] Lore: Jajaj mmm puede ser que me haya comido algo ya, o que lo combine luego con algo más, o depende el tipo de comida que sea

[6/28/20, 11:32:33 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s hella cute. I need to teach my dog cool tricks when I get one 🐕

[6/28/20, 11:36:51 AM] Lore: Jaja que perro te gustaría tener?
[6/28/20, 11:37:22 AM] Lore: A las 11:30 de la mañana? 😯 Jajaj
[6/28/20, 11:40:24 AM] Joe: Socks hahaha
[6/28/20, 11:41:28 AM] Joe: But honestly I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it too much. I’ll know when I see the dog haha
[6/28/20, 11:42:29 AM] Joe: Hahaha 🙈
[6/28/20, 11:59:20 AM] Lore: Socks parece una buena perra, creo que yo también la querría jaja
[6/28/20, 12:01:00 PM] Lore: Si no sé, tamaño,cualidades..alguna raza o sin raza, algo que te guste, como cola, orejas, etc jaja me refiero a algo que te haga gracia que lo veas y digas ohh
[6/28/20, 12:01:42 PM] Lore: Todos son geniales, pero por ejemplo a mí me encantan las colas largas o las orejas también graciosas
[6/28/20, 12:04:12 PM] Lore: Cariñosos o más independientes, que les guste el agua o no, etc jaja a Rogel por ej. no le gusta el agua 😒
[6/28/20, 12:12:10 PM] Joe: Hmmm I like medium sized short hair dogs. Interesting coloration of the fur is cool to me. I’ll have to pay more attention to what makes me like dogs when I see them.
[6/28/20, 12:13:35 PM] Joe: I do like long tail instead of the little stump tail. And funny ears too. I was having too much fun playing with Sock’a ears cause one is floppy and the other stands up straight
[6/28/20, 12:15:55 PM] Joe: I like an affectionate dog but not to the point where they get overly needy for attention. A nice balance haha
[6/28/20, 12:25:13 PM] Lore: Estas eran las respuestas que quería cuando te hacía la pregunta jajaj
[6/28/20, 12:25:32 PM] Lore: Si te gustan los perros habrá pequeños detalles que pueden gustarte más que otros
[6/28/20, 12:26:20 PM] Lore: Ví esa oreja de socks, la que se queda parada jaja 😍
[6/28/20, 12:28:54 PM] Lore: Me gustan de pelo largo pero no me gusta estar llena de pelos en la ropa.. y me gustaria que pueda subir al sofá o dormir en mi cama, para eso es necesario pelo corto. Me duele mucho cuando lola no puede subir por ese motivo jaja pero intento darle amor desde el suelo... O pongo muchas mantas y algún día sube
[6/28/20, 12:58:10 PM] Joe: Haha that’s why I like short hair. So they can be close to me without shedding too much everywhere.
[6/28/20, 12:59:56 PM] Joe: Haha whoops

[6/29/20, 7:38:38 AM] Joe: Holaaaaa! I’m leaving to camp in a little bit and I have an interview for a temporary position doing some programming work later. Hopefully I get the coding job, it pays really good! Wish me luck haha

[6/29/20, 7:41:55 AM] Lore: Hola! Ah sí? Y eso cómo salió? Que bienn
[6/29/20, 7:42:29 AM] Lore: No necesitas suerte, lo harás bien seguro. Pero si te hace falta te mando toda la suerte del mundo jaja

[6/29/20, 7:47:03 AM] Joe: Haha trust me I need it 😂 but thank you!
[6/29/20, 7:47:40 AM] Joe: It looks so nice out there. Also, there’s a lot of parks around the city it seems like
[6/29/20, 7:48:01 AM] Joe: 🍅
[6/29/20, 7:50:30 AM] Lore: Pero y trabajarías en un sitio fijo o sería a distancia?
[6/29/20, 7:51:21 AM] Lore: Lo que no sepas lo aprendes, así que vos sonreí y decí que estás súper implicado
[6/29/20, 7:52:35 AM] Lore: 🤛 seep
[6/29/20, 7:53:19 AM] Lore: Tomate voy a estar el viernes que me voy a la montaña con mis amigas a bañarme en unos charquitos
[6/29/20, 7:53:23 AM] Joe: I can work from a distance. “Remote work” or whatever.
[6/29/20, 7:53:40 AM] Joe: Haha true. Thanks for the advice.
[6/29/20, 7:54:06 AM] Lore: Si trabajas a distancia siempre podés aprender en casa las cosas que no estés seguro
[6/29/20, 7:54:24 AM] Joe: Oh I can’t wait to see the pictures after you get back 😂 🍅
[6/29/20, 7:55:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m confident in my ability to learn the technology for the project. It’s similar to what I’ve worked with before.
[6/29/20, 7:56:12 AM] Joe: Oh I forgot to tell you how i got it. I actually know the guy from a class I took a few years ago. He messaged me on LinkedIn about the position
‎[6/29/20, 7:56:38 AM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[6/29/20, 7:57:47 AM] Lore: Muy bien, seguridad, empatía  y motivación. Eso en las entrevistas siempre funciona jaja
[6/29/20, 7:59:48 AM] Joe: Haha be careful in the sun. You’re going to get toasted 😂
‎[6/29/20, 8:02:06 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/29/20, 8:02:11 AM] Joe: I’m pretty confident about this one since he approached me and he knows me from a class but we’ll see 🤷‍♂️
[6/29/20, 8:02:20 AM] Joe: 😂 😂
[6/29/20, 8:03:04 AM] Lore: A que hora la tenés?
[6/29/20, 8:05:05 AM] Joe: Around 1
[6/29/20, 8:05:52 AM] Joe: I’m going to work now so I’ll be driving. Barely going to make it on time haha. I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
[6/29/20, 8:06:58 AM] Lore: Suerte!! Yo acabo de llegar a casa y voy a comer un pollo delicioso!!!! Que hice hoy a las 8AM jaja
[6/29/20, 8:07:04 AM] Lore: 😘
[6/29/20, 11:48:55 AM] Joe: I’m almost free haha. I’m so tired and hungry. I’m going to eat, talk to the guy about the job, and probably take a nap. I had zero energy today for some reason
‎[6/29/20, 12:51:36 PM] Lore: ‎audio omitted
[6/29/20, 12:52:46 PM] Lore: "Hola, bueno te mando un audio para desearte mucha suerte para la entrevista que seguro que te va a salir genial y si no, no pasa nada.. bueno después me contás cómo te fue, un besito lindo chau!"
[6/29/20, 1:45:27 PM] Joe: It went pretty good! He said he will email me later with more details. But it sounds like a cool gig. $1500/week to code 1-2 features every 2 weeks. All remote work so I can work from anywhere. I hope this works out. It would be perfect
[6/29/20, 2:07:43 PM] Lore: Que biennn
[6/29/20, 2:09:49 PM] Lore: 1500 dol por semana o cada dos semanas? Es muchísimo!
[6/29/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: $1500 every week. So $6000/month. But that’s before taxes. And doing the math it’s about $78,000/year which isn’t great for software developers but I’ll take it haha. Something to pad the resume with so I can get the big money later. Writing code pays really well, it’s just hard to find work sometimes.
[6/29/20, 2:22:59 PM] Joe: We’ll see what happens. Hopefully it works out. I still have to learn some new technologies I haven’t worked with. Ooooh I’m excited haha
[6/29/20, 3:02:58 PM] Lore: Bombón!!!!
[6/29/20, 3:03:02 PM] Lore: Cuánto me alegro!!!!!
‎[6/29/20, 3:06:01 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/29/20, 3:10:04 PM] Lore: Esta muy bien pagado!!! Además ganarás más experiencia!
[6/29/20, 3:11:03 PM] Lore: Mierda perdona no haberte respondido rápido cuando lo leí , quería felicitarte mejor!
[6/29/20, 3:12:46 PM] Joe: Thank you thank you! 😊
[6/29/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I was eating
[6/29/20, 3:15:11 PM] Lore: Y cuando empezas a trabajar?
[6/29/20, 3:18:09 PM] Joe: He didn’t email me yet but I’m assuming it would be in a week or two.
[6/29/20, 3:18:50 PM] Joe: I’m going to keep myself from getting too excited in case he never emails me 😂
‎[6/29/20, 3:19:46 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/29/20, 3:19:48 PM] Lore: Te lo va a enviaaarrr

‎[6/29/20, 3:20:45 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[6/29/20, 3:20:53 PM] Lore: Que bien, me alegroo de verdad!
[6/29/20, 3:21:41 PM] Lore: Y por cuánto tiempo sería?
[6/29/20, 3:22:24 PM] Joe: You’re probably right. He wouldn’t tell me he would email me if he wasn’t going to.
[6/29/20, 3:23:07 PM] Joe: I don’t know for how long. Seemed like an ongoing project. I’ll have to see what the contract looks like that he sends
[6/29/20, 3:23:43 PM] Lore: Ahhh
[6/29/20, 3:24:12 PM] Lore: Y cuántas horas trabajarás por día?
[6/29/20, 3:24:35 PM] Lore: Y cómo es el tipo de trabajo, son webs o es otra cosa de codificación? Jaja 🙄
[6/29/20, 3:25:35 PM] Joe: It’s not really going to have hours per day. More like, get the work done within 2 weeks. Work however long and whenever you need to so you can finish it
[6/29/20, 3:26:20 PM] Joe: Haha it’s an app for IOS and Android
[6/29/20, 3:26:40 PM] Lore: Ahhh y de qué es la app?
‎[6/29/20, 3:27:44 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[6/29/20, 3:30:42 PM] Joe: It’s some music app or something like that.
[6/29/20, 3:32:06 PM] Joe: Not too sure. It’s something about music recommendations and it will work with different music apps. I don’t know. He didn’t explain it super well but it sounded interesting

[6/30/20, 6:18:09 AM] Lore: I'm proud that you got that job....and if it is remote better haha
[6/30/20, 7:10:01 AM] Joe: Hahah I’m definitely trying to talk more than just good morning and goodnight!
[6/30/20, 7:10:33 AM] Joe: Thanks babe. I’m stoked.
[6/30/20, 7:13:06 AM] Joe: I need to start waking up earlier again. Then I can talk to you in the mornings for longer before I go to work. I’ve been lazy lately, waking up at the last minute
[6/30/20, 7:13:26 AM] Joe: And I always fall asleep right around the time you wake up haha
[6/30/20, 7:14:24 AM] Lore: Jaja y yo m quedó dormida justo cuando estás libre
[6/30/20, 7:14:29 AM] Lore: Quedo*
[6/30/20, 7:14:44 AM] Lore: Es que no puedo controlarlo hoy fue como mierda jaja otra vez
[6/30/20, 7:14:53 AM] Lore: 🤗
[6/30/20, 7:15:30 AM] Lore: Joe estoy deprimida si nos vuelven a encerrar en Madrid que hay rumores de un "rebrote" no vas a poder venir 😭

[6/30/20, 7:31:58 AM] Joe: So it’s perfect
[6/30/20, 7:32:51 AM] Joe: I have Apple Music and they make a favorite playlist every week. This week is the first time they added some of the spanish music you sent me haha. I must be listening to it a lot
[6/30/20, 7:34:14 AM] Lore: Jaja perfecto no sería, estarías encerrado en tu viaje . Eso es tremendo
[6/30/20, 7:34:43 AM] Lore: Bueno veremos que pasa..tengo ganas que te den el pasaporte aunque sea solo x verlo jaja

[6/30/20, 7:43:19 AM] Joe: Mmmm 😋
[6/30/20, 7:44:48 AM] Joe: They put a song by Los Delinqüentes. Tartarichi. I listen to their album a lot haha

[6/30/20, 7:52:54 AM] Joe: Hahah I don’t go a pick that song to listen to. It just plays a lot from when I play the album
[6/30/20, 7:52:54 AM] Lore: Muy flamenca
[6/30/20, 7:53:36 AM] Lore: Tartariii no te alejes de miii

[6/30/20, 7:58:34 AM] Joe: I was wondering when Apple was going to start recommending music in spanish haha
[6/30/20, 8:01:36 AM] Joe: I’m going to work now. I’m doing a 12 hour shift again but I can still talk to you during the shift. I don’t do much while I monitor the park.
[6/30/20, 8:02:05 AM] Joe: Promise I’ll start getting up a little earlier so we can talk more. I miss talking to you as much as we used to be able to.
[6/30/20, 8:03:02 AM] Lore: Jajaja tenemos que repasar algo más de música para que aprendas lo que dicen las letras
[6/30/20, 8:03:46 AM] Lore: Upps, hoy es el día largo! Bueno espero que se haga ameno, si hablame estaré por casa seguramente!
[6/30/20, 8:04:30 AM] Joe: Hahah true. I learn some of the songs and don’t even know what I’m saying 😂

[6/30/20, 11:00:05 PM] Joe: Haha dammit I’m going to sleep right now 😞 I’m so tired. But I have my alarm set to an earlier time to message you in the morning
[6/30/20, 11:02:10 PM] Lore: Jaja tranquilo...si estás cansado no te despiertes pronto.. Descansa!
[7/1/20, 5:44:36 AM] Joe: Mmm I slept so good. I passed out pretty much instantly after sending that last message. I am sore today. Too much skating yesterday.

[7/1/20, 7:50:03 AM] Joe: He said we’ll talk more today and possibly start “on boarding”. Not sure if I’ll actually start working or just get setup with access to the codebase and all that.
[7/1/20, 7:50:19 AM] Joe: Do the contract and non-disclosures and all that

[7/1/20, 10:41:39 AM] Joe: Hahaha I figured. You said you don’t even really like the idea of marriage that much.
[7/1/20, 10:42:17 AM] Joe: But that’s good. I hope that goes well. I should’ve used all my extra time this morning to make breakfast or pack a lunch. I’m hella hungry

[7/1/20, 10:44:21 AM] Lore: Jaja mierda, algunas cosas si que me prestas atención y te acordás jajaj

[7/1/20, 11:33:58 AM] Joe: Sorry I was attending to injured children. They were dropping like flys for a minute there
[7/1/20, 11:34:41 AM] Joe: Getting through a whole day with no injuries is tough
[7/1/20, 11:37:03 AM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[7/1/20, 11:38:04 AM] Lore: Te dejo trabajar tranquilo, hablamos en otro momento. Suerte con la reunión del nuevo trabajo. 😘

[7/1/20, 1:46:19 PM] Joe: I don’t know when this guy is going to call me 🤷‍♂️ still waiting
[7/1/20, 2:12:10 PM] Lore: Te llamó ya?
‎[7/1/20, 2:14:06 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/1/20, 2:15:02 PM] Joe: I guess I told him I’m free after 1pm and he never really confirmed the exact time he would contact me. So I guess I just have to wait around for his call
[7/1/20, 2:17:10 PM] Lore: Jajaja oiiish
[7/1/20, 2:17:19 PM] Lore: Ahh no habías confirmado!
[7/1/20, 2:17:38 PM] Lore: Pero escribile, decile.. sobre qué hora crees que podemos reunirnos, para organizarme el día . Gracias o algo así no?
[7/1/20, 2:19:44 PM] Joe: Yesterday he was free after 3pm so I’m assuming he’ll call around that time. I’m not doing anything anyway so it’s fine
[7/1/20, 2:19:56 PM] Lore: Sobre todo para saber si te agarra comiendo o después de econer
[7/1/20, 2:20:27 PM] Lore: *Comer
[7/1/20, 2:21:05 PM] Joe: I just finished eating some ribs. I do kind of want another snack though 🤔
[7/1/20, 2:27:16 PM] Lore: Jaja nosotras acá comimos varias cositas ricas también con un vino con limón que acá se toma mucho "tinto de verano"
‎[7/1/20, 2:28:10 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/1/20, 2:31:14 PM] Joe: I’m just going to keep eating snacks until he calls. I think I might have some grapes or something
[7/1/20, 2:32:57 PM] Joe: Interesting choice haha is it good? I don’t think I’ve had a wine with lemon in it
[7/1/20, 2:59:50 PM] Lore: Jaja sí está muy rico es típico de verano en España
[7/1/20, 2:59:57 PM] Lore: 😋😋😋
[7/1/20, 3:00:07 PM] Lore: Todo diferente a tu cultura jaja

[7/1/20, 3:10:34 PM] Lore: Ohhh
[7/1/20, 3:12:18 PM] Lore: Bueno tendrás que fijar con el día y hora
[7/1/20, 3:13:22 PM] Lore: Yo justo en mi habitación, ya con el ventilador jaja

[7/1/20, 3:16:48 PM] Joe: He just never confirmed when he would contact me. Terrible.
[7/1/20, 3:16:50 PM] Joe: Oh well
[7/1/20, 3:17:51 PM] Lore: Dejale un mensaje, para que sepa que estás pendiente y que podés reunirte con el en otro momento
[7/1/20, 3:19:54 PM] Joe: True. Alright maybe I’ll send a text or something.
[7/1/20, 3:20:18 PM] Lore: Sabes que te echo de menos, verdad?
[7/1/20, 3:20:22 PM] Lore: Jaja
[7/1/20, 3:23:00 PM] Joe: Awww no I didn’t knooow

[7/1/20, 3:28:11 PM] Lore: Pero preferiría que estés cerca jaja y poder pasar tiempo con vos, de verdad. Ya la distancia no me esta haciendo gracia porque tengo ganas de verte jajaj no contaba con esto
[7/1/20, 3:29:51 PM] Joe: Aaah so shitty. The US is having a cases go up and talking about slowing down opening up. I hate it.
[7/1/20, 3:30:36 PM] Joe: Saaaame. They can lock us down as long as they want if I can just get to you first.
[7/1/20, 3:30:54 PM] Joe: I just don’t want to be so far away anymore
‎[7/1/20, 3:32:20 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted

[7/1/20, 3:37:53 PM] Joe: People keeps asking if I’m staying for good since I came back from Hawaii...I always tell them I want to go to Spain when I can
[7/1/20, 3:39:44 PM] Lore: Jajaj oissh y cuáles son las opiniones?

[7/1/20, 3:42:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah the people that I tell why I’m going know
[7/1/20, 3:52:11 PM] Joe: I bet some people think it’s a little crazy and don’t want to say anything haha. But I really don’t see why not
[7/1/20, 3:54:23 PM] Lore: Jajaja seguro
[7/1/20, 3:55:34 PM] Lore: Yo misma lo pensaba, ahora ya me da igual. Quiero que pase jaja omg estoy trabajando la paciencia mucho 😅

[7/1/20, 3:59:38 PM] Joe: Honestly when you told me you didn’t have much patience early on, I was a little nervous that you wouldn’t wait. I’m really glad you’re holding out so long haha
[7/1/20, 3:59:47 PM] Joe: Hahaha

[7/2/20, 6:51:34 AM] Lore: A que hora quedas con el?
[7/2/20, 6:52:22 AM] Joe: Haha I want to see how you interact with people in general but I would especially like to see this “less polite” Lore 😂
[7/2/20, 6:52:35 AM] Joe: 1pm again haha
[7/2/20, 6:57:34 AM] Lore: Jajaja dicen que soy buena interactuando con la gente, vendiendo y eso ...pero depende de mí día.. si son pijos o famosos suelo ser menos simpática jaja no sé.. los ayudo menos... ellos son siempre más privilegiados..Por ejemplo si viene un señor que no tiene ni idea que elegir o una chica que no tiene mucho dinero, me involucro muchísimo más jaja . Seguramente mis jefes no están de acuerdo con esto
[7/2/20, 6:58:26 AM] Lore: Biennn!! seguro que sale genial. Tenés que ir al skatepark hoy no?
[7/2/20, 7:03:32 AM] Joe: Hahaha the bosses probably hate that 😂 I like it though.

[7/2/20, 7:44:05 AM] Joe: That’s good. I was hella trying to remember the one you like to drink. Alhambra especial 1933 or something like that hahah I don’t remember exactly.

[7/2/20, 7:45:18 AM] Lore: De hecho antes de irme a costa rica me fui unos meses a casa de mis padres
[7/2/20, 7:45:41 AM] Lore: Ah si, la va a vender?
[7/2/20, 7:45:43 AM] Lore: Se mudan a otra casa?
[7/2/20, 7:46:40 AM] Joe: They’re going to move to Hawaii most likely. Join the rest of the family that’s out there haha.
[7/2/20, 7:46:48 AM] Lore: Jajajaj 💛 Alhambra 1925
[7/2/20, 7:46:57 AM] Lore: Buena memoria rulitos
[7/2/20, 7:47:00 AM] Joe: Shit I was close hahah
[7/2/20, 7:47:27 AM] Lore: 😲😲
[7/2/20, 7:48:03 AM] Lore: Jaja qué bueno! Nelly y Boom Boom se quedan en California?
[7/2/20, 7:49:10 AM] Joe: Yeah but I have lots of cousins, uncles, and aunts still here in California. Boom Boom says Hawaii is too hot for him. He doesn’t like it 😂
[7/2/20, 7:49:52 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 7:50:10 AM] Lore: Boom boom va a estar encantado con el tamaño de las paltas de Hawaii
[7/2/20, 7:53:18 AM] Joe: Haha true. He was excited about his little avocados on his tree so he’d love those big Hawaiian avocados.
[7/2/20, 7:55:09 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 7:55:21 AM] Lore: Creo que su nieto será así en un futuro también cuando sea viejo
[7/2/20, 7:55:46 AM] Lore: Nunca taardee
[7/2/20, 7:59:50 AM] Joe: Hahaha
[7/2/20, 8:00:20 AM] Joe: It’s time for me to go to work now 😔
[7/2/20, 8:01:01 AM] Joe: I’ll talk to you when I get a chance. Enjoy your evening.

[7/2/20, 9:01:52 AM] Lore: Jaja me encanta poner los pies en agua 👵
[7/2/20, 9:12:06 AM] Joe: Hahahah that looks way more comfortable
[7/2/20, 9:12:30 AM] Joe: I’m done checking in kids so I get to take off the goggles now
[7/2/20, 9:12:57 AM] Joe: But I have to do stretches now and start skating I guess
[7/2/20, 9:13:54 AM] Lore: Les enseñas un truco y ellos lo repiten? Jjj
[7/2/20, 10:02:09 AM] Joe: Only if they ask. They’re doing their own thing mostly now. Learning from each other and I just give tips now and then
‎[7/2/20, 12:30:41 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 12:31:55 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 12:32:03 PM] Lore: Como fue con esos enanitos?
[7/2/20, 12:34:04 PM] Joe: It was pretty good today. No camp tomorrow so I just have to work on the coding stuff once the guy calls me
‎[7/2/20, 12:35:54 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[7/2/20, 12:36:15 PM] Lore: Perfecto!
[7/2/20, 12:40:46 PM] Joe: Sky is pretty. Have fun. Where you going?
[7/2/20, 12:41:12 PM] Lore: A la sierra
[7/2/20, 12:41:52 PM] Lore: A casa de mis padres hoy y mañana con mis amigas de ahí, vamos a la montaña
[7/2/20, 12:42:49 PM] Lore: No trabajo el viernes así que aprovecho para salir de la ciudad
[7/2/20, 12:43:10 PM] Lore: Y ya me dieron vacaciones! Estamos viendo con mis amigas para ir a la playa 💃
[7/2/20, 12:46:43 PM] Joe: Sweeeeet
[7/2/20, 12:47:39 PM] Joe: That’s awesome. I almost had a 3 day weekend but I feel I’m going to spend most of it learning the technology for the job haha.
[7/2/20, 12:50:55 PM] Lore: Jaja y que estuviste haciendo por las tardes últimamente? El skatepark era solo por la mañana, excepto los días mortíferos de 12 jaja
[7/2/20, 1:05:12 PM] Joe: Either go skate and film, try to learn some coding stuff or some more spanish, or go to my friends house. Depends on the day but usually i get lunch after i get off then decide what to do.
[7/2/20, 1:09:14 PM] Lore: Jaja es que como en ese horario yo estoy súper dormida no sabia bien que hacías jaja
[7/2/20, 1:09:29 PM] Lore: Ya me enseñarás algo de eso que grabaste
[7/2/20, 1:09:50 PM] Lore: Español seguís practicando con Nelly o cómo lo haces? Jaja
[7/2/20, 1:13:42 PM] Lore: Estoy nerviosa por ver a mis perras jaja
[7/2/20, 1:15:02 PM] Joe: Oh yeah i guess that's true.
[7/2/20, 1:16:32 PM] Joe: I have nothing to teach you haha i learn in a weird way. I just listen to stuff i don't know and keep looking up words until it sticks. I never feel like i learned something at the end of the day. I only notice it's working when i don't have to use the translator as much or i understand something i didn't before
[7/2/20, 1:17:17 PM] Joe: I'm really trying to practice hearing all the words that people say but it's hard to know when some words end and others start when i don't know the word they're saying in the first place haha
[7/2/20, 1:17:48 PM] Joe: They're going to be soo happy to see you
[7/2/20, 2:16:23 PM] Lore: Ay Joe pero sabes que podés aprender conmigo!
[7/2/20, 2:16:53 PM] Joe: I learn every time i talk to you a little more
[7/2/20, 2:16:55 PM] Lore: Todo lo que necesites, podemos practicar para que aprendas..! Pregúntale lo que quieras
[7/2/20, 2:17:18 PM] Lore: *Pregúntame
[7/2/20, 2:18:02 PM] Joe: Haha i mean, there isn't anything in particular i think i need to learn. Not that i can think of anyway. But i have been picking up a lot from talking to you.
[7/2/20, 2:18:43 PM] Joe: I don't have to use the translator as often haha and sometimes i use it just to double check or because i don't know only a few of the words. I'm getting better
[7/2/20, 2:18:49 PM] Lore: Y más vas a aprender cuando estés delante jajaja
[7/2/20, 2:18:53 PM] Lore: Blablabla
[7/2/20, 2:19:36 PM] Joe: hahah i can't wait
[7/2/20, 2:20:09 PM] Joe: it'll be pretty funny haha damn hopefully i can communicate enough to keep you entertained
‎[7/2/20, 2:20:13 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 2:20:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[7/2/20, 2:20:43 PM] Lore: Yo

[7/2/20, 2:23:08 PM] Joe: Hahaha dammit
[7/2/20, 2:23:14 PM] Lore: Jajaja seguro que si
[7/2/20, 2:23:26 PM] Joe: Yeah but what about when i talk to you? That'll be good too haha
[7/2/20, 2:23:34 PM] Lore: Aunque yo también seré Trump seguramente
[7/2/20, 2:23:39 PM] Joe: blahblahblah
[7/2/20, 2:23:47 PM] Lore: Y vos esa niña jajaj
[7/2/20, 2:23:58 PM] Lore: Jajaja sisii
[7/2/20, 2:24:00 PM] Joe: ahha for sure
‎[7/2/20, 2:25:02 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 2:25:55 PM] Joe: How? Freak out?
[7/2/20, 2:25:58 PM] Joe: hahaha
[7/2/20, 2:26:13 PM] Joe: I'm going to be the best mime in the world
[7/2/20, 2:27:24 PM] Lore: Jjajjaaja
[7/2/20, 2:29:19 PM] Lore: Yo te robaré un beso o te molestaré cuando no entienda
[7/2/20, 2:30:13 PM] Joe: Hahaha i like it. Totally fine with me 😂
[7/2/20, 2:35:42 PM] Lore: Jajaj no, seré buena
[7/2/20, 2:36:08 PM] Lore: 😇😇😇
[7/2/20, 2:40:33 PM] Joe: I'm really excited. Things are falling into place, except the possibility of another quarantine. But i have the passport coming and now i got my remote job.
[7/2/20, 2:40:46 PM] Joe: I wish i could just go today hahah mother fuckers
[7/2/20, 2:41:14 PM] Joe: I'm trying to read all these different things about the project i'm supposed to do for the guy haha
[7/2/20, 2:41:25 PM] Joe: https://gaugr.com/gaugrtools
[7/2/20, 2:41:39 PM] Joe: this is the tool or whatever that i'm going to work on
[7/2/20, 2:56:37 PM] Lore: Jajaja lo importante es que vamos superando todas estas putas diferencias horarias a pesar de que estamos trabajando.. pero por favor, una segunda cuarentena no,  pq eso significaría que cerrarían nuestras fronteras jaja
[7/2/20, 2:57:39 PM] Lore: Jajaja 😏 te como
[7/2/20, 2:58:31 PM] Joe: We’ve been talking a lot still I think. Just not as much as the beginning of quarantine haha. I was talking to you all day every day
[7/2/20, 3:06:05 PM] Lore: Si estos días estuve mirando todas nuestras fotos que nos fuimos pasando jaja y videos
[7/2/20, 3:07:54 PM] Lore: Y la verdad es que teníamos tanto tiempo!!! Ahora que ya forjamos la base.. nuestra conversación ya no es tanto saber que nos gusta, ya nos conocemos algo
[7/2/20, 3:09:05 PM] Lore: Ahora nuestra conversacion general es desearnos los buenos días o las buenas noches, y lo que nos echamos de menos y queremos vernos jajaja 🤷
[7/2/20, 3:09:14 PM] Joe: haha for sure! I have a really big album full of the videos and pictures you send me
[7/2/20, 3:10:14 PM] Joe: That's very true. I guess i've already asked a lot of the main things i wanted to know about you. We kind of skipped the small talk but now we can't escape it hahah
[7/2/20, 3:11:02 PM] Joe: I'll have to think of some deep dark secret or something to tell you. Spice it up haha. Or i need to come up with some good questions.
[7/2/20, 3:13:09 PM] Lore: Jaja tranquilo no me importa, no tengo que hablar de cosas fabulosas simplemente compartir algo con vos esta bien
[7/2/20, 3:14:51 PM] Lore: Las cosas que ví de vos son las que me gustan, tu forma de pensar o ver la vida, tu personalidad. Creo que podría pasar un buen rato cuando te vea
[7/2/20, 3:19:54 PM] Joe: Yeah i like the same things about you. My mom was asking me what i like about you and that was basically the list i gave her. The way you look at life and your personality. I like to hear you laugh and i'm always smiling when i listen to the audio clips you send or watch the videos. Standing there like an idiot smiling with my phone in my hand hahah 😂😂
[7/2/20, 3:20:17 PM] Joe: Don't even understand half of what i'm hearing too haha
[7/2/20, 3:21:36 PM] Joe: But you seem "lighthearted" to me. And the fact that you would even entertain the idea of me visiting you and how you pursued me, i find it all very interesting haha
[7/2/20, 3:40:48 PM] Lore: Jajaja yo también. Mis amigas cada vez que me ven con una sonrisa tonta y que dejo de hablar me dicen, es Joe?
[7/2/20, 3:43:36 PM] Lore: Jaja yo hay veces que los vuelvo a ver cómo ayer y entiendo alguna cosa más.. jaja aunque hay veces que es como vgjjvfffnj
[7/2/20, 3:46:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i try to speak slowly and clearly as i can. Sometimes i forget. And the mask makes it extra difficult to understand me i'm sure
[7/2/20, 3:46:58 PM] Lore: Jajaja sin duda me pareció interesante lo "tímido/introvertido" que eras
[7/2/20, 3:47:01 PM] Joe: It's funny, when you talk fast, the first time i listen i don't hear anything haha but after i pick up the words i can't stop hearing it when i listen again. Practicing listening to you really helps
[7/2/20, 3:47:11 PM] Lore: Inocente muchas veces jajaja
[7/2/20, 3:48:24 PM] Joe: Haha you were definitely good at making me nervous at the beginning. Always making me do stuff a little outside of my normal
[7/2/20, 3:48:54 PM] Joe: It was good though. It made it fun. Like when you started asking me to send you audio in spanish 😂 oh god
[7/2/20, 3:49:17 PM] Joe: I would try so hard to not sound absolutely ridiculous haha
[7/2/20, 3:49:23 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[7/2/20, 3:49:24 PM] Joe: ronronear
[7/2/20, 3:49:47 PM] Lore: La verdad es que te "lo curraste"
[7/2/20, 3:50:21 PM] Lore: Es como que hacías cosas para divertirme o te pedía cosas "locas" y las hacías
[7/2/20, 3:51:13 PM] Joe: Haha yeah like going in the water so early in the morning
[7/2/20, 3:51:21 PM] Joe: oooh that was so cold haha
[7/2/20, 3:51:28 PM] Lore: Y todos los suyos bonitos de Hawaii mientras yo estaba encerrada jaja
[7/2/20, 3:51:30 PM] Joe: It was nice though
[7/2/20, 3:52:07 PM] Lore: Sii ese vídeo!! Jaja y el que estabas bailando los delincuentes 🙊
[7/2/20, 3:52:15 PM] Joe: I bet that helped a lot. I was your window into the outside world.
[7/2/20, 3:52:46 PM] Joe: Aaaaah hahaha i forgot about that one hahahaha
[7/2/20, 3:52:47 PM] Joe: shit
[7/2/20, 3:53:12 PM] Joe: Well...i told you i'd send you a video of those things, so i did
[7/2/20, 3:53:12 PM] Lore: Todos los vídeos son geniales, pero mucho se esconden entre tantos gif jajaj
[7/2/20, 3:54:37 PM] Lore: El video de las gorras lo vi hoy jaja te quedaba tan bien la primera, deberías ponertela más
[7/2/20, 3:54:46 PM] Joe: I don't know why but when i watch a video you send from WhatsApp it downloads it to my phone. So i made an album with all the stuff you send me. Easy to find...i'll save them for when i need to embarrass you haha
[7/2/20, 3:55:13 PM] Joe: Just kidding i wouldn't do that, don't stop sending videos😂
[7/2/20, 3:56:24 PM] Joe: What? Which one?
[7/2/20, 3:57:01 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 3:57:09 PM] Lore: Yo hay algunos que tengo guardados
[7/2/20, 3:57:41 PM] Lore: Guardaré el resto!
[7/2/20, 3:58:41 PM] Lore: Tenía guardado también el del short azul jajajaja y un día hicimos una foto con mi móvil y mis amigas justo estaban con mi teléfono y yo 🙄😱 jaja pero lo agarré rápidamente
[7/2/20, 3:59:39 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha shiiiiit
[7/2/20, 3:59:51 PM] Joe: I knew i shouldn't have sent those 😂
[7/2/20, 3:59:52 PM] Lore: Una negra, spitwire puede ser? La carita con la llama
[7/2/20, 4:00:22 PM] Joe: Seriously that's the first time i've every taken a picture and sent it to someone like that haha
[7/2/20, 4:00:51 PM] Lore: Me costó que lo hagas!! Jaja la primera vez que lo intenté me ignoraste jaja
[7/2/20, 4:01:15 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, spitfire haha
[7/2/20, 4:01:18 PM] Lore: 😏😏😏
[7/2/20, 4:01:42 PM] Joe: Wait did I? I don't remember hahaha
[7/2/20, 4:01:55 PM] Lore: Y cuando me despierto algún día veo el de los pantalones negros
[7/2/20, 4:02:02 PM] Lore: 🤫🤫🤫
[7/2/20, 4:02:03 PM] Joe: Haha i don't know how you convinced me to do so much from so far away
[7/2/20, 4:02:46 PM] Joe: 🙉🙈🙈 Aaaaah hahah delete them 😂

[7/2/20, 4:06:02 PM] Lore: eseeee jajaj
[7/2/20, 4:06:13 PM] Lore: Recuerdo que lo intenté una vez
[7/2/20, 4:06:31 PM] Lore: Aunque nunca a un desconocido se lo había "planteado"
[7/2/20, 4:06:57 PM] Lore: Y al final terminé preguntándote si eras asexual jajajaja
[7/2/20, 4:07:58 PM] Joe: Hahahaha that was so strange to me when you asked that. I was thinking to myself, "what kind of vibes am i giving off here!?"
[7/2/20, 4:08:55 PM] Lore: 👆
[7/2/20, 4:08:56 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 4:10:23 PM] Lore: A mí me gusta cuando lo hacemos
[7/2/20, 4:11:15 PM] Joe: Saaame
[7/2/20, 4:12:25 PM] Joe: Damn i like how i've done things with you that i haven't done with anyone else haha. All cause of the distance. But it's such a different way of getting to know someone. There is literally no option to skip the talking part of it all
[7/2/20, 4:13:29 PM] Lore: O te sentís un poco incómodo con eso del"sexo via WhatsApp"? Jaja
[7/2/20, 4:14:20 PM] Joe: No i don't feel uncomfortable with it. I enjoyed it haha
[7/2/20, 4:15:15 PM] Joe: I must really like you to be convinced to do it in the first place though haha. Shit, i didn't even have WhatsApp until you told me to download it so we could get off instagram
[7/2/20, 4:15:36 PM] Lore: Jajaj si muy diferente, pero como muy natural y sincero..
[7/2/20, 4:16:16 PM] Joe: Exactly 😊
[7/2/20, 4:16:37 PM] Lore: En primer lugar el que?
[7/2/20, 4:17:40 PM] Lore: quiero que tengas la iniciativa algún día de volver a repetirlo jajaj cuando creas que podés estar super horny jajaja eso lo aprendí de vos
[7/2/20, 4:17:59 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha to be convinced to have "WhatsApp sex" in the first place hahah
[7/2/20, 4:19:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i only got super horny because you sent me sexy videos. Mmmmm very sexy videos lasnjdob
[7/2/20, 4:20:35 PM] Joe: I'll try to take the initiative sometime haha sorry, i'm not great at that from a distance.

[7/2/20, 4:25:31 PM] Joe: Mmm hahah you make this difficult for me 😂

[7/2/20, 4:34:45 PM] Lore: Jajaj me está ahogando y encima estaba teniendo una pesadilla
[7/2/20, 4:36:19 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look trapped

[7/2/20, 4:43:11 PM] Lore: Jajaj es tan linda, jaja no necesito dormir con nadie así jajaj
[7/2/20, 4:43:33 PM] Joe: I want some animals to cuddle with me haha. Dookie still isn’t feeling well so he isn’t having any of my shit when I try to get him to sit near me
[7/2/20, 4:44:16 PM] Lore: Dookie cual es? El de los pedos?
[7/2/20, 4:44:21 PM] Joe: Hah there won’t be any room for me when the dogs are around
[7/2/20, 4:44:41 PM] Lore: Socks si está con vos cómo Kenya conmigo jaja tan cariñosos
‎[7/2/20, 4:45:36 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[7/2/20, 4:46:09 PM] Joe: Those are his favorite treats and he is usually a little fatty so he must not be feeling well since he isn’t really eating
[7/2/20, 4:46:21 PM] Lore: Jajaj para vos siempre hay lugar jajaj
[7/2/20, 4:46:57 PM] Lore: Ahhh el gato jajaj
[7/2/20, 4:47:21 PM] Lore: Ohhh es verdad
[7/2/20, 4:47:22 PM] Joe: True. I love socks.
[7/2/20, 4:47:34 PM] Lore: No te pregunté cómo le había ido en el veterinario
[7/2/20, 4:47:55 PM] Lore: Soy lo peor! 😖
[7/2/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, they didn’t really find much. They ended up saying he has acid reflex or something like that. But then he had another appointment and might have some kind of infection
[7/2/20, 4:48:53 PM] Lore: 🤔
[7/2/20, 4:48:54 PM] Joe: Naaaaah, the best
[7/2/20, 4:49:23 PM] Lore: Ácid Reflex? Que viene a ser eso?
[7/2/20, 4:49:28 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t know what’s wrong with him but he has an attitude and doesn’t like to be touched right now but usually he doesn’t mind
[7/2/20, 4:50:59 PM] Lore: Ohhhhh
[7/2/20, 4:51:17 PM] Lore: Pobreee Doockie!!!
[7/2/20, 4:51:54 PM] Joe: Yeah poor little dude. He is super grumpy haha

[7/2/20, 4:52:49 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 4:53:34 PM] Lore: El pelo de elvis podría llegarme hasta acá jaja
[7/2/20, 4:53:47 PM] Lore: Tiene pinta de soltar mucho pelo
[7/2/20, 4:54:05 PM] Lore: Pero es cariñoso jjj
[7/2/20, 4:54:59 PM] Lore: Okey ví a Dookie, Vi a Elvis, me falta otro principal jjj
[7/2/20, 4:57:04 PM] Joe: That’s all of the pets here. Socks and Biggie are my friends dogs.
[7/2/20, 4:57:46 PM] Joe: Oh yeah Elvis has super long hair and leaves it everywhere. He’s a cool cat though. Let’s you pick him up and carry him like a baby hahah
[7/2/20, 4:58:28 PM] Lore: Vos faltas, vos jaja en video
[7/2/20, 4:58:54 PM] Joe: Hahahhh whoops 😂
[7/2/20, 4:58:57 PM] Lore: Jajaja Joe papi

[7/2/20, 5:05:30 PM] Joe: Here is a video of my ugly face 😚
[7/2/20, 5:25:01 PM] Lore: Jaja por suerte esto puedo entenderlo jaja
[7/2/20, 5:25:54 PM] Lore: Mentira 🤫
[7/2/20, 5:28:37 PM] Joe: I honestly don’t have a good grasp on how much English you know haha I know that you know some for sure. I guess it’s hard to describe how much you know and don’t know.
[7/2/20, 5:29:07 PM] Joe: I wonder if you know more english than I know spanish 🤔
[7/2/20, 5:31:21 PM] Lore: Mmm jajaj
[7/2/20, 5:31:40 PM] Lore: No lo sé tampoco, depende lo atenta que este
[7/2/20, 5:38:00 PM] Joe: Well if I’m coming to Spain I’ll probably have more spanish than you have english eventually. But then if you want to come to the US to see me you’ll need to learn more engliiish
[7/2/20, 5:38:16 PM] Joe: So you can go to Hawaii hahaha
[7/2/20, 5:38:56 PM] Joe: I’m looking forward to visiting you in Spain but it would be the dream to be on an island with you somewhere in the world haha. One day
[7/2/20, 5:41:00 PM] Lore: Jajaj yo aprenderé inglés menor también para que no sientas tanta presión
[7/2/20, 5:42:01 PM] Lore: Jajaja tendré que casarme para que Trump me deje entrar
[7/2/20, 5:42:58 PM] Joe: You’ll just have to have a “green card marriage” hahaha
[7/2/20, 5:43:05 PM] Joe: Just kidding just kidding
[7/2/20, 5:43:22 PM] Lore: Aunque le pregunté a una amiga y creo que tampoco es tan difícil pq vivo en España, tengo firmado un contrato de casa y trabajo
[7/2/20, 5:44:06 PM] Joe: I’m sure you’ll be able to come at least to visit someday. Fuck Trump haha
[7/2/20, 5:44:11 PM] Lore: Jajaj buuu
[7/2/20, 5:44:47 PM] Joe: We’ll go on the tv show “90 day fiancé” 😂
[7/2/20, 5:45:43 PM] Lore: Jaja eso sería genial!!! Volver a costa rica, tengo amigos ahí aún y ahí se habla mucho inglés y mucho español. Ambos por igual
‎[7/2/20, 5:47:21 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 5:47:29 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
[7/2/20, 5:47:29 PM] Lore: Jajaj 🙈
[7/2/20, 5:47:35 PM] Joe: I’m just kidding
[7/2/20, 5:47:53 PM] Lore: Tu madre nos vería seguro jajaja
[7/2/20, 5:47:55 PM] Joe: That would be siiiick. Perfect place with the mix of spanish and english hahah
‎[7/2/20, 5:48:25 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 5:49:02 PM] Joe: For sure! She likes that show too much haha. It’s funny to watch it now that I’ve been talking to you for so long
[7/2/20, 5:49:52 PM] Joe: Sometimes I think what we’re doing is crazy...but then I see that show hahaha
[7/2/20, 5:49:54 PM] Lore: Jajaja pero como es el programa?
[7/2/20, 5:50:48 PM] Lore: Eso será actuado, como todos los programas de ese tipo, me cuesta creer que sean reales jajajaja
[7/2/20, 5:51:16 PM] Lore: Eso es muy americano, acá se dice "americanadas" 🙊😂
[7/2/20, 5:51:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh it’s a crazy show haha. The person will go to another country to meet someone they have never met. Then they have to get married in 90 days or the person would have to go back to their country
[7/2/20, 5:51:56 PM] Lore: Mierda jajaja
[7/2/20, 5:52:39 PM] Joe: Oh yeah definitely.
[7/2/20, 5:53:09 PM] Joe: But yeah, the show is wild. I’m sure much of it is staged but supposedly some of the people really get married
[7/2/20, 5:53:33 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 5:53:52 PM] Lore: Voy a ver luego algo de eso
[7/2/20, 5:56:01 PM] Joe: Haha oh that’ll be good. I’m looking forward to hearing your reaction.
[7/2/20, 5:56:59 PM] Joe: Damn I wonder what TV is like in other places now. Hopefully I’ll be finding out soon enough but I never really thought about the differences in TV around the world
[7/2/20, 5:59:59 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 6:00:07 PM] Lore: Tienen hijos y de todo
[7/2/20, 6:00:37 PM] Lore: Hay gente que parece "normal" y gente que es raaaara 😷
[7/2/20, 6:00:46 PM] Joe: Are you watching already?
[7/2/20, 6:00:53 PM] Lore: Una rubia con uñas super largas y un gordo
[7/2/20, 6:02:45 PM] Joe: Hahaha i haven’t seen a lot of the people but I didn’t like the ones that I saw very much
‎[7/2/20, 6:02:58 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/2/20, 6:03:30 PM] Lore: Jajaja estos pareja? No me lo creo Mohamed esta mucho mejor que ella
[7/2/20, 6:04:44 PM] Joe: Hahah you’re just going to judge all the people 😂 I wonder why they decide to go on the show. They must pay for a bunch of stuff or something. I don’t get it
‎[7/2/20, 6:05:00 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/2/20, 6:05:44 PM] Lore: Si lo siento, jajaja puedo hacer esta locura de verdad pero no salir en la TV
[7/2/20, 6:07:26 PM] Lore: Así que seguramente me burle de ello .. muchas veces lo hago pero al final termino mirando algo.. me pasó con Sandra que me burlé de un programa suyo, y como me quedaba a dormir en su casa antigua, tuve que ver obligada la final del programa jajaja y a las 3hs me sabía todos los nombres e historias
[7/2/20, 6:07:34 PM] Joe: You judging the people is entertaining to me 🤷‍♂️ I think it’s funny the things you notice or point out to me. But yeah, real life is ok, on tv though 😬
[7/2/20, 6:08:43 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that can happen. Even with phrases, you can start off saying something as a joke and eventually you’re really using the phrase haha
[7/2/20, 6:09:01 PM] Lore: jaja qué juzgo las cosas que te entretienen? 😬😬 Ups
[7/2/20, 6:09:18 PM] Joe: I’m going to watch La Casa De Papel over and over until I understand everyone 😂
[7/2/20, 6:10:29 PM] Joe: Haha like when you were judging those ladies with the annoying voices. I don’t know how to describe it but you seem like such a nice person that when I hear you talk like that it makes me laugh
[7/2/20, 6:11:30 PM] Lore: Yo me burlo mucho de todo.. jaja esa soy yo .. de gente bien no, solo de gente que me parece tonta cómo actúa o habla
[7/2/20, 6:12:05 PM] Joe: Perfect haha
[7/2/20, 6:12:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja amable? Jajaj soy una hija de puta
[7/2/20, 6:12:14 PM] Lore: No mentira,es broma jajaja soy buena persona
[7/2/20, 6:12:52 PM] Joe: Hahahah

[7/2/20, 6:13:05 PM] Joe: Mischievous
[7/2/20, 6:13:35 PM] Lore: Por suerte a Sandra le tocó ir al evento también
[7/2/20, 6:14:04 PM] Lore: Y pudo comprobar todo lo que yo decía de esas chicas y de un chico que se gay muy malo jajaja
[7/2/20, 6:15:02 PM] Lore: Hay una a la que no soportamos, le pusimos el apodo" la enana" jaja ella es muy bajita y tiene voz de pito.. además de que cuando solo dice tonterías jajaja
‎[7/2/20, 6:15:34 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[7/2/20, 6:15:48 PM] Lore: Sandra la grabó, para que Luchi pueda verla jajaj
[7/2/20, 6:16:57 PM] Joe: Hahaha 😂
[7/2/20, 6:17:09 PM] Joe: She had to share with a video haha
[7/2/20, 6:18:26 PM] Lore: Si, por su forma de vestir también jajaj jaja iba vestida con tantos modelos horribles cada día
[7/2/20, 6:21:32 PM] Joe: Hahaha yes her outfit is not very flattering on her
[7/2/20, 6:24:16 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/2/20, 6:24:27 PM] Lore: Ahora me siento juzgada por vos
[7/2/20, 6:25:24 PM] Lore: Vos tan correcto, sin criticar. Yo burlándome de los prometidos o de la enana 🤐
[7/2/20, 6:26:21 PM] Joe: Hahah if I ever judge you, the only conclusion I come to at the end is that you’re beautiful
[7/2/20, 6:27:00 PM] Joe: I enjoy it. Say whatever about whoever haha

[7/2/20, 6:32:18 PM] Joe: I try to keep the “corniness” to a minimum haha
[7/2/20, 6:33:07 PM] Joe: But then you know when you hear me being corny that I really like you and I’m willing to sound dumb for you haha
‎[7/2/20, 6:33:14 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 6:33:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn this gif makes me think about how little I talked at first every time you send it 😂

Well in case I don’t say anything like that for a while, I’ll say it now, I think you’re beautiful and funny and smart. I love your attitude towards life and the fun we have just spending hours talking through WhatsApp haha. I think you’re the best

[7/2/20, 6:43:27 PM] Lore: Gracias bombón! Pienso lo mismo!! Me gustas mucho y haberte conocido es genial, principalmente pq no me suelen gustar tanto los chicos para llegar al punto de estar atenta, cariñosa, etc.. que es al punto que llegué con vos a miles de km jaja
‎[7/2/20, 6:45:40 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 6:45:48 PM] Joe: Vos haha
[7/2/20, 6:46:46 PM] Joe: But I also don’t get to this point with many girls. You did excellent work at the remote job of getting my attention hahah
[7/2/20, 6:47:48 PM] Joe: I seriously have no interest in girls at the moment besides you. Shit, before you messaged me I was very content being alone 🤷‍♂️ but something about you won me over

[7/2/20, 6:52:25 PM] Lore: Me alegro que sea así, que no estés interesado en otras chicas y que te interese yo jajaja. Si te sirve para sumar a este nivel tan cursi jajaja el otro día me escribió otro de los chicos que me veía con el antes de la cuarentena y le tuve que decir que no jaja, la misma conversación que con el otro
‎[7/2/20, 6:52:55 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/2/20, 6:54:14 PM] Joe: Damn another one gets let down my Lore for me hahaa I feel special 😂
[7/2/20, 6:54:26 PM] Lore: Me sentía incómoda al explicarle a ellos lo que me había pasado durante la cuarentena jaja, pero bueno, así mejor ...
[7/2/20, 6:55:00 PM] Lore: Jajaja 🤷
[7/2/20, 6:55:26 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m sure that’s a strange conversation haha glad you handle it well
[7/2/20, 6:55:37 PM] Lore: Yo no quería explicarlo.. pero cuando me dijo de vernos y yo siempre decía no puedo jaja, ya tuve que decir la verdad
[7/2/20, 6:56:26 PM] Lore: El primero se enfadó mucho, de hecho intento burlarse de vos, sin conocerte, pero no funcionó jajaja
[7/2/20, 6:56:57 PM] Lore: Luego el otro, dijo que se alegraba por mi, pero siento que es un poco mentira jaja
[7/2/20, 6:57:08 PM] Lore: Mierda te cuento al final todo jajaja
[7/2/20, 6:57:30 PM] Joe: 😬
[7/2/20, 6:57:31 PM] Joe: Hahah
[7/2/20, 6:58:10 PM] Joe: Don’t worry you can tell me anything.
[7/2/20, 6:58:32 PM] Joe: I’m glad I haven’t had to have that conversation with anyone yet 🤣
[7/2/20, 6:59:34 PM] Lore: Yet... 😬
[7/2/20, 7:00:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha well I doubt that I would ever have that conversation
[7/2/20, 7:00:27 PM] Joe: But I would tell you if I did.
[7/2/20, 7:00:58 PM] Joe: I would tell you anything that you should know. I trust you and I hope you trust me too at this point to be honest with you.
[7/2/20, 7:01:43 PM] Lore: Jaja okey
[7/2/20, 7:03:42 PM] Lore: Si igual no te pido nada, no hace falta que vos tengas esas conversaciones.. yo si quería tenerlas, porque no quería ser hipócrita con ellos, ni forzarme a estar con quién no quiero. Simple
[7/2/20, 7:06:00 PM] Joe: Haha yeah pretty simple I guess
[7/2/20, 7:07:16 PM] Lore: 🤷🤷🤷 que seco

[7/2/20, 7:07:36 PM] Lore: Si lo sé no te digo nada 🙃
[7/2/20, 7:08:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what to say 😂 but I think you’re great for telling them the truth and even for talking to me about it too. It’s just a little honesty that I can appreciate
[7/2/20, 7:10:53 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno, igual todo biennn
[7/2/20, 7:11:28 PM] Lore: Eso sí, si cancelas el viaje en algún momento avísame jajaja
[7/2/20, 7:12:29 PM] Joe: Hahahah
[7/2/20, 7:12:40 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll let you know. But it’s not happening.
[7/2/20, 7:12:43 PM] Lore: Me voy a dormir, que Kenya me mira con los ojos de dormida jaja
[7/2/20, 7:12:48 PM] Joe: If you get tired of waiting, let me know haha
[7/2/20, 7:13:18 PM] Lore: Jaja okey!!
[7/2/20, 7:13:25 PM] Joe: Ok sleep well! I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches babe 😘
[7/2/20, 7:13:28 PM] Lore: No creo!
[7/2/20, 7:13:33 PM] Lore: Escucha
[7/2/20, 7:13:37 PM] Lore: Tu reunión?
[7/2/20, 7:15:40 PM] Joe: My meeting.m? With the guy? He never called!! He texted me at 2:15 asking if I was ready to get started, I texted back saying I was ready...and nothing
[7/2/20, 7:16:39 PM] Joe: Haha but me and you? We’re meeting babe. For sure. It’s happening. Anyway, get some sleep. Buenas nochesss
[7/2/20, 7:20:45 PM] Lore: Mmmm este chico no se está portando bien..
[7/2/20, 7:21:09 PM] Lore: No entiendo.. el te contacta y luego no responde.. me parece poco serio.. espero que puedas hablar mejor con el y que sólo este ocupado
[7/2/20, 7:21:41 PM] Joe: Yeah he is being weird but the product looks legit. I sent you a link. They have an iOS and Android app too.
[7/2/20, 7:22:06 PM] Joe: We’ll see what happens. I don’t understand either haha
[7/2/20, 7:22:26 PM] Lore: Mmmm
[7/2/20, 7:22:36 PM] Joe: I’ll contact him tomorrow since I’m off all day.
[7/2/20, 7:22:55 PM] Joe: But you get some sleep we’ll talk later
[7/2/20, 7:22:59 PM] Lore: Pero aún no te respondió
[7/2/20, 7:23:15 PM] Lore: A ese mensaje
[7/2/20, 7:23:16 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️ I’ll call him
[7/2/20, 7:23:39 PM] Lore: Si, mejor llama, no le escribas más mensajes por qué se olvida al parecer
[7/2/20, 7:24:22 PM] Joe: It’s always text or email that he has been unreliable. He can’t avoid me on the phone. But we just talked on the phone yesterday and it seemed like we were going to start today. Whatever.
[7/2/20, 7:25:01 PM] Lore: Si llama y deja las cosas claras con el
[7/2/20, 7:25:02 PM] Joe: I’ll figure it out
[7/2/20, 7:25:17 PM] Joe: Last chance for him haha
[7/2/20, 7:25:25 PM] Lore: Si está ocupado que lo diga, pero tu tiempo es importante
[7/2/20, 7:25:55 PM] Joe: It did give me more time to study up on what I need to know so that’s good but yeah, tomorrow is his last chance haha
[7/2/20, 7:26:46 PM] Lore: Bien, ánimo! Seguro pueden hablar bien y si no, no pasa nada!
[7/2/20, 7:26:58 PM] Lore: Ya me contarás qué pasa
[7/2/20, 7:27:19 PM] Lore: Kenya y yo te deseamos buenas noches! Muuak 😘

[7/2/20, 11:24:07 PM] Lore: Ohhhh 😍😍
[7/2/20, 11:25:16 PM] Lore: Jajajajaj muy bueno .. el segundo no lo veía y socks como una momia a tu lado 😂
[7/2/20, 11:30:42 PM] Joe: Aw I’m sorry babe. You’ll have to tell me about this nightmare sometime.
[7/2/20, 11:31:33 PM] Joe: Socks being a little weirdo haha
[7/2/20, 11:37:07 PM] Lore: Es del: te lo advierto. La pesadilla es que estaba viviendo en una casa.. 6° planta. Las ventanas estaban abiertas completamente, lola venía corriendo hacia mí y salía volando por la ventana, Kenya se frenaba y Lola caía al vacío.. Uf que horror, como lloraba en el sueño
[7/2/20, 11:37:41 PM] Lore: "Es feo: te lo advierto"
[7/2/20, 11:39:06 PM] Lore: La otra vez le tiraba una pelota y ella con la emoción no se daba cuenta de la ventana tampoco y la traspasaba
[7/2/20, 11:39:47 PM] Joe: Aww damn that sucks.
[7/2/20, 11:40:34 PM] Joe: Even worse if you throw the ball 😞 that’s a sad dream
[7/2/20, 11:41:12 PM] Lore: Sueño eso por miedo y un trauma que tuve de pequeña, un coche atropelló a mí perra y él se fue a la fuga. Nunca más quise tener perros
[7/2/20, 11:42:43 PM] Joe: Oooh that’s so sad! I’m sorry!
[7/2/20, 11:44:07 PM] Joe: Damn I was not expecting such sadness from the nightmare.
[7/2/20, 11:44:40 PM] Lore: Jaja
[7/2/20, 11:44:42 PM] Lore: Perdón
[7/2/20, 11:45:32 PM] Lore: Prefiero soñar con cucarachas o tarántulas que les tengo fobia antes que con esto
[7/2/20, 11:46:01 PM] Lore: Me levanté agitada como sin aire
[7/2/20, 11:46:30 PM] Lore: Pero vi el vídeo de los 4 perritos jjj 😊
[7/2/20, 11:48:23 PM] Joe: Haha well I hope the video made you feel a little better. And don’t worry I’m glad you shared with me I just didn’t expect it

[7/3/20, 12:27:20 AM] Lore: Jajaj si a ella le encanta. Yo duermo con ella como si fuese un humano

[7/3/20, 1:32:09 PM] Joe: I like your laugh. It’s infectious haha but yeah sleeping out there would be sick. Go camping or something. I’m sure that’s not allowed though.
[7/3/20, 1:32:22 PM] Joe: But the place you went looked awesome
[7/3/20, 1:35:01 PM] Lore: Jaja gracias lindo. No está permitido, pero si pernoctar, es decir, dormir sin tienda de campaña. Solo sobre de dormir. Si te pudiese trasladar ahora mismo te diría de hacerlo jaja
[7/3/20, 1:35:45 PM] Lore: Siiii, me encanta. Más que cualquier calle o edificio de madrid. Es tan especial la naturaleza, la luz , como cambia con las estaciones! Siempre tan linda
[7/3/20, 1:37:13 PM] Joe: Haha sobre de dormir
[7/3/20, 1:37:42 PM] Joe: Sobre sobres
[7/3/20, 1:39:08 PM] Joe: We’re totally going camping someday haha

[7/3/20, 1:43:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha my favorite word. I’m so good at saying it
[7/3/20, 1:44:29 PM] Lore: ImissyouImissyouImissyou
[7/3/20, 1:44:47 PM] Lore: 🤪🤪🤪
[7/3/20, 1:45:09 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/3/20, 1:45:40 PM] Joe: Haha that was unexpected from you but I like it 😆 I miss you too! I wish I was there to have fun with you on a day like today
[7/3/20, 1:46:55 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, soy un poco inesperada e impulsiva 😬
[7/3/20, 1:47:47 PM] Lore: Y encima cuando fumo o tomo unas cervezas más de la cuenta jaja siento las cosas "más fuerte"
[7/3/20, 1:47:54 PM] Lore: Quiero todo ya jaja jaja
[7/3/20, 1:50:56 PM] Joe: Hahah uh oh impulsive Lore is here after a couple of beers and smoking 😂
[7/3/20, 1:51:42 PM] Joe: You’re hilarious. I need to see you in person hahaha ugh stop being far away
[7/3/20, 1:51:58 PM] Joe: Oh, and that dude told me Monday now 🙄
[7/3/20, 1:54:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja si siempre un poco, creo que vos sos perfecto para mi balance jajajaj
[7/3/20, 1:55:28 PM] Lore: Contame, lo llamaste? Que te dijo?
‎[7/3/20, 1:57:01 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/3/20, 1:57:42 PM] Joe: Yeah he just said he got busy and that he would send me the non-disclosures and contract through email and we’ll start Monday 🤷‍♂️
[7/3/20, 1:57:56 PM] Joe: I’ll believe it when I get paid 😂
[7/3/20, 1:59:58 PM] Lore: Jaja es un poco arriesgado por su comportamiento, no fue muy serio. Pero bueno, tenés que intentarlo. Esta bien pagado y puede darte experiencia..así que no perdés demasiado, en todo caso, ganas. Así que ánimo rulitos,con contrato mejor así queda todo por escrito!
[7/3/20, 2:03:17 PM] Joe: Yeah and I’ll make sure to read the contact good haha
[7/3/20, 2:04:09 PM] Joe: If anything I’ll learn the technology and add it to my resume. Its use is super common for building apps so it’s a valuable skill
[7/3/20, 2:08:48 PM] Lore: Claro!!! Esa app es un buen proyecto seguramente. Además así ves como trabajan ellos. Ya trabajaste para alguna empresa en codificación o por tu cuenta siempre?
[7/3/20, 2:13:06 PM] Joe: Well I’ve worked for a company but it wasn’t as an employee. Similar to this project but not as big. Always contract work or consulting.
[7/3/20, 2:26:39 PM] Joe: I’m about to skate and film babe. But I’m glad you had a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😘
[7/3/20, 3:05:00 PM] Lore: Yo creo que es buena opción, dar una oportunidad para ver...el lunes se pondrán las cosas en su lugar
[7/3/20, 3:06:11 PM] Lore: Yihaaa, espero ver algo de eso, que te vaya súper bien patinando, tené cuidado! Yo en la cama con mi ventilador al lado, miraré una peli para dormirme jjj

[7/3/20, 11:09:15 PM] Joe: Getting ready to go to a waterfall or something with Kyle and his girlfriend tomorrow. I don’t know exactly, they made the plans and asked if I wanted to go. But we leave early so I’m staying here tonight.
[7/3/20, 11:09:22 PM] Joe: My turn for some nature haha
[7/3/20, 11:21:21 PM] Joe: Aaah we had to send the little dogs back to their own house 😞

[7/4/20, 7:11:58 AM] Lore: Gracias por el video de viaje guía preferido!
[7/4/20, 7:15:20 AM] Joe: The trip is 4 hours. We’re about halfway there now.

[7/4/20, 7:24:39 AM] Lore: Jaja cómo se llaman esas cataratas?
[7/4/20, 7:25:08 AM] Lore: Que sitios conoces de estados unidos?
[7/4/20, 7:30:31 AM] Joe: Mossbrea falls
[7/4/20, 7:32:14 AM] Joe: Like specific places? So many places to name haha
[7/4/20, 7:35:50 AM] Joe: But the United States is so big I’ve barely seen much even though I have a decent list I guess. I’ve been to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and New York. Still have a lot I haven’t seen
[7/4/20, 7:38:06 AM] Lore: Jaja sí por estados
[7/4/20, 7:38:23 AM] Lore: Y cuál te gustó más? Quitando Hawaii jaja
[7/4/20, 7:40:39 AM] Joe: I liked Washington the most but I only went in summer. I heard it is cloudy and rainy most of the year
[7/4/20, 7:41:57 AM] Joe: So I don’t know if I’d like it all year around. Texas was too hot, dry, and flat but at least it is relatively cheap to live there
[7/4/20, 7:43:25 AM] Joe: New York had too many people. I forgot I also went to New Jersey and Pennsylvania too, same trip as New York. East coast is very densely packed compared to when you go out west.
[7/4/20, 7:43:51 AM] Joe: Arizona was hot and a hella racist haha
[7/4/20, 7:45:35 AM] Joe: Oregon is cool. My brother lives there. Great for outdoor stuff. They get snow in the winter, summer and spring are pretty nice. I have to drive a couple of hours to the mountains for snow here.
[7/4/20, 7:46:50 AM] Lore: Buuuuu no queremos a Arizona
[7/4/20, 7:47:54 AM] Lore: El resto suena genial
[7/4/20, 7:49:16 AM] Lore: Aunque lo más lindo California no?
[7/4/20, 7:50:06 AM] Joe: Haha Texas is pretty racist too. The whole southern part of the states is kind of racist 😬
[7/4/20, 7:50:45 AM] Lore: 😷😷😷
[7/4/20, 7:50:53 AM] Joe: Oh yeah California is really nice. Ideal weather and have access to all kinds of cool places
[7/4/20, 7:51:41 AM] Lore: A la playa de San Onofre, fuiste?
[7/4/20, 7:54:34 AM] Joe: Haha no that’s like 8 hours away from me. I rarely go to Southern California
[7/4/20, 7:56:17 AM] Joe: Also, the water is cold at the beaches here. Not the most pleasant unless it’s super hot. Not like tropical waters at all haha
[7/4/20, 8:00:04 AM] Lore: Upsss
[7/4/20, 8:00:15 AM] Lore: Y La Jolla? Esta lejos de vos también?
[7/4/20, 8:00:28 AM] Lore: Ahí hay una construcción que me encanta
[7/4/20, 8:01:34 AM] Lore: 😬😬😬
[7/4/20, 8:06:05 AM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s far too. A lot beaches you think of are probably around San Diego
[7/4/20, 8:08:10 AM] Lore: https://www.instagram.com/p/BnR5uWrjDTN/?igshid=1upxonlc1ncdz
[7/4/20, 8:10:25 AM] Joe: That’s tight! Super far from me though haha. Almost at the California/Mexico border
[7/4/20, 8:15:13 AM] Lore: Jaja oh todo lejos

[7/4/20, 8:27:53 AM] Lore: Que lleva socks? Un chaleco rosa? 😅
[7/4/20, 8:30:04 AM] Joe: We took his other car. Automatic gears ⚙️
[7/4/20, 8:32:30 AM] Joe: Haha it’s her leash. We stopped recently to let the dogs out for a bit

[7/4/20, 8:37:58 AM] Lore: Ah jaja que raro debe ser conducir sin mover las marchas
[7/4/20, 8:38:28 AM] Lore: Oiiish jjj
[7/4/20, 8:43:33 AM] Joe: It’s rare to drive with moving the gears here haha. Super. Having manual gears is the best security for a car here cause people don’t know how to drive them, so they can’t steal them

[7/4/20, 12:06:30 PM] Joe: She only got in up to her legs. The dogs too

[7/5/20, 8:09:21 AM] Lore: Hola!
[7/5/20, 8:09:55 AM] Lore: Si una mosquitera necesito, es que me gusta dormir con la ventana abierta
[7/5/20, 8:19:52 AM] Joe: Oooh. There is no screen on your window?
[7/5/20, 8:20:46 AM] Joe: Yeah a net would be a good idea. But they’ll still get in your room so they might get you later haha
[7/5/20, 8:21:08 AM] Lore: Jaja no, a Sandra esta mañana me dijo que a ella también la habían picado . Tenemos que poner
[7/5/20, 8:21:12 AM] Lore: Somos un poco despistadas jaja
[7/5/20, 8:21:31 AM] Lore: Igual llevamos unos meses en esta casa, yo antes vivía en la sierra con otras chicas
[7/5/20, 8:23:06 AM] Joe: Before the loss of Romancito 😞 haha
[7/5/20, 8:24:05 AM] Lore: Ayer por la noche justo íbamos a cenar, yo puse una lavadora, me fui a duchar y cuando volví estaba todo lleno de agua jaja no tenemos idea de eso jaja

‎[7/5/20, 8:30:48 AM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/5/20, 8:32:06 AM] Joe: I haven’t thought about it. I like the first song, Paseo and obviously the Los Delinquentes songs haha
[7/5/20, 8:32:16 AM] Joe: Volar
[7/5/20, 8:33:08 AM] Joe: I don’t know, I guess i like all the songs but which I like most depends on my mood haha
[7/5/20, 8:35:28 AM] Lore: Macaco es romántico en ese tema
[7/5/20, 8:36:34 AM] Lore: Paseo? Jaja Estopa es un clásico de España, ese grupo lleva muchos años
[7/5/20, 8:36:50 AM] Lore: 👏
[7/5/20, 8:37:21 AM] Lore: Voy a ponerte alguna canción más por si te apetece escuchar algún día
[7/5/20, 8:42:05 AM] Joe: Oh yeah add as many as you can haha. I’ll definitely listen
[7/5/20, 8:47:12 AM] Joe: Damn you’re already doing it haha adding a bunch of stuff I see. Thanks babe!

[7/5/20, 8:47:34 AM] Joe: The playlist went from 1 hour to 2 hours haha
[7/5/20, 8:48:16 AM] Lore: Esta me trae muy buenos recuerdos, con amigos íbamos a sus conciertos y yo me metía en el "pogo" a saltar me encantaba jajaja justo en el estribillo
[7/5/20, 8:49:17 AM] Lore: Este grupo es Uruguayo y venían a España, y era genial sus conciertos eran super especiales, cantábamos y saltabamos mucho jaja

[7/5/20, 8:50:15 AM] Lore: Jaja sí iba en el metro y aproveché para agregarte más cositas jjj
[7/5/20, 8:50:26 AM] Joe: Hahaha I can imagine a concert of this band being fun. Good energy to dance and jump around to. Get everyone hyped up
[7/5/20, 8:51:12 AM] Joe: This song sounds like it would be in a montage of a movie. Like a super epic part that’s all feel good and shit 😂
[7/5/20, 8:51:15 AM] Lore: Jaja sí me gusta ir a conciertos
[7/5/20, 8:51:45 AM] Lore: Me acuerdo al primero que fui con un amigo, era de los red hot .. muuuucha gente.. yo caí en el pogo y me tuvieron que levantar del suelo jajsja
[7/5/20, 8:54:53 AM] Joe: Hahah damn that’s wild. I haven’t gone to too many concerts but they’re fun. I like the outdoor festivals with concerts haha. Those are fun
[7/5/20, 9:01:03 AM] Lore: Sii esos son mejores
[7/5/20, 9:01:41 AM] Lore: Yo quería ir con mis amigas a uno que hay de reggae en verano pero suspendido x corona

[7/5/20, 9:04:52 AM] Joe: It was getting all tangled though
[7/5/20, 9:05:37 AM] Joe: Ohhh yeah I wonder when they’ll allow all that stuff again. Probably phase 3 but who knows when that comes

[7/5/20, 9:29:19 AM] Joe: Hahaha have to show you what I look like at my worst 😂
[7/5/20, 9:30:11 AM] Joe: I thought it was funny so I had to send it to you. It was so big.
[7/5/20, 9:30:47 AM] Joe: I combed all the curls out haha. You probably didn’t like that look very much 🥴
[7/5/20, 9:31:11 AM] Lore: Jajajaj si es gracioso
[7/5/20, 9:31:19 AM] Lore: Pero no me encanta ese look de homeless
[7/5/20, 9:31:25 AM] Lore: Jajaja

[7/5/20, 9:31:38 AM] Joe: That’s totally fine with me haha
[7/5/20, 9:31:44 AM] Lore: Después de ver que volvieron los rizos
[7/5/20, 9:31:58 AM] Lore: *Los rulos
[7/5/20, 9:32:31 AM] Joe: Hahaha didn’t mean to scare you 😱
[7/5/20, 9:32:54 AM] Joe: But at least the curls came back quick haha
[7/5/20, 9:34:19 AM] Lore: Jajajaja 😬
[7/5/20, 9:34:45 AM] Joe: To be honest though me curls aren’t as awesome as they are in Hawaii. My hair like it there 😂
[7/5/20, 9:35:00 AM] Joe: All the salt water in the air
[7/5/20, 9:35:15 AM] Joe: And the humidity
[7/5/20, 9:36:07 AM] Lore: Jajaj si tenías unos rulos hermosos en Hawaii, tengo un vídeo de un rulos tirabuzón jajaj aunque ahora no te veo mucho siempre vas con coleta 😔
[7/5/20, 9:40:05 AM] Joe: Haha I’ll let my hair down for you more
[7/5/20, 9:45:10 AM] Lore: 😁😚
[7/5/20, 9:52:22 AM] Joe: The screen on my phone is slowly dying 😱
[7/5/20, 9:52:43 AM] Joe: I need to go get a new one or get this fixed as soon as possible before it goes out on me
[7/5/20, 9:53:33 AM] Lore: Y eso? Se te cayó o algo?
[7/5/20, 9:54:48 AM] Joe: I always drop it but it just started happening randomly a week or two ago. Very slightly. But now it’s getting worse
[7/5/20, 9:56:36 AM] Lore: Será que la usas mucho últimamente jajajaja
[7/5/20, 10:08:38 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I guess so 🤷‍♂️ hopefully it doesn’t break for a little while longer. Just need a few more weeks
[7/5/20, 10:24:11 AM] Lore: si desapareces unos días, ya sé por qué será jajaj
[7/5/20, 10:35:33 AM] Joe: Haha i would just talk to you from the computer 😂

[7/5/20, 10:37:19 AM] Lore: jajajajaja
[7/5/20, 11:38:36 AM] Joe: I think the song you sent a link to is my new favorite from the playlist haha
[7/5/20, 11:46:31 AM] Lore: Jaja nahh, hay varias. La elegiste pq sabes que me gusta 😜
[7/5/20, 11:56:00 AM] Joe: Mmm nah but alright hahaha
[7/5/20, 11:56:41 AM] Joe: I haven’t heard all the ones you added yet though. I don’t have premium so they play in a random order haha

[7/5/20, 12:36:18 PM] Lore: Escucha el motor 😁
[7/5/20, 12:40:13 PM] Joe: Hahah I just meant it’s my favorite of the playlist I’ve heard so far. Like, I like it more than the list of favorites I gave you earlier
[7/5/20, 12:40:47 PM] Joe: I’ll make sure he takes a video if we ever get this thing done haha
[7/5/20, 12:41:23 PM] Lore: Más que los delincuentes? Jaja
[7/5/20, 12:41:31 PM] Lore: Yo ahora la estoy bailando mientras limpio

[7/5/20, 1:11:40 PM] Joe: Hahah thaaanks. I’m alright I guess
[7/5/20, 1:13:03 PM] Joe: You’re sweet.
[7/5/20, 1:13:25 PM] Joe: Alright I have to drive to pick up this food now
[7/5/20, 1:33:18 PM] Lore: Repetí la misma palabra sin darme cuenya jaja tengo que mirar antes de enviar  jaja
[7/5/20, 1:33:51 PM] Lore: Yihaaaaa jaja
[7/5/20, 2:14:51 PM] Joe: Hahah I was actually wondering about that. Confused me for a second
[7/5/20, 2:15:15 PM] Joe: Fixing this car is taking forever haha I want to drive it!
[7/5/20, 2:19:40 PM] Lore: Tonta yo, jaja no me di cuenta. Sorry
[7/5/20, 2:20:16 PM] Lore: Jaja vos estás arreglándolo también? Se te da bien la mecánica?
[7/5/20, 2:44:02 PM] Joe: I’m alright at fixing stuff but not great at diagnosing the problem. Once I know what it is and how to fix it I can usually do the work
[7/5/20, 3:22:59 PM] Lore: Muy bien, así me gusta. Jaja
[7/5/20, 3:43:40 PM] Lore: Bueno, me voy a dormirr que estoy cansadita ya! Que pases una buena tardee y nochee! Muak 😘
[7/5/20, 11:04:18 PM] Joe: Buenos días babe! I’m super tired. I never even got to drive the car today 😡 he was having all kinds of problems getting this thing done haha.
[7/5/20, 11:05:28 PM] Joe: But I’m going to bed now because I have to wake us early tomorrow. Enjoy your morning and afternoon! I’ll talk to you later 😘
[7/6/20, 12:39:29 AM] Lore: Hola, esta noche no me pico ni un solo mosquito jaja! asi que dormí muy bien y con el ventilador toda la noche. Que ganas de estar en la playa. Que pena que no pudiste conducir, bueno algun día de esta semana!
[7/6/20, 12:45:04 AM] Lore: Yo esta semana ya empiezo a trabajar de tarde, asi que igual cuando te despiertes, seguramente este en el trabajo! Que tengas buen día con los niños en el skatepark y la reunión con el chico de codificación! Muak 😘

[7/6/20, 6:44:21 AM] Joe: I signed the non-disclosure for that other job then never received the actual contract. The dude is starting to really annoy me haha
[7/6/20, 6:44:39 AM] Joe: Anyways, I hope you’re having a good day at work. Time for my morning coffee ☕️

[7/6/20, 6:50:15 AM] Lore: Recuérdale que está pendiente ese contrato y la hora de hoy. Así no hay malentendido 💪
[7/6/20, 6:51:34 AM] Lore: Gracias, si me escribiste justo 10 min antes de que entre a trabajar ☺️
[7/6/20, 6:52:38 AM] Joe: We didn’t set anything up for today. Last time I talked to him he said he would send all the contacts and stuff 🤷‍♂️
[7/6/20, 6:52:46 AM] Joe: Good idea
[7/6/20, 6:53:36 AM] Lore: Okey bombón si algo falla que no sea por vos, vos intenta hacer contacto para cerrar ese contrato y ganar ese dinero
[7/6/20, 6:53:45 AM] Joe: Haha good. I got a super short morning conversation with you just in time 😂
[7/6/20, 6:53:51 AM] Lore: Si el ves que no responde, ya te olvidas. Pero por lo menos sabes que fue por su culpa no suya
[7/6/20, 6:54:44 AM] Joe: You’re very right. Thanks for the advice babe I appreciate it
[7/6/20, 6:55:23 AM] Lore: Por su culpa, no tuya!!( Puto traductor)
[7/6/20, 6:55:53 AM] Joe: Hah I know what you meant

[7/6/20, 6:58:51 AM] Joe: Ok babe sounds good. Have a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😊 😘
[7/6/20, 12:07:40 PM] Lore: Vino una señora a tienda hoy, que no quería pagar envíos ni esperar y le expliqué las mejores opciones pero ella  no razonaba lo que le decía, super tacaña y maleducada

[7/6/20, 12:48:46 PM] Joe: Aaaah damn that sucks. I hate people like that. Need it their way even if that isn’t an option haha. Idiots.
[7/6/20, 12:50:07 PM] Joe: *buttons 

That’s terrible. I’m sorry to hear that you had to deal with such a rude person today.
[7/6/20, 12:50:20 PM] Joe: Customers are the worst sometimes
[7/6/20, 2:13:51 PM] Lore: Hola, ya estoyyyyy
[7/6/20, 2:16:04 PM] Lore: Si jaja no era contra mi, pero su manera de interactuar era fatal jaja y mi paciencia se agotó. Sobre todo es cuando querés ayudar a alguien, pero esa persona no razona.. y no dice gracias, es como.. de verdad?
[7/6/20, 2:16:19 PM] Lore: Pero bueno, ella era así .. seguramente nadie la aguanté a su alrededor jaja
[7/6/20, 2:17:59 PM] Lore: Igual por suerte es una mínima parte, antes atendí a otra que era super amable de hecho hablamos de la colonia que llevaba puesta, olía súper bien la señora jaja se sintió que me estaba haciendo un piropo cuando se lo pregunté ... Me contó que se había duchado y se pensaba que ya no olía jajaja
[7/6/20, 2:20:07 PM] Lore: Se sintió que LE estaba haciendo un piropo ( otra vez el traductor) jaja escribo rápido y se escribe solo
[7/6/20, 2:22:10 PM] Joe: That's good. It sounds like for the most part the people are alright haha.
[7/6/20, 2:22:48 PM] Joe: I used to work at a few pharmacies, customers were always in a bad mood 😬
[7/6/20, 2:23:49 PM] Joe: That dude didn't answer my call. I think i'm over working with this guy 🤬
[7/6/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: I was really looking forward to working on a mobile app but i don't know what to do at this point. So frustrating. What a waste of time
[7/6/20, 2:25:13 PM] Lore: Cuánto tiempo trabajaste en farmacias? Entonces estudiaste eso? Ibas con bata? Jaja gracioso.. jaja te sabes todos esos nombres raros entonces
‎[7/6/20, 2:26:06 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/6/20, 2:26:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah i had to memorize all the drug names. I worked in pharmacy for like 5 years, i had to do a little school but not much. I wasn't the pharmacist, i was a pharmacy technician, which is like the assistant. Not a fun job hahah
[7/6/20, 2:27:01 PM] Lore: No entiendo por qué es tan poco serio, creo que ya no tenés que hacer más. Lo intentaste y el no valora tu tiempo... Eso puede significar que cuando trabajes con el no sea serio o no te pague o cosas raras
[7/6/20, 2:27:05 PM] Joe: hahhahaa
[7/6/20, 2:27:18 PM] Lore: Si realmente esta interesado, te llamará.
[7/6/20, 2:27:45 PM] Joe: That's what i was worried about. Especially when he sent the NDA but not the contract for the work.
[7/6/20, 2:27:46 PM] Lore: Wow 5 años! Jajaja
[7/6/20, 2:28:02 PM] Joe: I still haven't received a contract so yeah, i'm over it haha
[7/6/20, 2:28:05 PM] Lore: Okey cuando me duela algo te preguntaré jajaja
[7/6/20, 2:28:24 PM] Joe: True
[7/6/20, 2:29:03 PM] Lore: Yo creo que ya hiciste todo lo que podías hacer, estuviste pendiente de ello, etc y el últimamente no esta portándose bien
[7/6/20, 2:29:59 PM] Joe: Part of my job was to literally not answer questions like that, by law i had to get the pharmacist to recommend medication. I will tell you what i think would help if you ask me hahaha but at work i had to get a pharmacist even if i knew the answer
[7/6/20, 2:30:19 PM] Lore: A lo mejor en unos días te envía el contrato, pero mientras tanto, hacé tus planes y tus cosas, tu tiempo es tuyo! Y si no te está pagando aún.. tenés que hacer cosas que te hagan bien.... no esperarlo durante horas a que el diga algo
[7/6/20, 2:31:04 PM] Lore: Jajaja pero la sabes la respuesta. A mí me da igual que seas farmacéutico o no 😂
[7/6/20, 2:31:36 PM] Joe: Yeah i already wasted a bunch of time waiting for him.
[7/6/20, 2:31:56 PM] Lore: Pero no te desanimes vale?
[7/6/20, 2:31:57 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah for you i will answer
[7/6/20, 2:32:09 PM] Joe: Never
[7/6/20, 2:32:10 PM] Lore: El no es serio, ni profesional...
[7/6/20, 2:33:18 PM] Joe: Yeah i'm not too worried about it. I'm just going to keep working on what i can for now. My boss actually said he has a coding job he needs done for his other skate camp haha.

[7/6/20, 2:36:57 PM] Joe: ugh
[7/6/20, 2:36:59 PM] Joe: whack
[7/6/20, 2:37:17 PM] Joe: I did want to get paid though haha
[7/6/20, 2:38:00 PM] Lore: Bueno, entusiasmate cuando ellos contacten con vos y eso ya pasó pq les interesas.. luego si sale el trabajo genial. Son posibilidades.. si no sale bueno, ya llegarán otros
[7/6/20, 2:38:41 PM] Joe: Yeaaaaah. Whatever it's cool
[7/6/20, 2:38:44 PM] Lore: Normal... Jaja yo también quiero estudiar codificación si pagan eso jajaj

[7/6/20, 2:40:45 PM] Lore: Claro... Jaja yo quiero ganar como en bahía y vivir como en España 😅
[7/6/20, 2:40:50 PM] Joe: They are paying for the time it took me to learn everything 😂😂
[7/6/20, 2:41:17 PM] Lore: Obvio!
[7/6/20, 2:42:06 PM] Joe: Graphic designer, user interface designer, user experience designer all get very high pay too and can be remote
[7/6/20, 2:42:14 PM] Joe: You would be good at those jobs
[7/6/20, 2:43:34 PM] Joe: I really want to see how well you could design websites if you learned how to use the right tools and spent a tiny amount of time studying it. You already have a good eye which is hard to teach
[7/6/20, 2:44:29 PM] Lore: Jajaj mmm
[7/6/20, 2:44:40 PM] Joe: My designs suuuuuck!
‎[7/6/20, 2:44:45 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/6/20, 2:45:08 PM] Lore: Nunca lo había pensado lo de las webs etc, pero me parece interesante, me di cuenta con vos cuando me contaste alguna cosa
[7/6/20, 2:45:26 PM] Lore: O viendo lo de tu juego, probando con Photoshop jaja
[7/6/20, 2:45:45 PM] Lore: Ohhhhh hace mucho que no jugamos jaja nostalgia
[7/6/20, 2:45:59 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[7/6/20, 2:46:09 PM] Joe: Damn you're right we haven't played in a while
[7/6/20, 2:46:17 PM] Lore: Me gusta el diseño gráfico y el diseño web creo que me gustaría también
[7/6/20, 2:46:37 PM] Lore: Pero todo es tan complicado que necesitaría tiempo jaja
[7/6/20, 2:46:49 PM] Lore: El maldito curso de 3D aún lo tengo
[7/6/20, 2:47:00 PM] Joe: I think you would like it too. The way you would send me revisions to my designs, it seemed like you were enjoying it.
[7/6/20, 2:47:26 PM] Lore: Si bastante jajaj
[7/6/20, 2:47:31 PM] Lore: No paraba de hacerte cambios
[7/6/20, 2:47:43 PM] Lore: Jajaja pensarías, esta chica esta loca
[7/6/20, 2:47:56 PM] Lore: Me escribe sin conocerme y me cambia el diseño de mi juego
[7/6/20, 2:48:00 PM] Joe: I'm sure the 3D course can be tied into web design. You can make 3D assets for websites i bet hahah all kinds of crazy stuff needed on websites now
[7/6/20, 2:49:32 PM] Joe: It was honestly one of the things that made me like you a lot more haha. I could just feel your passion about trying to make it look nice. You weren't being paid, you didn't have to do it, but you wanted to and you tried to do a good job regardless. I appreciated that a lot.
‎[7/6/20, 2:49:51 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/6/20, 2:50:35 PM] Lore: Jaja ohhh me vas a hacer  emocionar Joe jajajaj
[7/6/20, 2:51:25 PM] Joe: https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/adding-3d-models-to-your-website-d374a8cbbadd
[7/6/20, 2:51:26 PM] Lore: Si realmente lo hice por vos, te veía tan ilusionado con ese juego que quería ayudar. Y disfruté con ello, cada vez que entraba veía algún cambio y el tiempo que te llevaba en hacerlo y lo valoraba más jaja
[7/6/20, 2:51:37 PM] Joe: the article makes it seem not that hard haha
[7/6/20, 2:52:02 PM] Joe: Give me 3D model files of like a small object and i might be able to figure it out hahah
[7/6/20, 2:52:47 PM] Joe: But what i was saying was you could just do the 3D modeling part as a part of a team. You'd send the file of the 3D model to the programmer to insert into the website
[7/6/20, 2:53:34 PM] Lore: Mmm
[7/6/20, 2:53:58 PM] Lore: Pero como es eso, una web con 3d, decime algún ejemplo de alguna
[7/6/20, 2:54:43 PM] Joe: I'm trying to find an example haha
‎[7/6/20, 2:55:32 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 2:56:07 PM] Joe: Yes
[7/6/20, 2:56:29 PM] Joe: Have you ever been to a website that lets you rotate a 3D image to look at all sides of it?
[7/6/20, 2:56:46 PM] Joe: You would be the one to make that 3D model
[7/6/20, 2:56:58 PM] Joe: I can't find an example right now
[7/6/20, 2:57:01 PM] Lore: Ah sí
[7/6/20, 2:57:07 PM] Lore: Jajaja no yo no quiero hacer eso
‎[7/6/20, 2:57:17 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/6/20, 2:57:28 PM] Lore: No me gusta demasiado modelar por mucho rato jajaj
[7/6/20, 2:58:04 PM] Joe: Yeah it seems frustrating. Probably why it pays well hah
[7/6/20, 2:58:48 PM] Joe: Well if you are ever desperate for a job that uses your new 3D modeling skills, look into it
[7/6/20, 2:59:32 PM] Joe: They can be short jobs to pad the resume haha. But i would support whatever you do 🤷‍♂️
[7/6/20, 2:59:35 PM] Lore: Parece que puede gustarme, pero no especialmente.. jaja me agobio cuando la geometría no sale correcta. El ejercicio de me hace largo, sin embargo.. cuando maqueto paneles disfruto.. por ejemplo tipografías, colores, formas, organización de paneles, delinear planos también.. el 3d un rato.. me gusta más la parte de materiales, que la geometría en si jaja
[7/6/20, 3:00:40 PM] Lore: * se me hace largo
[7/6/20, 3:00:42 PM] Joe: Aaah ok ok. You still need to send me more of your work so i can see it haha
[7/6/20, 3:01:01 PM] Lore: Jaja es que no hice mucho más
[7/6/20, 3:01:22 PM] Lore: Tengo que ponerme más tiempo pero con el trabajo me cuesta concentrarme el tiempo que estoy libre
[7/6/20, 3:01:48 PM] Lore: Antes podía dedicar tiempo, ahora me cuesta, pero lo tengo en la cabeza todo el rato
[7/6/20, 3:01:48 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that's true. Back to real life haha
[7/6/20, 3:02:11 PM] Joe: That's cool you started it during quarantine though
[7/6/20, 3:02:31 PM] Lore: la vida real no me deja hablar con vos bien, ni jugar a los dados, ni hacer el curso 3d jajaja
[7/6/20, 3:02:57 PM] Joe: I'm sure you'll get it eventually. It'll just be a little slower than before
[7/6/20, 3:03:07 PM] Lore: Un poco antes la verdad, pero durante la cuarentena hubo una evolución considerable
[7/6/20, 3:03:12 PM] Joe: Let me know when you're ready for dice and we will play again hahah
[7/6/20, 3:03:50 PM] Joe: Maybe when it's not so late there
[7/6/20, 3:04:23 PM] Lore: Gracias, intentaré hacerlo si.. estoy motivada por acabarlo entonces me pongo presión para sacar tiempo pero tengo que estar concentrada, no cansada jaja
‎[7/6/20, 3:05:25 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:05:26 PM] Joe: Definitely. I understand. I work best in the morning time so having to work camp in the morning makes it harder for me to do well with my programming.
[7/6/20, 3:06:08 PM] Joe: Oh we can play haha i just thought it was late there and you might want to go to sleep
[7/6/20, 3:06:31 PM] Joe: Or maybe not go to sleep yet, but not get kept up late by my dumb game 😂
[7/6/20, 3:06:46 PM] Lore: Jaja no tengo sueño todavía
[7/6/20, 3:06:51 PM] Lore: Es pronto y mañana no madrugo
[7/6/20, 3:07:06 PM] Lore: Nunca me acuesto a esta hora cuando trabajo por la tarde
[7/6/20, 3:07:35 PM] Joe: haha then let's play 😈
‎[7/6/20, 3:08:46 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:08:52 PM] Lore: 🤔
[7/6/20, 3:09:07 PM] Joe: Haha what's the room name?
[7/6/20, 3:09:30 PM] Lore: Jaja el 5 debería estar en la misma línea 🙄
[7/6/20, 3:09:50 PM] Joe: Hahahahah dammit
[7/6/20, 3:10:12 PM] Joe: Oh i know the name. You're on mobile though so it was probably a capital "O"
‎[7/6/20, 3:10:21 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:11:19 PM] Lore: Sabes que si al final voy a jugar intentaré sacar algo jajaja 🙊
[7/6/20, 3:11:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha
[7/6/20, 3:11:43 PM] Joe: It's ok. You are right in the end
[7/6/20, 3:12:11 PM] Joe: Aaah you got disconnected. My game still sucks. Sweet
‎[7/6/20, 3:12:25 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:12:45 PM] Lore: No!!!
[7/6/20, 3:13:44 PM] Joe: Ok i made it. Lower case "o"
[7/6/20, 3:14:10 PM] Lore: Cómo?
[7/6/20, 3:14:21 PM] Lore: Es oso con minúsculas?
[7/6/20, 3:14:32 PM] Joe: Siii
[7/6/20, 3:14:43 PM] Lore: Antes funcionaba cuando ponía "Oso" desde el ordenador
[7/6/20, 3:15:02 PM] Lore: Okey voy
[7/6/20, 3:15:28 PM] Lore: Ah ya se pq no funcionaba
[7/6/20, 3:15:37 PM] Lore: Le daba al espacio
[7/6/20, 3:15:53 PM] Lore: Osea quedaba un espacio después de la letra, sabes?
[7/6/20, 3:16:03 PM] Lore: El cursor digo jaja
[7/6/20, 3:16:08 PM] Joe: Oh haha yeah mobile is weird when entering the name of stuff for some reason
[7/6/20, 3:28:39 PM] Joe: I did too well hahah sorry 😬 I'll fix those dice on mobile, put them all in a row. Thanks for the tip!
[7/6/20, 3:28:48 PM] Lore: Los dados en la misma línea
[7/6/20, 3:29:03 PM] Lore: Y otra cosa pq tiene un sombreado en dado? El cuadrado sale como un fondo gris
[7/6/20, 3:29:35 PM] Lore: Jaja no escribimos a la vez
[7/6/20, 3:29:40 PM] Lore: *Nos
[7/6/20, 3:29:55 PM] Joe: Hmmm interesting. Maybe there is a border on the dice or something? I'll try to fix that
[7/6/20, 3:30:19 PM] Lore: Si sale gris
‎[7/6/20, 3:30:41 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:31:31 PM] Joe: Oooooh yup that's probably a border or shadow setting. So it should just be flat looking dice right? No shadow or border would be better?
[7/6/20, 3:32:45 PM] Lore: Claro sin borde, es que no se entiende que es la sombra
[7/6/20, 3:33:23 PM] Lore: Puede ser el borde negro así con el detalle en las esquinas redondeado y ya está
[7/6/20, 3:33:40 PM] Lore: Venga va .. una última partida
[7/6/20, 3:33:41 PM] Lore: Jaja
[7/6/20, 3:34:18 PM] Joe: You got disconnected from my room haha
[7/6/20, 3:34:22 PM] Lore: Este es el único juego al que juego. Nunca jugué a nada de estas cosas, solo de pequeña
[7/6/20, 3:34:31 PM] Lore: No.. si yo estoy ahí
[7/6/20, 3:34:32 PM] Joe: A while ago. That happens on mobile when you close the browser sometimes
[7/6/20, 3:35:28 PM] Joe: Nooooo totally disconnected. I know it doesn't look like it but that is only because my game sucks hahah
[7/6/20, 3:35:29 PM] Lore: No lo cerré, le di a minimizar para responder un mensaje
[7/6/20, 3:35:37 PM] Lore: Esperaaaa
[7/6/20, 3:35:47 PM] Lore: Jajaj no te desesperes rulitos, voy a entrar
[7/6/20, 3:36:01 PM] Joe: hahah ok i wait
[7/6/20, 3:45:57 PM] Joe: Aaah disconnected.
[7/6/20, 3:46:01 PM] Joe: Was fun though hahah
‎[7/6/20, 3:46:04 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/6/20, 3:46:16 PM] Lore: Te iba a responder y pasó esto
[7/6/20, 3:46:41 PM] Joe: Oh your phone tried to reload the website i think
[7/6/20, 3:47:19 PM] Joe: I still haven't figured out how to fix that. Something to do with mobile. It never happens on computer. Or at least i haven't experienced it on a computer
[7/6/20, 3:47:47 PM] Lore: Exacto
[7/6/20, 3:47:57 PM] Lore: En la compu nunca hay error de este tipo
[7/6/20, 3:48:14 PM] Joe: I should make an actual app for use on mobile phones. That way i can teach myself that technology i was supposed to be using and hopefully fix some of these weird issues that happen with mobile browsers

[7/6/20, 4:14:59 PM] Joe: Me? Trying to decide what to eat haha. I'm hella hungry right now
[7/6/20, 4:15:54 PM] Lore: Jaja
[7/6/20, 4:16:05 PM] Joe: I should probably start looking for more remote work now too since this guy is not coming through
[7/6/20, 4:16:15 PM] Joe: After food haha
[7/6/20, 4:16:31 PM] Lore: Claro!
[7/6/20, 4:16:38 PM] Lore: Aprovecha
[7/6/20, 4:17:54 PM] Joe: Hopefully i find something soon. I like coding work haha
[7/6/20, 4:17:58 PM] Joe: What are you doing?
[7/6/20, 4:18:58 PM] Lore: Seguro que encontrás, cualquier cosa te sirve
[7/6/20, 4:19:48 PM] Lore: Yo en la cama, estaba poniéndome citronella para que no me pique los mosquitos, pero el olor no me gusta.. es muy fuerte
[7/6/20, 4:20:48 PM] Lore: Y ya me voy a dormir, así que nadaa... Buenas noches👋
[7/6/20, 4:21:15 PM] Joe: Hahah dammit
[7/6/20, 4:21:31 PM] Joe: Ok babe sleep well. I'll talk to you later. Buenas noches

[7/7/20, 12:10:11 PM] Joe: Just leaving work now! I’m freeee! Haha
[7/7/20, 12:10:14 PM] Joe: Such a short shift
[7/7/20, 12:10:43 PM] Lore: Yo también, no puedo creer que coincidamos en un horario jajaja
[7/7/20, 12:13:14 PM] Joe: Haha the schedule actually works out for once
[7/7/20, 12:13:42 PM] Joe: It was so hot at the park today. I was dying. How was your day?
[7/7/20, 12:14:18 PM] Lore: Jaja sí yo hoy pasé muchísimo calor también!
[7/7/20, 12:14:55 PM] Lore: Mi día bien.. trabajé por la tarde, y por la mañana hice cosas en casa y me fui a depilar por primera vez con láser
[7/7/20, 12:15:59 PM] Lore: Dios Joe que mal lo pasé, un dolor!!!! Lo aguanté pero tenía toda la cara llena de lágrimas jaja lloré de dolor
[7/7/20, 12:18:00 PM] Joe: Ooooh shit 😬
[7/7/20, 12:19:06 PM] Joe: Yeah it sounds painful haha. I can’t imagine
‎[7/7/20, 12:20:05 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/7/20, 12:20:49 PM] Lore: Es como si te apagan un cigarrillo en la piel, pero con un dolor muy punzante
[7/7/20, 12:21:47 PM] Lore: Ingles completas( pussy, chichi, concha.. por si te interesa saberlo) y axilas
[7/7/20, 12:23:26 PM] Joe: Oh what?? That sounds terrible! People do such strange things sometimes haha
[7/7/20, 12:23:52 PM] Joe: Hahah niiiice 👍 😂
[7/7/20, 12:24:39 PM] Joe: I cannot imagine lasering my dick hahaha
[7/7/20, 12:24:53 PM] Joe: Fuck that would suck so bad
[7/7/20, 12:28:32 PM] Lore: Jajaja si lo hago es para no depilarme nunca más jaja pero el próximo día voy con anestesia sin duda. Intenté ponerme música mientras la chica me lo hacía  . De hecho salió una de las canciones que me habías mandado vos, y ni por esas deje de pasarlo mal jajaj
[7/7/20, 12:29:21 PM] Lore: Jaja en realidad lo decís por si querés saber las palabras como se dice jaja no para que lo sepas... Pero tendrás que espabilar amigo ...
[7/7/20, 12:30:11 PM] Lore: Con niice 👍..  no
[7/7/20, 12:31:04 PM] Lore: 🤷
[7/7/20, 12:34:25 PM] Joe: Damn it’s so bad you need anesthetic the next day!? What the hell Lore! Why would you do that? hahahah
[7/7/20, 12:36:56 PM] Joe: I actually just learned concha the other day on Instagram haha. So random
[7/7/20, 12:40:10 PM] Joe: No wait....it was “chocho” I learned. Damn there is a lot of ways to say it haha
[7/7/20, 12:44:02 PM] Lore: Jaja sí, digo que no seas el nene de la pelota... niiice 🥱
[7/7/20, 12:44:18 PM] Lore: Jajaj se puede saber cómo lo aprendiste?
[7/7/20, 12:45:23 PM] Lore: Concha (uru-arg) Chocho/chichi/ (Esp)
‎[7/7/20, 12:47:06 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/7/20, 12:47:30 PM] Joe: Haha I sent you the post on Instagram where I learned it chocho.
[7/7/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: Aaah ok. Noted. So I’m guessing you would use the word concha most out of all the options??
[7/7/20, 12:51:29 PM] Lore: Jajaj no puedo creer que estés aprendiendo eso con los memes jaja bueno a ver si lo podés usar algún día
[7/7/20, 12:52:30 PM] Lore: Si, yo digo concha/ conchita... Y alguna vez chichi( pero este con amigas)
[7/7/20, 12:56:35 PM] Joe: Haha the memes teach me a lot. Memes, music, and tv shows are my main sources of learning besides talking to you  😂
[7/7/20, 12:57:38 PM] Joe: I’ll try to remember that haha
[7/7/20, 12:59:03 PM] Joe: Dude my pinky finger hurts so bad. I think I sprained it 😣 I don’t know, it hurts to bend it now. I’m always injured haha

[7/7/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I just watch La Casa De Papel over and over hahaha and when I watch something in English I put Spanish subtitles
[7/7/20, 1:03:20 PM] Joe: Or if it has the option i put the audio in spanish if I’m watching a movie or something
[7/7/20, 1:03:55 PM] Lore: Yo también quiero aprender 👂
[7/7/20, 1:04:08 PM] Lore: Jajaja te voy a recomendar algo nuevo
[7/7/20, 1:04:25 PM] Joe: From earlier today. It’s just swollen like I jammed it. It’ll be fine in a few days

[7/7/20, 1:06:25 PM] Joe: Please do haha
[7/7/20, 1:07:29 PM] Joe: To answer your Instagram question....I can barely understand those people. Only some of what they are saying. I don’t understand most of it haha
[7/7/20, 1:08:03 PM] Lore: Jajajajajajajajaja
[7/7/20, 1:08:48 PM] Lore: Jajjajsj dios que risa
[7/7/20, 1:09:01 PM] Joe: I know she was asking people about if they send pictures of their cock and later if the women sent pictures of their pussy. And I understand some of the responses but most of the time I’m lost haha
[7/7/20, 1:09:33 PM] Lore: Demasiado dulce con esa voz diciendo las palabras sjajjaja
[7/7/20, 1:09:44 PM] Lore: Con el acento americano jakajajb
[7/7/20, 1:10:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha 🤷‍♂️
[7/7/20, 1:10:46 PM] Lore: Ohhh, that sucks( como decís vos jaja)
[7/7/20, 1:11:12 PM] Lore: Ahora las quiero aprender en inglés hay también? O solo una manera de decirlo?
[7/7/20, 1:12:58 PM] Joe: Hmmmm let me think 🤔 . There isn’t as many ways in English haha.
[7/7/20, 1:13:19 PM] Lore: Jaja bueno la gente es básica respondiendo, pero hace gracia la manera de decirlo
[7/7/20, 1:13:30 PM] Lore: Uno que hace gestos me hizo gracia jajajaja
[7/7/20, 1:14:04 PM] Lore: Las chicas mienten jaja, algunas... Que rabia que todo sea así tan machista que no puedan decirlo
[7/7/20, 1:14:12 PM] Lore: 👂
[7/7/20, 1:14:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha
‎[7/7/20, 1:15:49 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
[7/7/20, 1:16:34 PM] Joe: Hahaha sorry there aren’t many. I mean, there are a lot of slang words for them that no one uses
[7/7/20, 1:18:13 PM] Joe: Haha I was wondering what you would think of the girls answers 😂
[7/7/20, 1:18:46 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be nice if everyone could just be honest without feeling super judged.

[7/7/20, 1:28:13 PM] Lore: Jajaja que cara sale en el video de inicio como tonta jaja 🥴
[7/7/20, 1:31:57 PM] Joe: I listened to this so many times 😂 but yeah that’s crazy stuff like that is still going on. Poor education or bad parenting, who knows but hopefully the world is moving in the right direction over time
[7/7/20, 1:32:51 PM] Joe: You look good to me as usual
[7/7/20, 1:44:35 PM] Lore: Decía que a una ex compañera del trabajo, un chico de enfadó con ella y se hizo un Instagram falso, con sus fotos, algunas desnuda y agregó a todos sus amigos y contactos de trabajo. Un hijo de puta
[7/7/20, 1:46:10 PM] Lore: Estamos solos con rogel jaja echo de menos a las chicas 🙁 jaja
[7/7/20, 1:47:49 PM] Joe: Lonely Lore haha. How long are they gone for?
[7/7/20, 1:48:53 PM] Joe: Oh yeah after the 1000th time listening I understood the situation. Super messed up what he did!
[7/7/20, 1:50:10 PM] Joe: They made a law here in the states that would classify what he did as “revenge porn” since he posted nudes cause that kind of stuff was a huge problem. Now you can go to jail for doing stuff like that.
[7/7/20, 1:50:38 PM] Lore: Tres días jaja pero normalmente siempre hacemos la cena juntas jaja ahora solo estoy picoteando cosas con la cerveza relax jajaja
[7/7/20, 1:51:25 PM] Lore: Me parece genial
[7/7/20, 1:52:27 PM] Lore: Una chica hace unos años se suicidó acá porque un compañero de trabajo publicó un video de ella teniendo sexo o chupándosela y lo vio toda su empresa  ...
[7/7/20, 1:52:44 PM] Joe: Oh damn so you’re alone for a few days then. Well....with only Rogel haha
[7/7/20, 1:53:30 PM] Lore: Si rogel hoy se hizo pis en el sofá estuve enfadada con el pero luego se siente culpable jaja así que tengo que perdonarlo rápido
[7/7/20, 1:54:07 PM] Joe: Holy shit, gnarly. Yeah I think it is a good law. Especially with how people send those kind of pictures or videos to each other nowadays. Very common.
[7/7/20, 1:54:21 PM] Joe: Shit....you even got me to send a video 😬
[7/7/20, 1:55:00 PM] Lore: 😈😈😈
[7/7/20, 1:55:29 PM] Lore: Jajaja tú vídeo solo lo veo yo. Jamás publicaría eso!
[7/7/20, 1:55:38 PM] Joe: The protection is needed though. So many people do messed up stuff like share those pictures or videos when they get upset or breakup with a person. Or they send it to a friend and it spreads fast. Either way, people are messed up sometimes
[7/7/20, 1:56:04 PM] Joe: I have all the trust in the world for you
[7/7/20, 1:57:43 PM] Lore: Es tremendo, te puede joder la vida. Yo no sé cómo reaccionaria, pero sin duda sería algo humillante. Aunque intentaría machacar públicamente a ese hijo de puta y mostrarlo como algo normal para que otras chicas no sientan eso
[7/7/20, 1:58:33 PM] Lore: Yo también en vos, mucha! No me imaginaria que termines publicando algo o pasándole a tus amigos
[7/7/20, 1:58:52 PM] Lore: Eso espero jaja 🙏
[7/7/20, 2:01:53 PM] Joe: I hope you are never in that situation but I feel like you would handle it well and the boy would end up regretting his decision
[7/7/20, 2:02:37 PM] Joe: What you send to me is for my eyes only! I’d never show anyone haha
[7/7/20, 2:06:40 PM] Lore: Jaja la verdad es que no voy enviando cosas
[7/7/20, 2:08:15 PM] Lore: Y si lo hice fue con confíanza, y nadie que haya tenido en mi vida creo que se comporte así
[7/7/20, 2:09:34 PM] Lore: Cuando lo repetimos? Jaja
‎[7/7/20, 2:10:17 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
[7/7/20, 2:11:59 PM] Joe: Hahah I don’t knoooow 😂 now? Or whenever you send me more sexy stuff haha you get me “worked up”
[7/7/20, 2:12:09 PM] Lore: Jajaja a lo mejor es verdad, pero lo dudo.. igual por la familia o algo de eso o vergüenza
[7/7/20, 2:12:46 PM] Lore: Yo creo que diría la verdad con educación claro, jaja mi padre y mi hermano me dirían algo seguro .. Lorena! 🙊
[7/7/20, 2:13:22 PM] Lore: Jaja vos también podés enviar esas cosas para hacerme "trabajar"
[7/7/20, 2:14:22 PM] Joe: Hahah I am not sexy like you though 😂
‎[7/7/20, 2:15:48 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/7/20, 2:17:17 PM] Joe: It’s easier when you make a request haha. I don’t even know what is sexy to you hahah. Fuck I’m the worst 🤦‍♂️
[7/7/20, 2:18:00 PM] Lore: Ahí va
‎[7/7/20, 2:18:12 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[7/7/20, 2:18:45 PM] Joe: Hahahahahaha
[7/7/20, 2:18:55 PM] Joe: 💩
[7/7/20, 2:19:41 PM] Lore: Boludo se la tuve que arrancar con una rama
[7/7/20, 2:19:57 PM] Lore: Jajaja le voy a decir a Luchi que esto no está pagado jajaj
[7/7/20, 2:25:47 PM] Joe: Aaaah haha gross 😝
[7/7/20, 2:26:02 PM] Joe: Rogel with his little poopoo butt hahaha
[7/7/20, 2:26:18 PM] Joe: Luchi owes you one

[7/7/20, 2:32:50 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[7/7/20, 2:32:55 PM] Lore: Te estaba preparando
[7/7/20, 2:33:23 PM] Lore: Pero rogel llevaba mucho rato sacudiendo el culo y esa caca no se caia al suelo jajaj
[7/7/20, 2:36:38 PM] Lore: Pero te apetece? Jaja es que nunca lo decís vos
[7/7/20, 2:37:28 PM] Joe: What don't i say?
[7/7/20, 2:37:43 PM] Joe: That i want to have sexy time with you? hahah
[7/7/20, 2:37:49 PM] Joe: cause i do
[7/7/20, 2:42:54 PM] Lore: Jaja que nunca decís vos de hacerlo, te provoco yo jaja
[7/7/20, 2:47:08 PM] Joe: Haha I’m easily provoked by you. I’m really sorry. Half of it is me being shy and not knowing what to even send you. And the other half is the schedule. I’m hornier in the morning and evening I guess 🤷‍♂️
[7/7/20, 2:47:49 PM] Joe: Ejsoixdjeis I feel like I disappoint you haha fuck 🤦‍♂️
[7/7/20, 2:50:13 PM] Lore: Jajaja osea que este no es tu horario 😅
[7/7/20, 2:51:06 PM] Lore: De estar horny jaja
[7/7/20, 2:51:33 PM] Lore: Yo por las mañanas tambiénn, y luego depende el día
[7/7/20, 2:53:24 PM] Lore: Nahhh, solo te lo digo pq me gustó las veces que lo hicimos y pq veo que no podés estar acá ... Entonces de vez en cuando puede ser una manera para que estemos más unidos jaja  , no sé...
[7/7/20, 2:53:44 PM] Joe: I can’t lie, morning sex is kind of my favorite 🙊🙈
[7/7/20, 2:55:02 PM] Joe: Haha it’s just a little more work to get in the mood in the middle of the day 😆 plus I get so sleepy afterwards hahaha
[7/7/20, 2:55:50 PM] Joe: Yeah I know what you mean
[7/7/20, 2:58:28 PM] Lore: 😬😬😬
[7/7/20, 2:58:33 PM] Lore: Jaja recibido!
[7/7/20, 2:58:48 PM] Lore: No problemm
[7/7/20, 3:05:32 PM] Lore: Tu día hoy bien? Supiste algo de ese chico o aún sigue desparecido?
[7/7/20, 3:07:33 PM] Joe: Today is alright. Nothing special haha. The guy never got back to me. Disappeared 😡
[7/7/20, 3:08:53 PM] Joe: And when the hell is Spain going to start letting US citizens visit!? Right now it’s no go. I think they do another update in a week or so
[7/7/20, 3:09:18 PM] Joe: I just want to buy my ticket and go see you
[7/7/20, 3:12:30 PM] Lore: Nada, olvidate de el, poco serio. Ya aparecerá
[7/7/20, 3:14:07 PM] Lore: Mmm ojalá, pero lamentablemente acá hay rumores que es posible un rebrote y otro encierro. Hay comunidades en España que ya vuelven al confinamiento
[7/7/20, 3:14:31 PM] Lore: Las clases en sept en las universidades y colegios están preparadas para ser a distancia por las dudas...
[7/7/20, 3:15:58 PM] Joe: This sucks
[7/7/20, 3:16:01 PM] Joe: We’ll have to meet in Costa Rica haha
[7/7/20, 3:16:19 PM] Lore: No sabemos que es lo que va a pasar, pero es un mierda... Yo de verdad quería verte
[7/7/20, 3:18:04 PM] Joe: Even if everything goes to shit and we can’t be together I’ll visit you someday. Even if it’s far in the future and we can only be friends I would still love to visit you. But that’s not what I want. I want to see you sooner rather than later haha
[7/7/20, 3:18:46 PM] Joe: I’m trying to do all I can to get to you but the situation of the world is fucked. I have one goal right now haha get to Spain to see you
[7/7/20, 3:24:41 PM] Lore: Ohh sos tan transparente al hablar y tú actitud que no me gustaría que seas solo mi amigo, aunque igual si pasa mucho tiempo tendré que aceptar que sea así
[7/7/20, 3:27:10 PM] Lore: Lo sé, te juro que estoy deseando que tengas el pasaporte y el viaje para poder verte jajaj Joe nos tenemos que ver,  si o si. Esta pandemia pasará y la gente podrá viajar..
[7/7/20, 3:29:57 PM] Joe: I really really don’t want to just be friends. I just don’t want to keep you waiting for too long haha it’s hard to explain. 

But you’re who I want and I want you as more than a friend.
[7/7/20, 3:32:29 PM] Joe: You’re right. It’ll happen eventually! But It feels like it has been so long already that we’ve been talking. I just really want to go to you now haha the ultimate test of patience 😂
[7/8/20, 12:51:17 AM] Lore: Me quedé super dormida!!!!
[7/8/20, 1:01:39 AM] Joe: All good. I was sleeping well until my aunt from Hawaii arrived haha. My dad just picked her up from the airport. They’re in the other room talking hellaaaa loud!

[7/8/20, 1:14:50 AM] Lore: Jajaja durmió conmigo, debajo de las sábanas se ponían en mi tripa
[7/8/20, 1:15:35 AM] Lore: Para vos también hay amor a distancia jjj
[7/8/20, 1:16:46 AM] Lore: Entonces si ninguno de los dos queremos ser amigos, no lo seremos. Jaja (solo amigos)
[7/8/20, 1:18:25 AM] Joe: Haha hella sweet
[7/8/20, 1:18:41 AM] Lore: Si es que llevamos mucho tiempo hablando.. y con este horario nuevo da la sensación que más jaja.. pero si vos realmente tenés ganas de vernos, sabes que yo también. No importa esperar, lo haré.. pq se que sos algo bueno y en algún momento llegarás jajaj
‎[7/8/20, 1:18:54 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 1:20:59 AM] Joe: Damn you’re the best haha sounds good to me. I’ll keep checking the status of travel until they’ll let me come see you haha
[7/8/20, 1:21:16 AM] Joe: They can’t stop us forever 😂
[7/8/20, 1:23:59 AM] Lore: Esa es la actitud! 💪
[7/8/20, 1:24:42 AM] Lore: No pienses que me haces esperar, sé que estás haciendo lo posible
[7/8/20, 1:25:21 AM] Lore: Lo único es que me da mucha rabia cuando alguien me dice que cerrarán las fronteras o escucho noticias de rebrotes jajaj
‎[7/8/20, 1:25:34 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 1:26:53 AM] Joe: Hahaha this is me when someone says I’m not allowed to travel to Spain
[7/8/20, 1:28:16 AM] Joe: Thaaaanks. Yeah I’m trying haha

[7/8/20, 1:32:12 AM] Lore: *cuando
[7/8/20, 1:33:06 AM] Joe: Hahah we are doing a terrible job here. It sucks. I bet that will make us one of the last countries that Spain opens the border for 🤬🤬
[7/8/20, 1:33:40 AM] Lore: Bah acá lo están haciendo re mal también
[7/8/20, 1:34:00 AM] Lore: El gobierno y principalmente la gente
[7/8/20, 1:34:28 AM] Lore: El otro día un compañero me dijo que fue a una discoteca y que todo el mundo estaba sin mascarilla! Imagínate ....
[7/8/20, 1:35:19 AM] Joe: Oh god dammit what the hell people!
[7/8/20, 1:36:36 AM] Joe: It’s so hard to get so many humans to work towards a single goal. This virus stuff needs to be over. Ugh this is ridiculous
‎[7/8/20, 1:38:01 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 1:38:18 AM] Lore: Si, acá muchísimos así
[7/8/20, 1:38:27 AM] Lore: O gente que viene a mi tienda y se deja la nariz fuera
[7/8/20, 1:38:31 AM] Lore: Y yo...
‎[7/8/20, 1:38:50 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 1:39:54 AM] Joe: Hahaha I hate seeing the mask on someone’s face with the nose out! So stupid! Crazy world 😂
[7/8/20, 1:41:21 AM] Joe: It makes me wonder if they are just wearing it to be technically following the rules, but they really don’t want to wear it. Or if they’re just not very educated and don’t know what they’re doing. I guess the answer could be a little of both haha
[7/8/20, 1:45:07 AM] Lore: Totalmente....! Igual las mascarillas son d solo un uso, se de que gente que las usa más horas...pero es difícil.. a mí en algún momento me pasó de no tener más y no me da tiempo de ir a la farmacia
[7/8/20, 1:45:37 AM] Lore: Pero hay que ser consciente.. es que me da tanta pena boludo como los médicos y enfermeros intentaron combatir todo esto y la gente no valora una mierda
[7/8/20, 1:46:22 AM] Lore: Y la gente que perdió sus negocios, eso me mata. Con el esfuerzo que lleva un emprendimiento y algo tan lindo.. que ya no puedas sostenerlo ...
[7/8/20, 1:48:03 AM] Joe: Yeah I have a lot of family that works in hospitals so I don’t appreciate people’s negligence haha
[7/8/20, 1:48:33 AM] Lore: Escucha y tu familia, tus abuelos y eso.. salen de casa?
[7/8/20, 1:48:52 AM] Joe: And I really want to have my own business one day. It’s super difficult as it is. I can’t imagine having something I worked hard to build get crushed because of something completely out of my control
[7/8/20, 1:49:59 AM] Lore: Si es horrible, es que es tal cual, fuera de tu control...
[7/8/20, 1:50:20 AM] Lore: Que te gustaría emprender?
[7/8/20, 1:50:59 AM] Joe: My family has been pretty good about staying home. And no one really visits my grandparents right now cause they’re scared to get them sick
[7/8/20, 1:51:55 AM] Joe: I don’t know. But I don’t like working for other people and I feel like I can find someway to create value in the world
[7/8/20, 1:52:16 AM] Lore: Claro, es lo correcto. Mi madre me dijo que tengo que ir menos a casa por la abuela.. que si me voy de vacaciones vaya antes..no después.. raro jaja 😭
[7/8/20, 1:52:40 AM] Lore: Por ejemplo....?
[7/8/20, 1:53:33 AM] Lore: Algo de codificación? Algo de skatecamp? O algo diferente?
[7/8/20, 1:53:48 AM] Joe: Mmm well technically I already started a business. I have one for my freelance coding stuff.
[7/8/20, 1:54:54 AM] Joe: But yeah other than that, maybe a store, online and/or in real life, not sure. But I don’t know what I would sell haha.
[7/8/20, 1:55:30 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/8/20, 1:55:52 AM] Joe: Hahah I know I’m terrible 😆
[7/8/20, 1:56:11 AM] Lore: Una online mejor, una física es 🤯
[7/8/20, 1:57:13 AM] Joe: Haha true. We’ll see.
[7/8/20, 1:57:44 AM] Lore: Si yo también quiero emprender, no me gusta trabajar para otros
[7/8/20, 1:58:04 AM] Joe: I wish I had a better idea of what business I want to create but it’s pretty hard to come up with a solid business plan for a lot of ideas haha
[7/8/20, 1:58:12 AM] Lore: Pero si me gusta tener un equipo, y trabajar con más gente. Así que trabajarían para mí jaja y les podría unas buenas condiciones para que estén contentos
[7/8/20, 1:59:55 AM] Lore: A mí me gustaría un hostel boutique... O comprar casas, reformarlas y luego venderlas..."tipo inmobiliaria"
‎[7/8/20, 2:00:08 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 2:00:30 AM] Lore: Jamás!!!!! Jajaja
[7/8/20, 2:01:29 AM] Joe: Oooh Ok. Those ideas would be cool. I thought about doing something like that. Be a bed and breakfast host or something hahah
[7/8/20, 2:03:07 AM] Joe: Alright babe everyone finally went to bed so I can sleep now. I’m glad we got to talk a little extra today though haha
[7/8/20, 2:03:27 AM] Lore: Sii, solo te quita tiempo las reservas.. podés estar haciendo trabajos por tu cuenta
[7/8/20, 2:03:45 AM] Lore: Y la gente no va con energía mala porque está de vacaciones 😅
[7/8/20, 2:04:59 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s true. It would be nice to work where most people are already happy 😆
[7/8/20, 2:05:12 AM] Joe: Ok I’m going to sleeeeep now 😴
[7/8/20, 2:05:13 AM] Lore: Jjjj muy bien bombón, descansa!!! Buenas nochesss

[7/8/20, 12:03:36 PM] Lore: Jajaja te llevas bien con los niños
[7/8/20, 12:06:04 PM] Joe: Hahah just the ones that actually like skateboarding. The ones that don’t want to be there probably hate me 😂
[7/8/20, 12:07:54 PM] Lore: Jaja no entiendo como mandan a niños que no quieran ir jaja
[7/8/20, 12:09:41 PM] Lore: Bueno ese niño seguro lo está pasando bien y además comiendo. Y vos también niño adulto jajaja
[7/8/20, 12:19:49 PM] Joe: Happens all the time haha. Parents have to go to work and just pick a camp they think the kid will like
[7/8/20, 12:20:44 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m a man child 😂
‎[7/8/20, 12:21:10 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/8/20, 12:22:52 PM] Joe: Today was pretty fun though. I got an offer to teach a couple of kids private lessons next week. 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. Should make up for not getting that other job a little bit haha
[7/8/20, 12:25:49 PM] Lore: Jajaja espero no ser así cuando sea madre y poder elegir un campamento que le guste
[7/8/20, 12:26:04 PM] Lore: 😂
[7/8/20, 12:26:45 PM] Lore: Sii? Que biennn! Menos preocupaciones seguro jaja qué tal son los niños?
[7/8/20, 12:30:24 PM] Joe: Haha same when I’m a dad. I don’t think it’s on purpose. The parents and even the kids might think they’ll like it but when they find out how hard it is and how much they get hurt some lose interest
[7/8/20, 12:31:34 PM] Joe: It’s two kids that are in camp this week. Honestly they’re some of my least favorite kids haha but the parents are paying good
[7/8/20, 12:32:43 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[7/8/20, 12:33:29 PM] Lore: Bueno seguro con ellos ahora estarás más unido, el dinero lo hará jajaj

[7/8/20, 12:35:23 PM] Lore: No sé si entenderás los comentarios, pero es demasiado dulce!!!
[7/8/20, 12:35:50 PM] Lore: El empieza diciendo " esperen, canten otra vez por favor"  jajaja
[7/8/20, 12:39:55 PM] Joe: Hahahah this kid is so stoked!
[7/8/20, 12:40:03 PM] Joe: “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida!!” Hahahah
[7/8/20, 12:43:09 PM] Joe: The gasp at 1 min 30 sec Hahahaha
[7/8/20, 12:43:11 PM] Lore: Muy bienn rulitos
[7/8/20, 12:43:57 PM] Lore: Siiii jajaj ese me encantó, con las máscaras de toy story creo. Se queda sin respiración jajajaja
[7/8/20, 12:47:47 PM] Joe: He got so many gifts haha. He was so excited about the colors and book haha and I don’t know what it was after the chocolate but he was hella happy about whatever it was
[7/8/20, 12:55:20 PM] Lore: Si, con pequeñas cosas pero importantes para el que las disfruta
[7/8/20, 12:55:42 PM] Lore: Me hace sonreír mucho cuando lo veo, digo que niño tan genial " Dieguito"
[7/8/20, 1:02:32 PM] Joe: Haha that’s definitely a video you can watch to help get in a better mood. How can you stay mad watching that little dude be so happy?? Haha impossible
[7/8/20, 2:38:27 PM] Joe: Dookie died last night. I just found out 😢
[7/8/20, 3:11:11 PM] Lore: Que??????
[7/8/20, 3:11:16 PM] Lore: Noooo!!!!!
[7/8/20, 3:11:32 PM] Lore: 😯😣
[7/8/20, 3:11:41 PM] Lore: Que le pasó a Dookie???
[7/8/20, 3:13:42 PM] Joe: I don’t know. He hasn’t been eating much lately and didn’t seem well. My dad found him upstairs this morning
[7/8/20, 3:14:02 PM] Joe: We’re going to bury him in the backyard now
[7/8/20, 3:15:36 PM] Joe: Poor little Dookie 😔
[7/8/20, 3:54:37 PM] Lore: Bombón, lo siento mucho mucho!!!

[7/8/20, 5:05:21 PM] Lore: Cómo estás? Tu familia?
[7/8/20, 5:05:56 PM] Lore: Se que es un animal, pero muchas veces forman parte de la familia. No sé cuántos años tenía Dookie..
[7/8/20, 5:10:31 PM] Joe: We’re good. It’s just me and my dad here. My mom went with my aunt up north to see my cousin. We had dookie for almost 10 years. He was definitely a part of the family.
[7/8/20, 5:11:10 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/8/20, 5:12:31 PM] Joe: So weird though. I totally didn’t think he was going to die
[7/8/20, 5:25:31 PM] Lore: Ya, ni yo.. recuerdo cuando me lo enseñaste en video que estaba un poquito raro
[7/8/20, 5:25:37 PM] Lore: Lo siento mucho Joe, de verdad
[7/8/20, 5:25:42 PM] Lore: Te daría un gran abrazo
[7/8/20, 5:41:02 PM] Joe: I really appreciate you. Thanks a lot. It sucks but that’s life. There is always an end 😔

[7/9/20, 10:24:06 AM] Joe: Duuude my coworker fell so hard I had to write an accident report on it. He scraped his face on the ground 😬
[7/9/20, 10:24:19 AM] Joe: Hope your day is going smoother than mine haha
[7/9/20, 10:54:02 AM] Lore: Hola!
[7/9/20, 10:54:19 AM] Lore: Que putada!
[7/9/20, 10:54:59 AM] Lore: Esta bien o fue muy fuerte? Quien tu compañero de trabajo, el que firmaste que se parece a Shelby?
[7/9/20, 11:45:16 AM] Joe: Hahah yeah the one that looks like Shelby. He is ok. Just had a cut under his eye. Could’ve been worse I guess
[7/9/20, 11:55:40 AM] Lore: Filmaste
[7/9/20, 11:56:00 AM] Lore: Me tiene harta el traductor jajaja
[7/9/20, 11:56:25 AM] Lore: Pobrecito espero que no sea nada
[7/9/20, 12:06:32 PM] Joe: jahah sí el traductor no es tan divertido cuando tienes que usarlo. Lo siento. Voy a enviar mensajes ya traducidos por un rato para que no lo necesites
[7/9/20, 12:09:09 PM] Lore: Nono no lo decís por vos
‎[7/9/20, 12:09:20 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
[7/9/20, 12:09:40 PM] Lore: Jajaja por mi! Que parece que no se escribir ... Puse firmaste en vez de filmaste
[7/9/20, 12:10:03 PM] Lore: Normalmente me entienden pero vos si lo pones en traductor vas a entender cualquier cosa jajaj
[7/9/20, 12:10:46 PM] Lore: Hella igual jajaja
[7/9/20, 12:16:04 PM] Joe: Oh hahaha is it because I read it and disappear for a while to translate? My bad 😂
[7/9/20, 12:16:53 PM] Lore: Que??
[7/9/20, 12:17:07 PM] Joe: Nevermiiiind haha
[7/9/20, 12:17:09 PM] Joe: Voy a cubrir unas horas en el parque. Así que estoy aquí por 3 horas más para monitorear
‎[7/9/20, 12:17:38 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/9/20, 12:18:07 PM] Lore: Jaja me refería a esto
[7/9/20, 12:18:38 PM] Lore: Al que firmaste no! Al que filmaste! Jaja no es lo mismo. Firmar que Filmar
[7/9/20, 12:19:19 PM] Joe: Aaaaah ok ok
[7/9/20, 12:22:04 PM] Lore: Por eso decía que estoy harta del traductor de mi teléfono que me escribo una cosa y me pone otra. Y claro, alguien que entienda español, lo entiende. Pero si vos intentas entenderlo o traducirlo, tiene otro significado
[7/9/20, 12:22:47 PM] Lore: Que tal hoy el trabajo?

[7/9/20, 12:52:35 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
[7/9/20, 12:53:19 PM] Joe: 😂
[7/9/20, 12:53:38 PM] Joe: Good. I’m just sitting in the shade right now keeping an eye on the park
[7/9/20, 12:53:49 PM] Joe: Easy work
[7/9/20, 1:10:38 PM] Lore: Muy bien, yo recién saqué a Rogel a hacer pis
[7/9/20, 1:10:59 PM] Lore: Hoy fue bueno y no hizo caca ni pis en la casa
[7/9/20, 1:17:49 PM] Joe: Haha that’s a relief 😅
[7/9/20, 1:18:48 PM] Joe: I think I like working at the skatepark too much hahah all I do is skate around or sit all day haha. I used to use them time to learn stuff when they’d let me sit in the building but now i have to be in the park or at the front all the time
[7/9/20, 1:28:30 PM] Lore: Jaja eso es bueno! Trabajar en lo que te gusta, me alegro!!
[7/9/20, 1:36:40 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. Getting paid to skate is awesome. The only time it’s not fun is when a parent gets mad when I tell them their kid can’t ride a scooter or bike at the park haha
[7/9/20, 1:37:25 PM] Joe: Some people get so upset when I tell them no but I’m just doing my job 🤷‍♂️
[7/9/20, 1:38:49 PM] Lore: Jajaja me suena
[7/9/20, 1:39:35 PM] Lore: Cuánto llevas trabajando de profe de skate?
[7/9/20, 1:42:56 PM] Joe: Mmmm 4 years now
[7/9/20, 1:43:40 PM] Joe: Well I’ve been working 4 years at the skatepark but I’ve only done 3 years of lessons. The first year I just did monitoring of the park
[7/9/20, 1:50:23 PM] Lore: Que bien, ya es tiempo! Te divertis y encima te pagan, es un lujo eso
[7/9/20, 1:59:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah and every time I leave I tell them not to fire me so I can work next summer if I come back.
[7/9/20, 2:59:47 PM] Joe: Some lady just asked me to tutor her kid 😂 like not in skateboarding but actually tutor them for school haha. Weird
[7/9/20, 3:39:47 PM] Lore: 🙄
[7/9/20, 3:40:58 PM] Lore: Cómo? Que le des clases a su hijo, pero el ya está apuntado no?
‎[7/9/20, 3:43:38 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/9/20, 3:47:13 PM] Joe: Hahahah whaaaat??
[7/9/20, 3:49:40 PM] Joe: The kids mom talked to me today while I was monitoring the park and asked if I would be interested in tutoring her son. He isn’t in camp or anything. I’ve seen that kid at the park a few times and his mom knows that he likes me so she thought it would be easier for me to teach him his school stuff instead of her 😂
‎[7/9/20, 3:50:00 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[7/9/20, 3:56:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha you look hella sleepy
[7/9/20, 3:58:45 PM] Lore: Jaja ahhh! Pero bien no? Eso es más trabajo, los padres te ven bueno para entretener a sus hijos jaja
[7/9/20, 3:59:31 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look beautiful as always!
[7/9/20, 4:00:24 PM] Joe: I am a little worried about how much work teaching actual school work is going to be haha
[7/9/20, 4:00:55 PM] Joe: But I’m willing to try it out and see how it goes. We’ll do like 25 minutes of school then take a skateboard break and repeat haha
[7/9/20, 4:01:25 PM] Lore: Jaja con la camiseta arrugada y me levanté con una pierna levantada de la malla.. no sé como..pero me gusta dormir jaja
[7/9/20, 4:02:19 PM] Lore: 🥰
‎[7/9/20, 4:04:09 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
[7/9/20, 4:04:41 PM] Lore: Pero ya empezaste no? o van a cambiar los horarios del campamento?
[7/9/20, 4:04:50 PM] Lore: 😂😂
[7/9/20, 4:06:47 PM] Joe: No this would be a new thing. The mom just asked me this today and got my phone number. The kid is not a part of camp. It would probably be in the afternoon after I’m done working camp
[7/9/20, 4:10:02 PM] Lore: Si eso lo entendí, pero no entendí pq estabas un poco preocupado, por el horario del trabajo del skatepark? Para compaginarlo?
[7/9/20, 4:11:47 PM] Joe: Ooh haha sorry. I’m worried because teaching school work isn’t the same as teaching skateboarding. Or maybe it is? I don’t know haha.
[7/9/20, 4:12:45 PM] Lore: Ahhhhh
[7/9/20, 4:12:51 PM] Joe: I just don’t want to do a bad job and it would be my first time doing something like that
[7/9/20, 4:13:19 PM] Lore: Que boluda no había entendido, estaba dormida antes y no leí que era del colegio
[7/9/20, 4:13:40 PM] Lore: Pero te ofreció que lo ayudes a hacer sus deberes?
[7/9/20, 4:14:51 PM] Joe: Yeah she wants me to help him study and do school work. With skateboarding breaks in between.
[7/9/20, 4:15:16 PM] Joe: She said she was having a hard time getting him interested in learning anything for school during quarantine
[7/9/20, 4:15:21 PM] Lore: Pero y como vas. Hacer el?
[7/9/20, 4:15:41 PM] Lore: *Pero y como vas a hacer eso?
[7/9/20, 4:15:46 PM] Joe: Actually she said “I tried to teach him for the first 2 months of quarantine and we almost killed each other” 😬
[7/9/20, 4:16:26 PM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/9/20, 4:16:29 PM] Lore: Pobre madre
[7/9/20, 4:16:34 PM] Lore: Que edad tiene el niño?
[7/9/20, 4:16:40 PM] Joe: He is in 1st grade so everything I have to teach him is supposed to be easy
[7/9/20, 4:17:02 PM] Joe: Not sure how old first grade is. 6 or 7 maybe?
[7/9/20, 4:17:30 PM] Lore: Pero cómo vas a ayudarlo en el skatepark? Se concentrará? Vos no podrías estar pendiente de vigilar el skatepark no? Debería ser fuera dw tu horario o como?
[7/9/20, 4:18:22 PM] Lore: Jaja es que acá es diferente
[7/9/20, 4:19:13 PM] Joe: Yeah she sounded like she needed help haha. But also she is a white lady and her kid is brown and she was like “I think it would be good for an older boy to help him. Especially someone that looks like him. And he seems to have gravitated towards you”. 

I’m down to try it 🤷‍♂️
[7/9/20, 4:19:57 PM] Lore: Bueno acá sería primer año de primaria esa edad yo creo
[7/9/20, 4:20:17 PM] Joe: We’re going to schedule something when I’m not working the skatepark. I don’t think we’ll be at the skatepark when I teach him either. Probably just going to skate near his house
[7/9/20, 4:20:40 PM] Lore: 💛
[7/9/20, 4:21:52 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s what it is. I mean we also do “kindergarten” but that’s more like daycare disguised as school for 5 year olds haha
[7/9/20, 4:22:57 PM] Lore: Jaja me encanta, me imagino que los niños se te dan genial. Este seguramente te vea cómo modelo y puedas ayudarlo con cosas de clase como si fueses un hermano mayor.. la madre pensó bien yo creo
[7/9/20, 4:24:09 PM] Lore: eso de disfrazada jaja de acuerdo
[7/9/20, 4:25:47 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully. I’ll let you know how it goes. She might not even contact me 🤷‍♂️
[7/9/20, 4:27:19 PM] Joe: She’ll flake like the other guy haha and the only ones who will be true to their word is the 2 little devils I’m supposed to give skate lessons to hahaha I’m really thinking about cancelling those lessons. Those kids are not pleasant 😂

[7/9/20, 11:05:13 PM] Joe: I don’t know why, but even though we talked about sending messages anytime I still try not to send too many when I know you’re asleep haha but I’ll take note that you like waking up to a message or video
[7/9/20, 11:05:22 PM] Lore: Dios también le daría besos a socks es taaaan linda, esa cara por favor..

[7/9/20, 11:11:24 PM] Lore: Jjjjj
[7/9/20, 11:11:43 PM] Lore: Que hiciste hoy, exactamente?
[7/9/20, 11:13:28 PM] Joe: I worked at the park from 8:30-3 then I came home and did some coding. Took a nap. Ate food. Went to my friends house. I think that was it 🤔
[7/9/20, 11:15:50 PM] Lore: Jaja muy bien lo bueno del skatepark es que acabas prontob
[7/9/20, 11:18:20 PM] Joe: Yeah I have a lot of time during the day. I need to start building a new website or something to fill the time. I’ve just been doing “coding challenges” where you try to solve the problem given to you.
[7/9/20, 11:19:26 PM] Joe: But right now I’m super sleepy haha. I’m going to bed now 😴
[7/9/20, 11:19:55 PM] Joe: Have a good day! I’ll talk to you soon 😘
[7/9/20, 11:21:13 PM] Lore: Muy bien! Vas avanzando así para cuando encuentres otro trabajo de codificación
[7/9/20, 11:23:20 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I have to make sure I’m ready for the next time a job comes up. 

Alright babe I’m passing out any second. I can feel it 😂

[7/10/20, 3:45:34 PM] Lore: A mí me parece ridícula esa placa, pero me hace gracia que la tenga el ... Jaja es como todo menos peligroso, es un perro mimado 🤭
[7/10/20, 3:49:17 PM] Joe: I think it’s funny cause it’s a skull tag on a little tiny not very dangerous dog.  I like that haha

[7/10/20, 3:59:24 PM] Lore: Si lo sé jajaj tus fotos y vídeos son super antiguos
[7/10/20, 4:01:10 PM] Joe: Yeah I just don’t really like to post stuff I guess. I’ll just keep the photos and videos for myself. I share them you instead haha
[7/10/20, 4:04:09 PM] Lore: Soy "adicta" a tus fotos y vídeos que me envías 😂
[7/10/20, 4:09:31 PM] Joe: Hahah I send so much of me doing absolutely nothing. Or hanging out with the dogs. I never know what to send you but I want you to see me. I’ve sent a lot of stuff but I’m going to keep sending things until you tell me to stop haha
[7/10/20, 4:14:54 PM] Lore: Jajaj si los vídeos que nos enviamos son naturales y al momento, aunque no hacemos mucho ..pero a mí me gustan así te veoooo
[7/10/20, 4:19:58 PM] Joe: I send them when I can haha I’ve been trying to remember to do it more often. I also want to send more of me practicing Spanish.

[7/11/20, 6:33:47 AM] Joe: Buenos díasss
[7/11/20, 6:34:40 AM] Joe: I almost forgot I picked up some more short shifts this weekend. I have to monitor the park 7:45-12 today and tomorrow.
[7/11/20, 6:57:40 AM] Lore: Buenos días!!!
[7/11/20, 6:58:26 AM] Lore: Jaja bueno unas horitas y te queda todo el día libre
[7/11/20, 6:58:45 AM] Lore: Yo salí ya de trabajar! 💃
[7/11/20, 7:00:26 AM] Joe: Haha yeah it’s not bad. Plus my friends like to sleep in so they’ll barely be ready for the day when I’m getting off work.
[7/11/20, 7:00:49 AM] Joe: Hurray! What’s the plan for the rest of your day?
[7/11/20, 7:04:09 AM] Lore: Jaja saliste de fiesta ya? O se quedan en casa hasta tarde?
[7/11/20, 7:04:15 AM] Lore: Sierraaaa
[7/11/20, 7:05:11 AM] Lore: Comí en el trabajo, me compré una camiseta en una tienda de enfrente que me gustaba haha solo 4eu me salió
[7/11/20, 7:06:37 AM] Lore: Hay rebajas ahora jaja a ver si veo algún vestido o bikini para la playita
[7/11/20, 7:08:51 AM] Joe: I’m not doing any partying 🤷‍♂️ i go to my close friends houses and chill but that’s about it. 

I don’t think they’re partying either. Just lazy and wake up late
[7/11/20, 7:09:04 AM] Joe: Haha of course. Have fun!
[7/11/20, 7:09:56 AM] Joe: Damn that’s hella cheap haha. Good find. Send pictures later 😆
[7/11/20, 7:10:47 AM] Joe: Oh yeah everyone has to clear that inventory that’s been sitting. Time for good deals. I’m sure you’ll find some great stuff

[7/11/20, 7:13:15 AM] Lore: Nosotras también hacemos lo mismo, ya no salimos de fiesta.. disfrutamos del campo o en casa.. excepto cuando vamos a la playa que ahí sí que igual salimos a algún bar con ambiente
[7/11/20, 7:14:08 AM] Lore: como cuando estés aburrido.. jajaj Joee 😣
[7/11/20, 7:15:50 AM] Lore: Vaaale, vale hablame cuando quieras estaré de viaje a la sierra . Que se haga ameno ese rato en el skatepark! 🛹😘

[7/11/20, 8:08:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’m getting a little dark being out here everyday 😂
[7/11/20, 8:09:31 AM] Joe: It’s super nice. Except I burned my tongue with my coffee hahah shit

[7/11/20, 8:39:13 AM] Lore: Jaja le dije al chico leche templada unas gotitas y me quema el café la mano
[7/11/20, 8:40:27 AM] Lore: Q tipo de donut te gusta a vos? Yo casi siempre pido el clásico pero relleno de dulce de leche ( típico de Uru y arg)
[7/11/20, 8:48:46 AM] Joe: I usually get regular glazed doughnuts or doughnut holes haha
[7/11/20, 8:48:50 AM] Joe: Super plain
‎[7/11/20, 8:58:57 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/11/20, 8:59:59 AM] Lore: Doughnuts 😂 en español lo cambiamos un poquito jajaj Donuts 🤣
[7/11/20, 9:01:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha we do like our doughnuts. It’s weirdly considered a breakfast food here 😂
[7/11/20, 9:02:12 AM] Joe: Hahah spanish way of spelling it makes more sense.
[7/11/20, 9:45:07 AM] Lore: Jaja vos desayunas Donuts y tortitas siempre?
[7/11/20, 9:46:04 AM] Lore: En España cambian muchísimo las palabras, siempre hay crítica por eso jaja muy "spanglish"
[7/11/20, 10:01:41 AM] Joe: Haha noooo. Usually eggs and avocados or something like that.
[7/11/20, 10:02:38 AM] Joe: Doughnuts are too sweet for me to eat for breakfast most of the time. I was definitely eating a lot of pancakes when I was staying with my sister but haven’t had any since I came back to California
[7/11/20, 10:12:43 AM] Lore: Ahhhh mejor jaja
‎[7/11/20, 10:16:05 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/11/20, 10:25:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha I eat relatively healthy....for an American 😂
[7/11/20, 11:11:07 AM] Joe: I actually just watched a video recently about Americans weird sugary breakfasts. We eat super sweet and/or heavy breakfast compared to the rest of the world. The pictures of breakfast you send me always look super light and healthy compared to what is typical here
[7/11/20, 11:43:01 AM] Lore: Jajaja si en Uruguay se come un poco mal también, bizcochos con café o mate .. pero yo estoy más acostumbrada a los desayunos de España, me gusta mucho más desayunar salado que dulce
[7/11/20, 11:45:41 AM] Lore: Tostadas acompañadas con queso, aguacate, tomate o pavo.. te voy a hacer uno de esos desayunos algún día en la cama jaja como un rey
[7/11/20, 11:51:18 AM] Joe: Hahahah you’re the fucking best!
[7/11/20, 11:53:41 AM] Joe: I got to leave a few minutes early. Time for some food! I only had a coffee this morning.

[7/11/20, 12:13:29 PM] Lore: Cifras mundiales
[7/11/20, 12:13:41 PM] Lore: Jajaja este me encanta
[7/11/20, 12:16:24 PM] Joe: The number is getting big. I was looking at the way the 1918 spanish flu worked out. Took 2 to 3 years before the infection rate went way down. This could take a while
[7/11/20, 12:16:38 PM] Joe: So shitty haha
[7/11/20, 12:27:07 PM] Lore: Si yo había escuchado que esto se alargaría dos años
[7/11/20, 12:27:55 PM] Lore: Es tremendo...
[7/11/20, 12:32:28 PM] Joe: Damn that would suuuuck. It seems like a possibility though. I really hope this doesn’t last that long.
[7/11/20, 12:32:40 PM] Joe: 2 years of this madness is too much haha
[7/11/20, 12:34:09 PM] Lore: No vamos a olvidar esto nunca si son dos años, de mierda
[7/11/20, 12:35:21 PM] Lore: Esperemos que se pueda controlar, yo creo que tendrá que ser por un países.. algunos se irán a la mierda otros serán más inteligentes
[7/11/20, 12:35:52 PM] Lore: Espero que los nuestros sean de los inteligentes jaja 🙏
[7/11/20, 12:37:05 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. But I’m already going to remember this forever
[7/11/20, 12:37:38 PM] Joe: Hopefully we aren’t in two countries that are going to go to shit haha
[7/11/20, 12:38:37 PM] Joe: Whoops haha I totally said the same thing before I read this. But we might be in two of the worst countries right now 😂

[7/11/20, 12:57:34 PM] Joe: I have no idea haha. They really didn’t give me a good timeframe. Just said it would be delayed. Usually it’s 6-8 weeks I believe but that’s without the delay 😬
[7/11/20, 12:58:23 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[7/11/20, 12:58:58 PM] Lore: Me encanta el acento de los niños sudamericanos
[7/11/20, 12:59:15 PM] Lore: Son además más maduros al hablar normalmente
[7/11/20, 12:59:18 PM] Joe: I can’t wait to hear you say, “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida” ahahaha
[7/11/20, 12:59:54 PM] Lore: Si pero eran 6 semanas cuando fuiste y eso fue cuando llegaste a Cali jajjaja
[7/11/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s right.
[7/11/20, 1:00:41 PM] Joe: I probably did the appointment before camp started so that was at least 4 weeks ago

[7/11/20, 3:26:48 PM] Lore: Por ej con rogel no puedo hacer esto
[7/11/20, 3:29:58 PM] Joe: Haha yeah that’s true. She does look like a little human all cuddled up with you like that. With that arm over you and everything hahah
[7/11/20, 3:30:53 PM] Lore: Jajajaj si si es que me encanta
[7/11/20, 3:31:11 PM] Lore: Si ella estuviese contigo seguramente haría lo mismo

[7/11/20, 3:50:41 PM] Lore: Jajajj
[7/11/20, 3:51:42 PM] Lore: Imagínate nosotros viviendo con socks y Kenya juntos. serían perros geniales jajaj
[7/11/20, 4:04:05 PM] Joe: Hahah I would be so tempted to just cuddle with at least one of you all the time 😂
[7/11/20, 4:04:54 PM] Joe: Super unproductive hahaha but soooo great haha
[7/11/20, 4:08:31 PM] Lore: Jajaja espero que me elijas antes que a socks
[7/11/20, 4:11:37 PM] Joe: Whenever that’s an option I choose you every time haha no doubt
[7/11/20, 4:11:51 PM] Lore: Ups, mi hermano y su novia acaban de discutir, ella esta mal, se iba a ir en coche a su casa y finalmente llamó a mí madre y se queda en casa pero no duerme con el 😬

[7/11/20, 4:14:14 PM] Joe: Damn that sucks. Poor brother. It sucks that she tries to leave instead of working it out. Not a great sign haha
[7/11/20, 4:14:44 PM] Joe: 😂
[7/11/20, 4:14:51 PM] Lore: Se fue por qué el la ignoró 🙈
[7/11/20, 4:15:06 PM] Joe: Yessss haha
[7/11/20, 4:15:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha 😆
[7/11/20, 4:16:30 PM] Joe: I mean sometimes people need time before they want to talk about something. But I don’t now the situation so I don’t want to speculate 😂
[7/11/20, 4:16:36 PM] Lore: Mi hermano está ahora trabajando 10hs de socorrista y el acaba cansado, ella es muy hipocondríaca con covid por su padre.. y además ella parece que es celíaca y Gastón supuestamente de vez en cuando le pregunta cómo está, pero no lo suficiente...
[7/11/20, 4:17:16 PM] Lore: Jaja me encanta dando tu opinión si saber, ahí te lo conté igual jjj
[7/11/20, 4:18:07 PM] Joe: Aaah that’s a tough situation. Working hard, being tired, stress from COVID stuff. Not a great combination
[7/11/20, 4:18:31 PM] Lore: Nada buena combinación
[7/11/20, 4:20:00 PM] Lore: Me da pena pq está mal y no come por sus pruebas y estuvo llorando .. y Gastón está abajo en su habitación y no le dice nada 😤
[7/11/20, 4:20:44 PM] Joe: If we have a fight I’ll have to send you messages or write you a letter cause I won’t know how to express myself well enough haha shit
‎[7/11/20, 4:21:51 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/11/20, 4:22:41 PM] Joe: Yeah i guess it sounds like Gastón could do a little more. Or at least seem more concerned? But I’m sure he is tired as well which makes it hard
[7/11/20, 4:23:26 PM] Lore: Jaja no imagino una pelea con vos, aunque discutir no es malo ... Pero si nos pasa en algún momento, sé que lo hablamos y lo resolvemos
[7/11/20, 4:24:52 PM] Lore: Bueno me da esa sensación, además tenés bastante empatía eso es genial de vos siempre te preocupas, entonces te devuelvo eso de la misma manera
[7/11/20, 4:26:17 PM] Lore: El esta cansado de trabajar y dice que no quiere aguantar esas tonterias. Que tiene que parar de ser tan hipocondríaca y estar más alegre .. básicamente esa fue su respuesta cuando mi madre y yo fuimos a hablar con el
[7/11/20, 4:26:30 PM] Joe: I think we would be able to resolve most things for sure haha
[7/11/20, 4:27:20 PM] Joe: 😬😬 yeaah that's tough. Sounds like a response that someone with a lot of stress would give
[7/11/20, 4:28:15 PM] Lore: Eso es bueno querido desconocido jjjj
[7/11/20, 4:28:36 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. Yeah i've noticed you care quite a bit, especially for having never met me 😂

[7/11/20, 11:17:29 PM] Joe: Hahah Kenya is such a sleepy dog. I swear most of the videos you send with Kenya are of her cuddling and sleeping on you 😂
[7/11/20, 11:18:32 PM] Joe: I ended up taking that nap. Now I feel like that meme of the kangaroo I sent you haha. It was supposed to be a 30 minute nap and I slept for 5 hours haha
[7/11/20, 11:20:37 PM] Lore: Jajaja si, luego otra gran parte salimos a pasear.. pero ella ahí se dedica a correr
[7/11/20, 11:21:00 PM] Lore: Nooooo

[7/11/20, 11:24:14 PM] Joe: Hahah now I don’t know what to do. I’m not very tired but i also am supposed to wake up early. I guess I’ll try to go back to sleep in an hour or two.

[7/11/20, 11:25:46 PM] Lore: Jaja es que 5 horas de siesta!!!
[7/11/20, 11:27:26 PM] Lore: Yo creo que no dormí tanto, las mías son microsiestas de 15-20min, 1hr cuando tengo tiempo
[7/11/20, 11:31:14 PM] Joe: Microsiestas hahaha
[7/11/20, 11:32:22 PM] Joe: I didn’t want to sleep for so long! Haha it was an accident.
[7/11/20, 11:32:50 PM] Joe: I had just eaten a bunch of food and it was super hot. I got so sleepy haha. Oh well it happens 🤷‍♂️
[7/11/20, 11:41:08 PM] Lore: Jajaj
‎[7/11/20, 11:43:58 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/11/20, 11:48:32 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s what I felt like.
[7/11/20, 11:49:01 PM] Joe: I actually slept on the floor cause it was too hot in my bed. I didn’t think I’d be asleep for so long so sleeping on the floor seemed like a good idea.
[7/11/20, 11:54:37 PM] Lore: Jajajaja
[7/11/20, 11:55:29 PM] Lore: En el suelo sin nada o con alguna esterilla?
[7/11/20, 11:57:18 PM] Joe: The floor was carpet but I was laying on a towel. Pretty comfortable actually
[7/11/20, 11:57:34 PM] Joe: Maybe a little too comfortable apparently 😆
[7/12/20, 12:07:28 AM] Lore: 🤭😂 me hubiese gustado pasar por ahí y verte ahí en el suelo jaja
[7/12/20, 12:08:53 AM] Lore: Es verdad ahí tienen moqueta, acá no se usa casi.. las casas tienen pequeñas alfombras pero moqueta nadie
[7/12/20, 12:11:28 AM] Joe: Interesting. I didn’t realize having a lot of carpet is kind of an American thing. Americans must be a strange bunch to the rest of the world haha
[7/12/20, 12:19:46 AM] Lore: Jajaja
[7/12/20, 12:22:10 AM] Lore: Se puede usar en alguna zona muy fría como países escandinavos, pero eso es común de ustedes. A mí me encanta ir descalza, sería genial pisar en moqueta jj .. pero no me imagino, no poder barrer bien o limpiar el suelo con fregona con olor a fregasuelos
[7/12/20, 12:29:50 AM] Joe: Now i am just wondering what other things seem common to me but are actually not super common haha. Like how we have mostly automatic gears in our cars. I didn’t realize automatics are less common in other places
[7/12/20, 12:31:30 AM] Joe: We’re actually taking out a lot of the carpet and putting in hardwood floors. Carpet is nice but it is difficult to keep it looking nice for years
[7/12/20, 12:32:15 AM] Lore: Joe en su burbuja jajaja
[7/12/20, 12:33:05 AM] Lore: Me autorizas a que te envié fotos? Voy al campo con las perras

[7/12/20, 2:52:26 PM] Lore: Jajaja hoy al final lo vas a conducir?
[7/12/20, 2:54:41 PM] Joe: This is a different car haha we got to drive the other one already but we didn’t get to do much drifting. It was already getting dark when we got to the spot that day we fixed it. Now he is trying to get this one ready for an event on Wednesday
[7/12/20, 3:00:47 PM] Lore: Ajjhh
[7/12/20, 3:00:51 PM] Lore: Ahhh

[7/12/20, 3:04:34 PM] Joe: I always tell him that he should just have 1 nice car instead of 3 or 4 shitty ones

[7/12/20, 3:10:28 PM] Joe: Super random....some lady came by the skatepark with a hella big dog. A Tibetan mastiff. She said it didn’t like Chinese people. I thought that was weird haha. But it was so fluffy. I wish I would’ve taken a picture
[7/12/20, 3:14:38 PM] Lore: Jaja tiene sentido!
[7/12/20, 3:15:08 PM] Lore: Que te pasó en el pie Homeless?

[7/12/20, 3:16:25 PM] Joe: My board hit my leg super hard. I didn’t think it was very bad but it’s been a few hours and it still hurts so i decided to ice it
[7/12/20, 3:17:03 PM] Lore: Ohhh pobrecito
[7/12/20, 3:19:42 PM] Joe: Well she explained that he dog doesn’t like people that are afraid of it.
[7/12/20, 3:20:26 PM] Joe: I asked one of my friends and he said that dog is like a guard dog in China often. It’s seen as an aggressive breed to many, like how Americans see pit bulls as aggressive.
[7/12/20, 3:21:29 PM] Joe: But, she hella pulled the dog away when my Asian homie came up even though he wasn’t afraid of the dog haha so that made me question that lady and how she is training the dog
‎[7/12/20, 3:22:02 PM] Lore: ‎image omitted
[7/12/20, 3:23:26 PM] Lore: Que zorra
[7/12/20, 3:24:17 PM] Joe: Woooah! It wasn’t as big as that huge one but it was just as fluffy looking
[7/12/20, 3:24:42 PM] Joe: Actually it was probably pretty close in size to that dog. Just a tiny bit smaller
[7/12/20, 3:25:13 PM] Lore: Que lindo poder abrazarlo jaja
[7/12/20, 3:27:01 PM] Joe: He had a big giant eye booger hahah but he was cool. The owner was surprised he liked me and had to take a picture for the trainer 😂
[7/12/20, 10:55:59 PM] Lore: Perdón me quedé súper dormida, con la luz encendida y sin la alarma puesta 🙈. Menos mal que me desperté sola con la luz natural, porque tengo que ir a trabajar ... grrr estoy re cansada 😫

[7/15/20, 7:30:44 AM] Joe: Ah ok. Dude I was having way too much fun playing with my friends kid haha. And then my other friend brought his kids too.
[7/15/20, 7:31:14 AM] Joe: This is probably weird for me to say but I was hella wanting my own little baby yesterday 😂
[7/15/20, 7:32:00 AM] Lore: Jajajaja
‎[7/15/20, 7:32:56 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/15/20, 7:33:32 AM] Lore: JajajA yo te puedo dar uno! 😂
[7/15/20, 7:33:51 AM] Joe: 😂 😂
[7/15/20, 7:33:52 AM] Lore: Esa niña que me mostraste en el video era para comérsela!!
[7/15/20, 7:34:12 AM] Lore: Te salió el instinto paternal
[7/15/20, 7:34:39 AM] Lore: Me hubiese gustado presenciar eso jajaj
[7/15/20, 7:34:56 AM] Joe: 🙊hahahah
[7/15/20, 7:35:27 AM] Joe: Ugh she is soooo cute! I was pushing her on the swing for hella long having way too much fun haha
[7/15/20, 7:36:38 AM] Joe: The funny thing is, my friends that have kids are the super irresponsible friends haha. The friends that we guessed would’ve been the last to have kids had kids first haha
[7/15/20, 7:37:40 AM] Joe: I don’t want to take care of everyone else’s kids haha I want to make my own kids cool
[7/15/20, 7:37:52 AM] Lore: Oooiins que dulce
[7/15/20, 7:38:14 AM] Lore: Si suele pasar, entre alguna de mis amigas también jaja
[7/15/20, 7:39:48 AM] Lore: tus amigos tendrán ternura al verte jugar tanto con sus hijos jaja
[7/15/20, 7:41:19 AM] Lore: Ohh jaja no es muy normal escuchar eso en chicos de mi edad
[7/15/20, 7:41:30 AM] Joe: I guess it makes sense. They had the kids on accident which matches their irresponsible personalities hahaa
‎[7/15/20, 7:42:32 AM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/15/20, 7:44:12 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I thought it would be weird to tell you but that’s what I’ve been feeling lately. Probably from just being around kids so much and trying to help them learn.
[7/15/20, 7:45:18 AM] Lore: 💚
[7/15/20, 7:45:39 AM] Joe: I don’t know. Am I supposed to want other things at this age? I feel like I want to be a dad 😂

[7/15/20, 7:48:43 AM] Lore: Jajaja si no sé, no es muy normal escucharlo con esta edad.. también igual es porque estoy acostumbrada que en España se tienen los hijos super tarde
[7/15/20, 7:49:13 AM] Lore: Creo que en USA es más común hijos más jóvenes, casarse, etc
[7/15/20, 7:50:11 AM] Lore: Tendrías hijos igual o adoptarias como padre soltero?
[7/15/20, 7:50:42 AM] Joe: Haha that makes sense. What would you say is a typical age to have kids in Spain?
[7/15/20, 7:51:42 AM] Lore: Mmm depende.. igual 35..38.. tarde jajaja
[7/15/20, 7:52:06 AM] Lore: En Uruguay suele ser antes
[7/15/20, 7:52:28 AM] Joe: Hmmm I don’t know if I would adopt. Maybe if that was my only option haha I wouldn’t be totally against it. If I knew I’d never have a kid I’d probably adopt at that point
[7/15/20, 7:53:05 AM] Joe: Damn that’s pretty late haha. Everyone in Spain has old ass parents 😆
[7/15/20, 7:53:35 AM] Lore: Jaja te gustaría que sea tuyo entonces? Más que adoptado no?
[7/15/20, 7:54:21 AM] Joe: Haha yeah it would be my preference to have my own. Little mini me hahaha
[7/15/20, 7:54:28 AM] Lore: Hay gente joven también que los tiene, pero por accidente, porque lleva mucho con pareja o cosas así
[7/15/20, 7:54:55 AM] Lore: Jjjj Mini Joe 😍
[7/15/20, 7:55:54 AM] Joe: My friend’s son looks hella like me. Super similar hair and everything. Seeing that little dude hella makes me want my own little dude haha
[7/15/20, 7:56:51 AM] Lore: Jajaj cuál? No lo vi a ese
[7/15/20, 7:58:03 AM] Joe: They came after it got dark. I sent a Instagram post with his kids
[7/15/20, 8:00:05 AM] Lore: Jajaj un mini rulitos
[7/15/20, 8:01:31 AM] Joe: I want a little one 😩
[7/15/20, 8:02:02 AM] Joe: Ok ok I’m sorry enough of that. I’ll get over it hahaha. Alright babe I have to go to work now. I hope you have a wonderful day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘

[7/15/20, 8:07:30 AM] Lore: okey papiiii, que ese café te haga efecto, que tengas un buen día de trabajo, yo me voy a dormir una microsiesta.Muuak 😘
[7/15/20, 11:52:55 AM] Lore: Cómo vasss?
[7/15/20, 12:00:16 PM] Joe: It’s going well. Just waiting for the last 2 kids to get picked up and I can get some lunch before starting the private lesson
[7/15/20, 12:05:36 PM] Lore: Genial!
[7/15/20, 12:13:53 PM] Joe: The private lesson wasn’t actually that bad. The kids were better behaved compared to when they were at camp. I think it’s because the park had a lot of adults skating so they weren’t as comfortable.
[7/15/20, 12:16:25 PM] Lore: Mmm
[7/15/20, 12:16:48 PM] Lore: Aún no la empezaste la clase privada
[7/15/20, 12:16:54 PM] Lore: O si?
[7/15/20, 12:18:07 PM] Lore: Sea como sea, me alegro que hayas podido ver pq se sienten incómodos profe ☺️
[7/15/20, 12:19:07 PM] Joe: The private lesson for today starts at 1. Yesterday’s lesson went well
[7/15/20, 12:20:26 PM] Lore: 👌
[7/15/20, 12:21:00 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s not so bad. We’ll see how many weeks I continue doing these lessons for. I have some other people trying to get lessons too. Going to start a bidding war haha
‎[7/15/20, 12:22:49 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/15/20, 12:24:03 PM] Joe: Actually I’ve been thinking I need to increase my prices for private lessons. I have a friend that does them and he charges almost twice what I charge haha
[7/15/20, 12:25:49 PM] Lore: Cuánto cobrabas? 30-40 dol la hora, o así no?
[7/15/20, 12:28:12 PM] Joe: Yeah I charge about that much. $30-40 per hour. But my friend charges $60+ per hour and has no trouble getting lessons
[7/15/20, 12:29:46 PM] Lore: Wow! 60 dol la hora
[7/15/20, 12:30:06 PM] Lore: Pero a niños también? El es muy muy bueno?
[7/15/20, 12:30:53 PM] Lore: Me refiero, que diferencia tanto el precio?
[7/15/20, 12:31:02 PM] Joe: Yeah he also teaches children. He is probably about the same level of skating as me.
[7/15/20, 12:31:31 PM] Joe: Nothing. He just asked for that much. Parents have a lot of money around here haha
[7/15/20, 12:31:48 PM] Joe: Have you seen Orange Is The New Black on Netflix?
[7/15/20, 12:32:01 PM] Lore: Vaya pijos que son en bay area jaja
[7/15/20, 12:32:22 PM] Lore: Pues ya sabes bombón, a subir esa tarifa!!!
[7/15/20, 12:32:32 PM] Joe: One of the kids that I’m giving private lessons to said his mom wrote the book and sold it to Netflix. So I’m assuming his mom is the main character and also very rich hahaa
[7/15/20, 12:33:05 PM] Lore: Siii la vi jajaj
[7/15/20, 12:33:16 PM] Lore: Aunque la última temporada ya no, era muy repetitivo
[7/15/20, 12:33:33 PM] Joe: Oh yeah for sure haha. I’m getting $70 hour but I have to watch 2 kids haha. That should be the price for just 1
[7/15/20, 12:34:15 PM] Lore: Bueno.. también podés hacer precio cuando van 2
[7/15/20, 12:35:09 PM] Lore: Jaja sí es así, es bastante rica si..
[7/15/20, 12:35:48 PM] Lore: Podés cobrar 60 dol la hora y 50dol si van dos
[7/15/20, 12:38:18 PM] Lore: O 70 y 60
[7/15/20, 12:39:12 PM] Joe: I think 60 and 50 for two is probably reasonable.
[7/15/20, 12:39:20 PM] Lore: Si la gente ahí tiene dinero.. aprovecha.. pensarán que cuanto más caro es mejor
[7/15/20, 12:39:49 PM] Lore: Si.. más que nada pq si no es mucha diferencia de tus 30-49 a más de 60
[7/15/20, 12:39:59 PM] Lore: Así te aseguras
[7/15/20, 12:40:37 PM] Joe: That’s probably true. I know one guy that would charge $100 per hour. He was really good instructor but very expensive
[7/15/20, 12:41:26 PM] Lore: Uf es demasiado 100!!
‎[7/15/20, 12:41:28 PM] Lore: ‎video omitted
[7/15/20, 12:42:37 PM] Lore: Y menos para niños que tampoco hacen demasiado.. si fuese algo más técnico.. está más justificado, no? Bueno.. no sé.. jaja
[7/15/20, 12:45:48 PM] Joe: I guess it depends on the goal. If the parents basically want a babysitter $100 is too much. But if they’re actually trying to get their kid to the next level and progress it’s not super unreasonable. It doesn’t take a crazy amount of hours to get a lot of improvement so it seems worth it.
[7/15/20, 12:46:55 PM] Joe: The parents of these kids seem like they want a babysitter and it’s just a bonus that I can skate with the kids while doing it haha.

[7/16/20, 6:41:18 AM] Joe: Buenos días!
[7/16/20, 6:42:19 AM] Joe: The mountains are such a constant feature in the background here that I sometimes don’t even notice them anymore. But when I go somewhere without mountains i definitely notice they’re missing haha

[7/16/20, 12:14:45 PM] Joe: Hahaha we didn’t skate for the whole last hour. Just learned Spanish 😂
[7/16/20, 12:15:28 PM] Joe: Yeah those two kids are not so bad.
[7/16/20, 12:16:26 PM] Joe: Time for a short break before the lessons start. I’m getting tired.
[7/16/20, 12:19:03 PM] Lore: Jajaja muy buena idea! Tenemos que practicar un poco nosotros también
[7/16/20, 12:20:02 PM] Lore: Yo tuve el día libre hoy, ayer por la noche fui a la sierra fue el cumple de mi padre, y ahora llegué a casa, tranquilamente descansando, veré algo en Netflix

[7/16/20, 12:29:19 PM] Joe: Glad you had a nice day off. Enjoy your Netflix 😊

[7/16/20, 1:55:50 PM] Joe: I was going to say it looks like a fishing hat haha
[7/16/20, 2:01:14 PM] Lore: Candy barrita energética? Jj Ese niño tan pequeño se come las uñas mmm 🤔
[7/16/20, 2:01:27 PM] Lore: Te puedo prestar mi sombrero! Jajaj

[7/16/20, 2:29:56 PM] Lore: Uf jaja que cosa más rara, no me gusta es muy tétrica jajaja pero es interesante
[7/16/20, 2:31:55 PM] Lore: Se habrá inspirado en iglesias por los laterales de la casa..pero esas ventanas rotadas y la combinación de revestimientos 🙈
[7/16/20, 2:45:23 PM] Joe: Damn I never use sunscreen haha I should
[7/16/20, 2:48:33 PM] Joe: Hahah very nice. As long as it protect you from the sun that’s most important.
[7/16/20, 3:08:42 PM] Joe: I’m finally free! No lessons after work tomorrow so it’ll be an easy short day
[7/16/20, 3:21:47 PM] Lore: Por algo se te quedó la cara como tomate jajaja.. usalo 🙏 luego salen granitos, manchas.. despigmentación como mínimo
[7/16/20, 3:22:20 PM] Lore: 👌👌
[7/16/20, 3:26:40 PM] Joe: Shit I’m going to be an ugly old man 👴🏽
[7/16/20, 3:26:49 PM] Joe: I better get some sunscreen hahaha
[7/16/20, 3:36:33 PM] Lore: jaja me acabo de dar una ducha fresca y me voy a dormir que mañana madrugo y salgo super pronto del trabajo. Un besitoo 😘

[7/16/20, 10:21:37 PM] Lore: De camino al trabajo, no hay casi nadie a esta hora en la calle, debería levantarme algún día más pronto y salir a caminar
[7/16/20, 10:23:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you should definitely do that some day haha. I love going out when there is very few people out. It’s especially interesting in bigger cities that you usually see very full. Completely different vibe haha
[7/16/20, 10:25:59 PM] Lore: Síii, otra energía.. además veo cosas que normalmente no veo jajaja
[7/16/20, 10:28:30 PM] Lore: Canarias

[7/16/20, 10:28:37 PM] Joe: Haha that’s also true. Well I hope you have a good day at work. You’ll probably be getting off around the time I wake up 🙄
[7/16/20, 10:29:22 PM] Joe: hahaha Is this where we meet?
[7/16/20, 10:29:49 PM] Lore: Si voy de camino aún, hoy salgo a las 13:00 hs
[7/16/20, 10:30:00 PM] Lore: Vos estarás re dormido jaja
[7/16/20, 10:30:23 PM] Lore: Es donde iremos si venís y donde yo creo que viviré una temporada en algún momento jajaja
[7/16/20, 10:32:41 PM] Joe: Sounds like a plan haha I’d be super stoked to get back to island life haha 🌴
[7/16/20, 10:34:12 PM] Joe: It would be great if my passport would show up. And if they would open up travel 😑

I’m ready to go!
[7/16/20, 10:39:36 PM] Lore: Sii ademas mucha gente ahí habla en inglés no tendrías problema jaja
[7/16/20, 10:39:37 PM] Lore: Cómo está la cosa por ahí? Me habías dicho que habían cerrado varios establecimientos..
[7/16/20, 10:41:32 PM] Joe: A lot of people knowing English would be great. I still need to know my spanish for you though haha most important.
[7/16/20, 10:42:35 PM] Joe: Oh yeah things are closing again in some states. Cases are going up. They’re considering whether or not to open schools after summer.
[7/16/20, 10:43:46 PM] Joe: I think in the city I work they decided they’ll do 8 weeks of online classes at least to start the school year.
‎[7/16/20, 10:49:43 PM] Lore: ‎GIF omitted
[7/16/20, 10:50:41 PM] Lore: Ufff acá también! Hay zonas en otras comunidades autónomas que cerraron por nuevos casos. Las clases acá empiezan en septiembre y las están preparando para que sean online también
[7/16/20, 10:51:17 PM] Lore: Que difícil es volver al mundo de antes 🙃
[7/16/20, 10:52:38 PM] Joe: Shiiiiit
[7/16/20, 10:54:00 PM] Joe: For real! Fuck. This is some ridiculous shit. If I was just “allowed” to go, I’d be there so soon.

[7/16/20, 10:59:00 PM] Joe: I appreciate it. I’m still going. I still tell people I’m trying to get to Spain when they ask when I’m going back to Hawaii haha
[7/16/20, 11:00:12 PM] Lore: Jajja no no Hawaii no
[7/16/20, 11:00:13 PM] Lore: Ademasss ya lo conoces
[7/16/20, 11:00:13 PM] Lore: España aún no, además podés tener muy buena compañía (yo) y aprender un idioma jajaja
[7/16/20, 11:00:17 PM] Joe: I know you said you won’t stop talking to me...but if for some reason this went on for years and you actually did stop talking to me, I’d still go to Spain the first chance I get hahaa. I can’t not go
[7/16/20, 11:01:01 PM] Lore: Years????????
[7/16/20, 11:01:10 PM] Joe: No I’m not going back to Hawaii. I’m going to you haha.

[7/16/20, 11:02:13 PM] Lore: Jajaj exagerado!!!!
[7/16/20, 11:02:47 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m just saying. I’m going to Spain no matter what. I need to go at this point 😆

[7/16/20, 11:04:40 PM] Joe: Haha well besides seeing you, which is what I really want...I’ve also grown super fond of the idea of going to a country and learning more spanish. But like you said, it would be good for me to learn with you 😊
[7/16/20, 11:04:50 PM] Lore: Me planto ahí en California jajaj
[7/16/20, 11:06:20 PM] Joe: Yesss haha you should definitely do that. We’ll see who can get to the other fastest. Though I’m pretty sure I’ll win this race haha

[7/16/20, 11:14:45 PM] Joe: I’ll try to keep things exciting for you hahah
[7/16/20, 11:15:21 PM] Joe: What is “huequitos” I know it’s the diminutive of something but 🤷‍♂️
[7/16/20, 11:22:18 PM] Joe: Alright you tell me what huequitos is when you can. I’m going to fall asleep any second haha have a great day, I’ll talk to you soon! Buenas noches 😘

[7/17/20, 4:20:51 AM] Lore: Perdona que no te respondí estaba justo hablando con unas compañeras
[7/17/20, 4:21:27 AM] Lore: Jijiji huequitos es un diminutivo. Correcto!
[7/17/20, 4:22:27 AM] Lore: Hueco .. sería como una manera de decir a tener tiempo.. "sacar un hueco".. sacar un momento..un tiempo... Etc

[7/17/20, 4:26:31 AM] Lore: Hueco de pozo, hueco de donut, hueco.. etc jjjj
[7/17/20, 6:34:33 AM] Joe: Niiice. But do you wish to start early too haha?
[7/17/20, 6:35:15 AM] Joe: All gooood. I went to sleep soon after messaging you
[7/17/20, 6:36:07 AM] Joe: Hahah ok I understand hueco now 😂 thank you. I have to get up and take a shower now.
[7/17/20, 7:12:40 AM] Lore: Holi, estaba durmiendo una siiesstaaa jaja 😁
[7/17/20, 7:14:49 AM] Lore: Mmm jaja algún día no me importaría, pero hay días que entro a las 9 .. y está bien pq salgo a las 2, llego a casa a las 3 menos cuarto, cocino, como, tranquuii
[7/17/20, 7:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess getting off early is pretty great. I used to always close when I was a pharmacy tech and sometimes I forget how much I hated it. I could never really do stuff after work cause I got off too late
[7/17/20, 7:28:05 AM] Lore: Fuck the pharmacy, no more!!
[7/17/20, 7:33:15 AM] Joe: Hahah true! Never again 😂

[7/17/20, 7:57:17 AM] Lore: Ay me suena a chino

[7/17/20, 7:59:14 AM] Joe: Oh yeah haha Celsius not Fahrenheit
[7/17/20, 8:00:02 AM] Joe: Haha thank babe. I’m just about to leave now so I appreciate the reminder. I’ll put some on and grab a hat 😊

[7/17/20, 12:37:50 PM] Lore: Hoy dormí dos siestas y en una de ellas, soñé con vos
[7/17/20, 12:39:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha this is what today felt like. Some of the kids are so much work 😂
[7/17/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Especially if they decide you’re the “fun” counselor haha cause then they follow you around all day. They say my name so often hahaha it’s like my name being yelled is a constant background sound all day long haha
[7/17/20, 12:42:13 PM] Joe: Hahah sweet! I made it into your dream 😆 I hope it was a good dream haha
[7/17/20, 12:43:07 PM] Lore: 😂😂😂😂
[7/17/20, 12:43:26 PM] Lore: Me parece que el instinto paternal se te esta yendo
[7/17/20, 12:44:42 PM] Joe: Hahah I just want my own kid to annoy me. Not like 10 kids that aren’t mine all at once 😂
[7/17/20, 12:45:28 PM] Lore: Si no me acuerdo mucho, solo que estábamos en un sitio pero no sé dónde era, estábamos prestando atención a algo que nos estaban explicando, pero nos estábamos haciendo caricias en la mano sin que se den cuenta, solo recuerdo eso, jajaja pero era genial,tocar algo real jaja ...
[7/17/20, 12:45:52 PM] Lore: Suena tan cursi cuando lo digo jaja

[7/17/20, 2:33:20 PM] Lore: Eyy estaba cenando con las chicas
[7/17/20, 2:35:23 PM] Lore: Para mí fue super bueno, es como que ya no estaba inquieta, ya estabas ahí tocándome la mano jajaj 🤷
[7/17/20, 2:36:16 PM] Lore: Jajajajaja
[7/17/20, 2:37:10 PM] Lore: Que suerte la que pueda tocarte ahora!!
[7/17/20, 2:43:11 PM] Joe: Aaaah I need another dream with you in it haha
[7/17/20, 2:43:34 PM] Joe: I’m over at Kyle’s now. I just got here not too long ago.

[7/17/20, 2:48:50 PM] Lore: Socks te ignora
[7/17/20, 2:49:06 PM] Lore: 🙊😅
[7/17/20, 2:50:38 PM] Joe: She doesn’t love me anymore haha what a bummer
[7/17/20, 2:51:53 PM] Lore: Hoy hice 3D con Sandri cuando nos levantamos de la siesta! Al principio fue súper frustrante, no salía lo que queríamos hacer, hoy estuve yo con el ordenador, y no me levanté de la silla hasta que salió lo que necesitábamos!
[7/17/20, 2:53:36 PM] Lore: Sandra empezó a comer cacahuetes compulsivamente jajaja pero finalmente logramos lo que queríamos, me encanta cuando esto pasa.. dimos un montón de vueltas, con lo que aprendimos y cada una ponía su manera de hacerlo.. muchas veces no funcionaba jaja
[7/17/20, 2:57:13 PM] Lore: Seguro que si, debe tener calor. Te protege estando cerca en tus pies jjj
[7/17/20, 3:00:10 PM] Joe: Damn learning the 3D stuff with someone sounds way better than learning alone. I wish I had a friend to learn how to code with.  It would’ve helped a lot.
[7/17/20, 3:00:24 PM] Joe: That’s really good though. I’m glad you stuck it out until you got it done haha
[7/17/20, 3:00:45 PM] Joe: Yeah I’ll just pretend she is protecting me, not ignoring me 😂
[7/17/20, 3:03:19 PM] Lore: Jajaja si es genial, nos entró un ataque de risa al final .. además habíamos tomado el tinto de verano y yo ya me estaba quedando ciega, Sandra se empezó a reír pq yo no conseguía eliminar una geometría, se quedaba bloqueada jaja
[7/17/20, 3:04:32 PM] Lore: Jajja ella mueve las orejitas sutilmente pero ni te mira 😂
[7/17/20, 3:05:47 PM] Lore: Más video 👀

[7/17/20, 3:11:14 PM] Lore: Bombón cómo te cae una lágrima, estás cansadísimo!!
[7/17/20, 3:12:00 PM] Joe: The little one wants attention because socks was getting attention haha
[7/17/20, 3:12:43 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I am. I told you I’m tired 😂 the day wasn’t even long but it sure felt like it was
[7/17/20, 3:13:27 PM] Lore: Jajaja estás cansado y fumaste verdad?
[7/17/20, 3:14:21 PM] Joe: Ahaha a little bit. I also just ate a big bowl of pho. It was hella good but now I’m stuffed
