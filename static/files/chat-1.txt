"
1,"[4/24/20, 10:23:57 AM] Joe: Haha I told you I was downloading it!

3,"[4/24/20, 10:26:18 AM] Joe: Yeah I don’t know why I can’t just stay asleep 😴
"
4,"[4/24/20, 10:29:07 AM] Joe: Si
"
5,"[4/24/20, 10:29:56 AM] Joe: Might as well get out since I couldn’t sleep I guess
"
6,"[4/24/20, 10:36:49 AM] Joe: I wake up with the sun no matter where I am hahaha
"
7,"[4/24/20, 11:09:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeah super close to the beach haha. I have to drive nicest beaches but there are some decent small beaches I can walk or skate to.
"
8,"[4/24/20, 11:09:37 AM] Joe: The town is called Kailua-Kona
"
9,"[4/24/20, 11:47:54 AM] Joe: Thanks! Before quarantine I was skating to the beach everyday and I was loving it. Definitely need a beach near by wherever I end up.
"
10,"[4/24/20, 11:49:52 AM] Joe: Haha yeah Kailua is kind of a tourist town but it’s cool and really mellow compared to Honolulu
"
11,"[4/24/20, 12:13:57 PM] Joe: I can’t skate into town where all the good skate spots are now and I can’t skate to the good beaches either but it’s ok to skate down the road. Skating the road is fine for exercise but I want to actually skate fun spots 😂
"
12,"[4/24/20, 12:15:58 PM] Joe: I’ve never been to Honolulu but I doubt I would like it haha. Too many humans and it’s like a fake Hawaii. 
"
13,"[4/24/20, 12:46:10 PM] Joe: There isn’t much near me but the main road and some hotels. The fun places are just random spots downtown. Ledges, benches, rails, & stairs but they’re all in an area we’re not supposed to be.
"
14,"[4/24/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: I’d love to show it to you anytime ☺️
"
15,"[4/24/20, 1:25:44 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
16,"[4/24/20, 1:30:39 PM] Joe: So what time do you normally get up in the mornings(when you don’t have to do your course)? Do you like to sleep in?
"
17,"[4/24/20, 1:59:54 PM] Joe: eso está bien, enviar todos los gifs jaja no se detienen
"
18,"[4/24/20, 2:03:51 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I might stay in bed longer if I had a reason to hahaha

21,"[4/24/20, 3:11:01 PM] Joe: I don’t know who it was hahaha I must look like I smoke 😂 💨
"
22,"[4/24/20, 3:18:06 PM] Joe: It was free! They just gave it to me. It was weird but I’ll take it haha
"
23,"[4/24/20, 3:19:05 PM] Joe: Muchas gracias 🙏🏽
"
24,"[4/24/20, 3:19:19 PM] Joe: Yeah 🤷🏽‍♂️
"
25,"[4/24/20, 3:19:26 PM] Joe: People are nice out here haha
"
26,"[4/24/20, 3:19:57 PM] Joe: It was an older couple driving by in their car 🚗
"
27,"[4/24/20, 3:22:22 PM] Joe: Am I going to get murdered?? 😱
"
28,"[4/24/20, 3:23:24 PM] Joe: Cause to strangers on the internet and taking weed from old people seems like a good way to get murdered hahahaha I better shape up
"
29,"[4/24/20, 3:23:52 PM] Joe: Cause talking to strangers*
"
30,"[4/24/20, 3:37:06 PM] Joe: Hahaha alright maybe I’ll put the weed away but you’ll have to try harder to scare me off 🥱
"
31,"[4/24/20, 3:47:28 PM] Joe: I buy from my family so they can’t catch me haha 🚔
"
32,"[4/24/20, 3:47:57 PM] Joe: I’ll try my best to stay out of jail. I’ve done pretty good at that so far haha
"
33,"[4/24/20, 4:07:34 PM] Joe: 😂
"
34,"[4/24/20, 4:08:28 PM] Joe: I want to ask you, what do you usually like to do for fun? What keeps you entertained?
"
35,"[4/24/20, 4:30:22 PM] Joe: Nice nice. I like that you’re creative and that you love the outdoors so much. That’s really cool. Yoga is ok, I took a class once, it was a little harder than I though it would be but I was enjoying it by the end of the class.
"
36,"[4/24/20, 4:54:33 PM] Joe: Haha you look like you’re fun to hang out with. Always with a drink near by 🍹
"
37,"[4/24/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha the dogs are posing so good 😂
"
38,"[4/24/20, 5:02:11 PM] Joe: Haha what!? Is that weird? I hope you know what I meant 😆
"
39,"[4/24/20, 5:05:53 PM] Joe: So many dogs! I love dogs but I don’t have any. I used to when I was growing up though.
"
40,"[4/24/20, 5:07:00 PM] Joe: 🤔 what would I say then?
"
41,"[4/24/20, 5:08:10 PM] Joe: I love the photos!
"
42,"[4/24/20, 5:15:18 PM] Joe: I would send you some photos too but everything I have is just videos of me skateboarding or pictures of nature hahaha

"
50,"[4/24/20, 5:40:17 PM] Joe: I was working hard that day 😓 haha
"
51,"[4/24/20, 5:48:59 PM] Joe: Haha I’ll have to take more photos or videos just for you cause I don’t take them very often 😅 I’m camera shy
"
52,"[4/24/20, 5:49:34 PM] Joe: Or just all around shy now that I think about it lol
"
53,"[4/25/20, 12:44:13 AM] Joe: Buenos días!
"
54,"[4/25/20, 12:44:34 AM] Joe: Yeah I figured you fell asleep. It was getting late there haha
"
55,"[4/25/20, 12:48:26 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s funny. I don’t know why I’m like this 😅
"
56,"[4/25/20, 12:49:56 AM] Joe: How’s it looking over there today? Another beautiful day in quarantine?
"
57,"[4/25/20, 12:59:38 AM] Joe: Well it’s a good thing you’re the opposite! You’re very outgoing and you seem to know what you like, even if it’s on the other side of the world hahaha
"
58,"[4/25/20, 1:01:08 AM] Joe: Feel free to send video if you decide to dance 💃 😝
"
59,"[4/25/20, 1:10:16 AM] Joe: Hahahaha I would LOVE to see that someday!! 😂 😂 😂
"
60,"[4/25/20, 1:11:56 AM] Joe: As long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters. I would find it very cute to see you laughing and dancing. I like that energy haha
"
61,"[4/25/20, 1:25:31 AM] Joe: Hmmm I like to program on my computer, I spend a lot of time learning about companies/business because I like to buy stocks haha, I like carnivorous plants like the one in my story from yesterday, outdoor stuff like swimming or hiking.
"
62,"[4/25/20, 1:28:54 AM] Joe: I’m not the most exciting person I suppose 🤔 but hey, I am what I am 🤷‍♂️
"
63,"[4/25/20, 1:46:47 AM] Joe: But yeah my most favorite thing to do is skating with my friends. 
"
64,"[4/25/20, 1:49:13 AM] Joe: Haha ok good
"
65,"[4/25/20, 1:50:17 AM] Joe: Oh and I’m way at the end of that video haha. But it gives a vibe of what we’re like I think. It was so fun to make. We’re working on another one now.
"
66,"[4/25/20, 1:53:27 AM] Joe: Hahahahaha shit!
"
67,"[4/25/20, 1:59:24 AM] Joe: Hahah muchas gracias! I should not have sent you that video lmao hopefully there isn’t anything else embarrassing in there I don’t remember. I don’t think there is much though haha. It’s super long. And you’ll probably notice when my part starts they put my name as Hone. That’s what my friends called me.
"
68,"[4/25/20, 2:07:41 AM] Joe: Hahahaha 🐻
"
69,"[4/25/20, 2:09:03 AM] Joe: Here is more of us being stupid on the internet. Might as well let you find anything embarrassing of me that’s out there now hahahaha 
"
70,"[4/25/20, 2:19:23 AM] Joe: Hahaha! ☺️ thank you thank you. I think I’ve sent you all the video on the internet of me doing weird stuff. Glad to get that out of the way 🤣
"
71,"[4/25/20, 2:26:11 AM] Joe: Thanks, style is important to skaters so that’s good you can notice haha🕺
"
72,"[4/25/20, 2:48:22 AM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 fuuuuck that is Vince hahaha thats my dude! He definitely makes things more exciting and fun. He just had his first kid recently though so he is taking it down a notch 😆
"
73,"[4/25/20, 3:10:11 AM] Joe: I think I’m going to try that mystery weed from the old hippies. Wish me luck haha
"
74,"[4/25/20, 3:12:41 AM] Joe: He’s 28. I definitely didn’t expect him to have a kid but he’s a cool dude and he’s doing a good job being a dad or whatever haha. His daughter is a super cool and happy little kid. I love to see that haha
"
75,"[4/25/20, 3:22:18 AM] Joe: Yeah kids are great. That’s one reason I really enjoy my job at the skatepark. We do those summer camps and working with the kids is really fun. They can be little jerks sometimes hahaha but for the most part kids I like children. How about you?
"
76,"[4/25/20, 3:29:34 AM] Joe: It’s true! Some of them seem like they just want to make you mad 😡 they think it’s hilarious or they want attention. Their games don’t work on me though, by the end of the week I usually have them on my side haha.

"
79,"[4/25/20, 3:38:37 AM] Joe: Dude, I did have one kid last summer that was sooooo difficult though and I just couldn’t get him to do anything! The worst part was that he was at camp more weeks than any other kid! He really pushed my buttons hahaha that little mother fucker
"
80,"[4/25/20, 3:47:10 AM] Joe: Hahahaha it’s a saying. Like he got on my nerves or he annoyed me on purpose
"
81,"[4/25/20, 3:50:44 AM] Joe: Hahah shit
"
82,"[4/25/20, 3:53:06 AM] Joe: Hmmm that’s closer “don’t bust my balls”. Similar meaning though. “Don’t push my buttons”, I thought that was common haha
"
83,"[4/25/20, 4:01:14 AM] Joe: Exactly. Hopefully I don’t push your buttons though hahaha at least not yet

"
87,"[4/25/20, 4:05:52 AM] Joe: Aaaahhhhh
"
88,"[4/25/20, 4:05:56 AM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
89,"[4/25/20, 4:06:06 AM] Joe: 🤭
"
90,"[4/25/20, 4:31:37 AM] Joe: Hahaha alright let me see...do you have a music app or I can send them from YouTube?
"
91,"[4/25/20, 4:34:19 AM] Joe: Hmm ok. What kind of mood do you want? 😆 
"
92,"[4/25/20, 4:39:02 AM] Joe: I like the music they play out here on the island 🌴 and mostly mellow stuff but I like a lot of different stuff. Depends on my mood haha
"
93,"[4/25/20, 4:39:22 AM] Joe: 🙈
"
94,"[4/25/20, 4:40:22 AM] Joe: J. Boog
"
95,"[4/25/20, 4:41:32 AM] Joe: Haha this is going to be my song for the next skate video https://youtu.be/itZe1pgsxag
"
96,"[4/25/20, 4:43:20 AM] Joe: https://youtu.be/-knXBsbZRJA
"
97,"[4/25/20, 4:44:21 AM] Joe: And it really depends on my mood because I could send you something super upbeat and danceable or some mopey sad boy shit Hahahaha. Please don’t judge me too much 🙏🏽 😊
"
98,"[4/25/20, 4:46:53 AM] Joe: Haha what??? Is that bad or good.
"
99,"[4/25/20, 4:49:28 AM] Joe: https://youtu.be/lmsbHGEB6UU
"
100,"[4/25/20, 4:54:03 AM] Joe: I think it’ll be coming out in February 2021 but I’ll make sure you get to see it somehow 😊
"
101,"[4/25/20, 4:55:31 AM] Joe: Haha ok ok I’ve embarrassed myself enough for one night. I’m getting tired and making bad decisions like sending you music 😂 😂
"
102,"[4/25/20, 4:55:49 AM] Joe: I’ll have to get some embarrassing stuff out of you sometime
"
103,"[4/25/20, 4:58:33 AM] Joe: Haha that’s a good idea. I try to play upbeat stuff when I’m working too
"
104,"[4/25/20, 5:02:35 AM] Joe: That’s good to know. I’m glad you got a few songs out of me that you like.

106,"[4/25/20, 11:34:12 AM] Joe: Sorry, I had to go back to sleep for a little longer haha 😴 
"
107,"[4/25/20, 12:00:32 PM] Joe: Hahahaha not the most enjoyable way to wake up 😂 
"
108,"[4/25/20, 12:02:14 PM] Joe: His name is Oni and he is Ang’s cat. He loves to meow a little too much sometimes which can be annoying but he’s alright.
"
109,"[4/25/20, 12:02:44 PM] Joe: He is like me though. Only super affectionate if he is comfortable with you. He runs away from strangers haha
"
110,"[4/25/20, 12:32:52 PM] Joe: Damn that sounds rough. I wonder how long until there are zero restrictions? This whole thing is so weird.
"
111,"[4/25/20, 12:34:04 PM] Joe: Yeah dogs are the best. I want a dog again soon!
"
112,"[4/25/20, 12:35:39 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I guess that’s true. Good thing I don’t run away from strangers or I wouldn’t be talking to you ☺️
"
113,"[4/25/20, 12:44:49 PM] Joe: I like your attitude 🔥🔥
"
114,"[4/25/20, 12:46:53 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m waiting for the right time too. I need to settle in somewhere first. Wouldn’t be fair to the dog otherwise.
"
115,"[4/25/20, 12:48:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh noooo 🙈
"
116,"[4/25/20, 12:59:27 PM] Joe: Yeah I was impressed by the old people weed haha. Not bad! I always assume old people have bammer(bad weed)
"
117,"[4/25/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I guess I prefer “chucho”(we call a dog without a breed “mutt”). 
"
118,"[4/25/20, 1:14:46 PM] Joe: I mean, they’re the way nature made them, and that’s fine with me. 
"
119,"[4/25/20, 1:27:36 PM] Joe: I feel similar about the business from dog breeding. I would never hold it against a dog for being a pure breed and would still love them but I couldn’t bring myself to seek out a pure bred dog when looking to get one if that means I’m helping those kind of businesses. 
"
120,"[4/25/20, 3:27:56 PM] Joe: 🤔 looks kind of flat. Is it a picture? Oh, or a book?
"
121,"[4/25/20, 3:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha I really don’t know. What is it?
"
122,"[4/25/20, 3:29:50 PM] Joe: A letter. Written with a feather pen like it’s the 1700s hahaha
"
123,"[4/25/20, 3:35:55 PM] Joe: 😂 I never would’ve guessed that!
"
124,"[4/25/20, 3:37:18 PM] Joe: Very cool though
"
125,"[4/25/20, 3:38:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah you’ll get it down I’m sure.
"
126,"[4/25/20, 3:45:25 PM] Joe: Damn that’s a good idea. I just go to my cousin and tell him the idea and we figure out hahaha

128,"[4/25/20, 3:49:46 PM] Joe: I have been wanting to get another one lately but I can’t think of what to get 🤔
"
129,"[4/25/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Silly! But I don’t think it’s silly at all 🙃 that makes sense
"
130,"[4/25/20, 4:03:20 PM] Joe: I don’t really know exactly where I want the next one but I want one on my side wrapping around to the front a little, like the rib cage area I guess.  And more on my back would be nice. I take forever to think of something though
"
131,"[4/25/20, 4:03:42 PM] Joe: Oh maybe the forearm too
"

139,"[4/25/20, 4:18:57 PM] Joe: Hahah infamous

"
141,"[4/25/20, 4:29:36 PM] Joe: No worries! Plenty of time hahaha take some tomorrow or whenever you feel like it.
"
142,"[4/25/20, 4:29:54 PM] Joe: Oh there it is never mind haha
"
143,"[4/25/20, 4:30:52 PM] Joe: My friend used to love making these and would always try to get everyone to drink matte with him hahaha that’s a cool one
"
144,"[4/25/20, 4:31:15 PM] Joe: Very cute
"
145,"[4/25/20, 4:34:20 PM] Joe: Those are awesome and I love that they have meaning for you. 
"
146,"[4/25/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Muy interesante 😂 
"
147,"[4/25/20, 4:40:41 PM] Joe: He has always lived in the US though
"
148,"[4/25/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂
"
149,"[4/25/20, 4:51:01 PM] Joe: It was good. I drink my coffee black so I kind of like bitter drinks haha. 
"
150,"[4/25/20, 5:04:03 PM] Joe: His straw was aluminum hahaha. I guess he knew what he was doing all along 😂
"
151,"[4/25/20, 5:04:26 PM] Joe: Ok, sleep well. Talk to you later. Un beso
"
152,"[4/26/20, 8:55:49 AM] Joe: Aaaahh I’m awake 😓 I just can’t stay asleep haha
"
153,"[4/26/20, 9:06:44 AM] Joe: My new word is vergüenza because that’s what I feel every time I speak Spanish hahahah

"
161,"[4/26/20, 9:37:14 AM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
162,"[4/26/20, 9:39:27 AM] Joe: At least I’m getting practice. That’s good. I’ve practiced more this week than I have in years. I’m starting to pick it up. 
"
163,"[4/26/20, 9:54:41 AM] Joe: Well, I really appreciate the lessons professor 👩‍🏫

173,"[4/26/20, 12:25:30 PM] Joe: Congratulations! 🍾🎊🎈🎉
"
174,"[4/26/20, 12:26:58 PM] Joe: I love gifs hahaha but maybe I don’t use them as often as you 😂
"
175,"[4/26/20, 12:27:16 PM] Joe: You’re the gif master
"
176,"[4/26/20, 12:29:48 PM] Joe: Yes! Show me!
"
177,"[4/26/20, 12:30:13 PM] Joe: That’s sounds super complicated haha that’s so cool though
"
178,"[4/26/20, 12:41:22 PM] Joe: That’s siiiiick!! How long does it take to model stuff like that? 
"
179,"[4/26/20, 12:53:42 PM] Joe: Cooooool haha I’m definitely going to learn how to do that someday. Looks like you can make some interesting stuff if you get good. 
"
180,"[4/26/20, 12:54:21 PM] Joe: That makes sense. I’m the same when I’m learning something in programming
"
181,"[4/26/20, 1:04:03 PM] Joe: Nice. Definitely send more of your work to me if you need someone to show off to haha I’m very interested in it!
"
182,"[4/26/20, 1:08:57 PM] Joe: My stuff is boring hahah. The last thing I worked on was a website so I guess I can show you that. I only did a few parts of it though. The top section and “the team” section. 
"
183,"[4/26/20, 1:16:07 PM] Joe: No I don’t chose any design at all. I just build it to look like what the designer made.
"
184,"[4/26/20, 1:16:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
185,"[4/26/20, 1:17:42 PM] Joe: So if you need a website you can draw up what you want or make it using a program called Adobe XD and I can make it for you 👍
"
186,"[4/26/20, 1:18:03 PM] Joe: But don’t ask me to design anything cause I’m terrible at that part hahaha
"

188,"[4/26/20, 1:28:34 PM] Joe: Good team for sure! Definitely hit me up when you need one. I’d be stoked to build one for you!
"
189,"[4/26/20, 1:30:36 PM] Joe: Oh and I’d be even more stoked to see you 😂 😅☺️

"
191,"[4/26/20, 1:40:14 PM] Joe: That’s the plan! And yeah, there is a lot of code to make a website.
"
192,"[4/26/20, 1:42:44 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh nooooo 😱

194,"[4/26/20, 1:47:05 PM] Joe: I was just kidding
"
195,"[4/26/20, 1:47:12 PM] Joe: 🤗
"
196,"[4/26/20, 1:50:32 PM] Joe: I said that to make that simple webpage I need to open this program and its all just a bunch of words haha
"
197,"[4/26/20, 1:51:34 PM] Joe: I said too much in the video hahah. But basically it takes all the code I showed in the program to make the website I was showing
"
198,"[4/26/20, 2:01:25 PM] Joe: Send music to me!
"
199,"[4/26/20, 2:05:33 PM] Joe: It’s my turn to judge you haha👨‍⚖️
"
200,"[4/27/20, 10:14:12 AM] Joe: Buenas noches 🌙
"
201,"[4/27/20, 10:29:20 AM] Joe: Buenas tardes(?) haha
"
202,"[4/27/20, 10:39:49 AM] Joe: I feel it. Your lockdown sounds extreme. I’m good with not being around people and doing my own thing but it’s nice to mix it up. 
"
203,"[4/27/20, 10:41:04 AM] Joe: Whatever you like haha I’m not super picky with music and I probably won’t actually judge you so send anything 🤙
"
204,"[4/27/20, 10:52:56 AM] Joe: Damn that’s rough. I wonder when it goes back to normal completely
"
205,"[4/27/20, 10:53:22 AM] Joe: That sounds super chill. At least you have something to look forward to for now.
"
206,"[4/27/20, 11:07:51 AM] Joe: I like this one haha very cool
"
207,"[4/27/20, 11:10:56 AM] Joe: Pretty cool how everyone looks so “low key”(informal) in those last two
"
208,"[4/27/20, 11:11:28 AM] Joe: Haha good choice
"
209,"[4/27/20, 11:15:08 AM] Joe: That’s a good mix. I listen to a pretty wide variety of stuff too. Sometimes I’ll like a song I would usually never like just because it was in a skate video haha so that leads to me liking some weird shit sometimes.
"
210,"[4/27/20, 11:31:27 AM] Joe: Haha I’m not judging you. I like your music but even if I didn’t I wouldn’t judge you for it
"
211,"[4/27/20, 11:32:21 AM] Joe: Sure, I’ll keep you in mind when I hear new songs I like haha. The Hawaiian jams are so good. I love the vibe.
"
212,"[4/27/20, 11:44:08 AM] Joe: Today I’ve been lazy. I’m still sitting in bed with Oni 😂 
"
213,"[4/27/20, 11:50:16 AM] Joe: I’m about to get up and make some breakfast though then send some proposals for that next gig.
"
214,"[4/27/20, 11:57:22 AM] Joe: Hahahaha you don’t want to be like me! 😂 😂
"
215,"[4/27/20, 11:58:24 AM] Joe: Aw man he’s outside already. I’m in the kitchen about to make these pancakes 🥞 😂 
"
216,"[4/27/20, 12:08:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m a fuckin mess right now but alright

218,"[4/27/20, 12:10:20 PM] Joe: I literally got out of bed and went to the kitchen so don’t judge my messy appearance too much please hahahah
"
219,"[4/27/20, 12:10:55 PM] Joe: And somehow I got pancake mix on my arm in that picture 😂
"
220,"[4/27/20, 12:18:02 PM] Joe: Breakfast foods might just be my favorite food so I could it pancakes whenever
"
221,"[4/27/20, 12:40:26 PM] Joe: Well it would’ve been some fruit but we’re all out 🙅‍♂️

223,"[4/27/20, 1:52:04 PM] Joe: Well what do you like to eat? Are you a vegetarian or something like that? 
"
224,"[4/27/20, 2:33:09 PM] Joe: Haha super cute 😆 definitely don’t have to be embarrassed about that hahaha
"
225,"[4/27/20, 2:34:45 PM] Joe: That is a long time to be dancing at home though hahaha. Must be good 🍃 😂
"
226,"[4/27/20, 2:42:42 PM] Joe: You should definitely send more videos of you dancing 💃 Especially in your pajama haha 
"
227,"[4/27/20, 2:49:45 PM] Joe: All good. A lot of the people around here walk around town with less clothes on than that hahaha your pjs are cute that’s all 🤷‍♂️
"
228,"[4/27/20, 3:01:39 PM] Joe: Hahahaha noooooo aaahhhh maybe later for the dancing video 🕺
"
229,"[4/27/20, 3:03:05 PM] Joe: Oh ok. How hot is it out there? 
"
230,"[4/27/20, 3:07:40 PM] Joe: Might as well have no shame when you’re asking me to embarrass myself haha. I owe you a video but I’m not promising when you’ll get it lol

232,"[4/27/20, 3:09:54 PM] Joe: Oh yeah. I feel like I haven’t put a shirt on in weeks hahaha 
"
233,"[4/27/20, 4:25:03 PM] Joe: Yeah I love being near the beach in this hot weather. It’s a life saver haha. 
"
234,"[4/27/20, 4:33:09 PM] Joe: Ooooh I’m so excited I might get my infamous dice game working today hahaha. It’s still super ugly cause like I said I’m terrible at design but if it works that’s all that matters to me. 
"
235,"[4/27/20, 4:47:19 PM] Joe: Yeah I just need to get one more thing working. The game needs to sign out users automatically when they close the game so I’m working on that. 
"
236,"[4/27/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: Your turn is over after you pick up all the dice
"

"
238,"[4/27/20, 4:58:39 PM] Joe: I’ll actually make it look nice and animate some dice if I get bored I guess but I didn’t see the need to impress my friends 😂
"
239,"[4/27/20, 5:01:35 PM] Joe: Exactly!
"
240,"[4/27/20, 5:05:10 PM] Joe: Hahah vintage. Yeah I’ll go with that description hahahaha
"
241,"‎[4/27/20, 5:10:01 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
242,"[4/27/20, 5:12:26 PM] Joe: Dude give me all the design tips hahaha
"
243,"[4/27/20, 5:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha probably just a bunch of gibberish to you but I appreciate you being interested 😂
"
244,"[4/27/20, 5:18:14 PM] Joe: Haha so high!
"
245,"[4/27/20, 5:19:26 PM] Joe: yeaaaaah that’s the bug haha. I’ll send the link when it’s all the way working.
"
246,"[4/27/20, 5:22:15 PM] Joe: Hahahaha it’s broken! I know I know I’m sorry. I’ll get it working for real soon. At least you got to test it once. You can give me design tips and put web designer on your résumé 😂
"
247,"[4/27/20, 5:23:44 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok sounds good. We’ll definitely play together. I should make a chat feature next. It never ends 👨‍💻
"
248,"[4/27/20, 5:26:23 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I’m super stoked. I stopped working on the game for a few days cause I was frustrated I couldn’t get it working. Getting past this step was a big hurdle so I’m happy.
"
249,"[4/27/20, 5:27:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha I guess it could use more of a victory dance type of feel after the win
"
250,"[4/27/20, 5:28:20 PM] Joe: Sound would be interesting just because I’ve never had to add sound to a site. Would probably be pretty simple 🤔
"
251,"[4/27/20, 5:29:43 PM] Joe: I think that was it. I just needed a break. The solution in the end wasn’t even very difficult to fix but finding where the problem was in the first place was killing me. Had a eureka moment this morning while watching some coding seminar thing on YouTube haha
"
252,"[4/27/20, 5:33:46 PM] Joe: If official...Lore the web designer 👩‍🎨
"
253,"[4/27/20, 5:38:21 PM] Joe: That’s solid advice. I could really use a checklist or something when I do stuff like this. I usually just start coding without much of a plan beforehand and it gets me into trouble all the time hahaha
"
254,"[4/27/20, 5:48:07 PM] Joe: Muchas gracias!! Buenas noches! Un beso 😘
"
255,"[4/28/20, 11:01:45 AM] Joe: Hola! Hope you had a good day! I’m just about to get mine started haha. 
"
256,"[4/28/20, 11:27:10 AM] Joe: Mmmm that looks good. No I had eggs and toast today haha
"
257,"[4/28/20, 11:29:45 AM] Joe: I’m only used to 3 hour difference between Hawaii and California haha
"
258,"[4/28/20, 12:11:30 PM] Joe: Glad it’s getting more fun. Now you can start making the cool shit haha. 
"
259,"[4/28/20, 12:13:21 PM] Joe: Usually my sister works in town at the Pearl Factory but town is shut down so she is home for now. 
"
260,"[4/28/20, 12:15:00 PM] Joe: It’s just me and my sister here but my cousins and other family are super close by. Within walking distance.

"
264,"[4/28/20, 12:39:35 PM] Joe: He just wants attention haha. He does like to sleep with me in my bed too. 
"
265,"[4/28/20, 12:40:18 PM] Joe: Police talking to* not taking haha
"
266,"[4/28/20, 12:47:25 PM] Joe: Haha I feel like people having a crazy older flatmate is super common for some reason. 
"
267,"[4/28/20, 12:50:57 PM] Joe: I wish! My sister wouldn’t like that 😂 
"
268,"[4/28/20, 12:56:22 PM] Joe: I mean they were old and white and most likely not from around here.

"
287,"[4/28/20, 2:50:06 PM] Joe: Hahah ok. Cause in English that exact saying usually comes before admitting to something bad.
"
288,"[4/28/20, 2:52:52 PM] Joe: Hahah oooh ok. I never really here it used positively in English but I guess it could be.

292,"[4/28/20, 3:09:42 PM] Joe: Click click
"
293,"[4/28/20, 3:09:46 PM] Joe: I fixed it
"
294,"[4/28/20, 3:10:15 PM] Joe: When you tried my game you went back and the screen went black
"
295,"[4/28/20, 3:11:11 PM] Joe: Yes! And my brother haha. Still more things to fix but we at least got to play a few rounds
"
296,"[4/28/20, 3:12:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha is that mr bean? Cause it looks like mr bean
"
297,"[4/28/20, 3:14:27 PM] Joe: Yeah Mr. Bean is hella funny. I should watch some of his stuff today haha
"
298,"[4/28/20, 3:15:02 PM] Joe: We’ll have to play each other in my game soon 👨‍💻👩‍💻
"
299,"[4/28/20, 3:18:27 PM] Joe: Oh I don’t know if “hella” translates? It’s like “mucho” but you probably got that. 
"
300,"[4/28/20, 3:19:24 PM] Joe: What is some spanish slang you say a lot that probably won’t translate well??
"
301,"[4/28/20, 3:32:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok I understand that. I wouldn’t use it myself cause I’d be afraid to use it at the wrong time haha but I kind of get it

"
311,"[4/28/20, 3:52:01 PM] Joe: Mmm it depends. Sometimes I don’t smoke. But in quarantine I’ve been smoking a lot more haha. Too much time to chill with the other smokers 😂
"
312,"[4/28/20, 3:54:08 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it sucks sometimes but I still have fun talking to you
"
313,"[4/28/20, 4:00:49 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I don’t take notes of it but I will smoke pretty often 😂 
"
314,"[4/28/20, 4:02:55 PM] Joe: That’s out here in Hawaii. I guess in California it’s a lot less cause I work a lot when I’m out there
"
315,"[4/28/20, 4:07:44 PM] Joe: No I don’t like mixing with tabaco really.

344,"[4/29/20, 2:23:54 PM] Joe: More stuff to fix I suppose. It keeps your name in your local memory on your computer. I guess I could delete that when you sign off.
"
345,"[4/29/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: Yeah you could say that. I’m a pretty patient dude

348,"[4/29/20, 2:28:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I’m testing it. There is a problem where it disconnects you after a while if you don’t do anything
"
349,"[4/29/20, 2:29:37 PM] Joe: Oh and you can roll up to 5 times at the most. You have to pick up at least one die every time you roll but can pick up more if you want.
"
350,"[4/29/20, 2:30:14 PM] Joe: Did you sign back in?
"
351,"[4/29/20, 2:30:21 PM] Joe: Go back and join game again

"
353,"[4/29/20, 2:33:51 PM] Joe: Dammit hahaha. Ok go to the home page. You have to take /game off the URL. Then put your name and click join.

"
355,"[4/29/20, 2:34:45 PM] Joe: Noooooo

372,"[4/29/20, 3:34:41 PM] Joe: Damn...rough day. Tomorrow will be better 💪
"
373,"[4/29/20, 3:36:49 PM] Joe: Oh Ok. Good luck getting through it all! Courses can be a little frustrating sometimes but especially the online ones when you’re having problems.

"
387,"[5/1/20, 9:50:01 AM] Joe: What the changes? I made them all yesterday.
"
388,"[5/1/20, 9:55:18 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I noticed that 😂
"
389,"[5/1/20, 9:55:48 AM] Joe: Ok I’ll work on that. The ultimate feature will be built in translation so I can play with you hahaha
"
390,"[5/1/20, 9:57:32 AM] Joe: I have to fix the tie also. It says the first player wins on a tie every time
"
391,"[5/1/20, 9:58:54 AM] Joe: Oh yeah. Um you just have to go to the website again. I haven’t figured out why that happens if you press reload
"
392,"[5/1/20, 10:00:04 AM] Joe: Hahaha I appreciate you taking the time to try it. You give good feedback that makes the game better
"
393,"[5/1/20, 10:06:10 AM] Joe: Haha it was the same guy! My friend Fav does all the illustrations and drew the animations in the Benal video by hand, frame by frame. He was in the video too. I love his style of illustrations
"
394,"[5/1/20, 10:07:37 AM] Joe: Yeah I need emojis, gifs, and pictures for the chat. That’s a little more complicated but it can be done. That would definitely make it cooler.
"
395,"[5/1/20, 10:10:16 AM] Joe: I like how excited you are about the changes to my game hahaha. It makes me want to keep working on it
"

"
401,"[5/1/20, 10:39:39 AM] Joe: I’m about to go on my little morning skate real quick then have some breakfast. If you’re too excited for tomorrow and can’t sleep we can play the game some more hahaha

"
406,"[5/2/20, 2:39:35 PM] Joe: Haha nice! Glad you got to go out in the sun for a bit. Did you make that pizza from scratch?

"
408,"[5/2/20, 3:02:25 PM] Joe: Lol I went from delivery to scratch, but only cause I didn’t have frozen dough. 
"

"
410,"[5/2/20, 3:27:51 PM] Joe: I’m doing great! I’m still working on my game. It went from a dumb thing for my friends, into something I might add to my portfolio if I can polish it up nicely.

418,"[5/2/20, 3:38:29 PM] Joe: Mmm I don’t know. I’ve been trying to come up with something. Waiting for the right name to come to me haha

419,"[5/2/20, 3:39:36 PM] Joe: Haha I should. 
"
420,"[5/2/20, 3:44:10 PM] Joe: This is too true hahahahaha

"
430,"[5/3/20, 2:58:01 PM] Joe: Haha it’s probably hard to notice good spots if you don’t skate. I will try to teach you though.
"
431,"[5/3/20, 2:58:46 PM] Joe: Give me a word in spanish to practice today. The app I downloaded gave me “el alfarero” haha. I need something better than that 😂

"
435,"[5/3/20, 4:34:00 PM] Joe: This is why I need to check with you before just learning these words haha

"
465,"[5/3/20, 5:30:49 PM] Joe: I’m going to say tortitas all the time now haha I like tortitas
"
466,"[5/3/20, 5:34:00 PM] Joe: Nice! I never really paid attention to different accents in spanish cause it all sounded the same to me. Only thing I noticed is they talk faster in Spain haha
"
467,"[5/3/20, 5:40:17 PM] Joe: Interesting 🤔 I didn’t know that.
"
468,"[5/3/20, 5:41:11 PM] Joe: Dammit I’m going to have a stupid accent when I’m done learning 😂 It’ll be some weird mix of all the different accents haha
"
469,"[5/3/20, 5:42:15 PM] Joe: Haha they’ll get too excited. I’m going to be back in California in about a month so I’ll surprise them with some spanish when I get back. They’ll love it
"
470,"[5/3/20, 5:45:52 PM] Joe: Being consistent that’s all that matters to me. I don’t want to switch between accents in the middle of sentences. People will think I’m a weirdo haha
"
471,"[5/3/20, 5:57:25 PM] Joe: Yeah we should do that haha otherwise I’ll just tell them how I want to smoke a joint

"
475,"[5/3/20, 6:11:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was really just joking I’m sorry 😂 
"
476,"[5/3/20, 6:13:27 PM] Joe: But also when you say that, I kind of take it as you wanting to be just friends or something so I don’t push the issue 🤷‍♂️
"
477,"[5/3/20, 6:13:58 PM] Joe: Even though I do like you very much hahaha 🤗🤗
"
478,"[5/3/20, 6:15:39 PM] Joe: If you knew me well, you would’ve thought the gif was funny because I’m faaaar from a “ladies man” hahaha. I’ve had like, 3 girlfriends, all pretty long term relationships
"
479,"[5/3/20, 6:16:52 PM] Joe: I’m definitely not someone that is in constant contact with my friends. I can go a pretty long time without talking to anyone haha
"
480,"[5/3/20, 6:17:39 PM] Joe: And usually I avoid talking to strangers but if it’s a cool girl from across the world or an old hippie giving weed I’ll make an exception lol
"
481,"[5/3/20, 6:19:34 PM] Joe: Haha I’m pretty much the same. The more distance the more fun to talk to maybe 😂
"
482,"[5/3/20, 6:20:24 PM] Joe: It definitely helps when you make me do embarrassing things that you’re so far away
"
483,"[5/3/20, 6:25:00 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got a little bit out of me 🤐
"
484,"[5/3/20, 6:26:15 PM] Joe: 10 years is super long. My longest was 8.

512,"[5/4/20, 1:37:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha I know so many useful phrases! Basically mastered spanish at this point 😂
"
513,"[5/4/20, 1:39:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah a little bit. he definitely wouldn’t have sat there waiting for her phone to die before saying hello when she flew all the way to some random island
"
514,"[5/4/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I agree with you there. I don’t see how the show can go on now though haha!

"
557,"[5/4/20, 3:11:39 PM] Joe: Haha it’s so hard! I’m trying to understand what’s wrong with my D but it sounds different all the time. Not very consistent.
"
558,"[5/4/20, 3:13:03 PM] Joe: Noooo haha. I need more English from you if you’re going to get more spanish out of me 😝
"

"
562,"[5/4/20, 3:25:02 PM] Joe: 😂 I like it. You should send more! Now i understand why you like it when I send you audio of me speaking Spanish.
"
563,"[5/4/20, 3:32:40 PM] Joe: Yeah I still don’t hear it haha. So I’m not putting enough emphasis on the “d”. It sounds like I’m missing the letter or something?
"
564,"[5/4/20, 3:34:38 PM] Joe: The second sentence was supposed to be a question lol
"
565,"[5/4/20, 3:36:05 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll try to pronounce the “d” more loudly. I thought it sounded fine when you said “I don’t care” though
"
566,"[5/4/20, 3:42:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m having a hard time with my Ds 😂
"
567,"[5/4/20, 3:43:38 PM] Joe: I’m listening to your audio, trying to internalize that pronunciation haha

"
578,"[5/4/20, 3:52:24 PM] Joe: Glad I could make you laugh but damn....shame on me Hahahaha
"
579,"[5/4/20, 3:53:46 PM] Joe: I don’t embarrass myself often, but with you it feels like everyday 😂 😂 😂 
"
580,"[5/4/20, 3:55:32 PM] Joe: Haha it’s ok. I give you permission to laugh at me and the audio. It’s all in good fun. 
"
581,"[5/4/20, 3:59:58 PM] Joe: Make fun of me while you can. Cause I’m going to learn how to speak Spanish so good. And with any accent haha.
"
582,"[5/4/20, 4:03:14 PM] Joe: Don’t worry, you messing with me like that probably makes me like you more anyway haha
"
583,"[5/4/20, 4:03:19 PM] Joe: 😂
"
584,"[5/4/20, 4:11:00 PM] Joe: I’m just a shy guy on that you found on the internet. 
"
585,"[5/4/20, 4:12:46 PM] Joe: Hahah no it’s not even embarrassing 😂
"
586,"[5/4/20, 4:12:58 PM] Joe: I just want to know, like, why me? Hahaha
"
587,"[5/4/20, 4:20:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah you like that I’m more of a “dirtbag” than the guys in Madrid 😂
"
588,"[5/4/20, 4:22:16 PM] Joe: Hahahaha ooook sure
"
589,"[5/4/20, 4:24:03 PM] Joe: I definitely thought it was interesting when you messaged me but like I said, that hasn’t happened before so I really didn’t know how to respond other than to answer your question 😂

600,"[5/4/20, 4:41:16 PM] Joe: Lo siento 😆

608,"[5/4/20, 5:06:55 PM] Joe: It said game over so I had to reset

"
612,"[5/5/20, 1:05:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha more design tips from the master. You should work on being a web designer AND interior designer haha. 
"
613,"[5/5/20, 1:07:36 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
614,"[5/5/20, 1:09:08 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s all about having that eye for good design.
"
615,"[5/5/20, 1:09:23 PM] Joe: Which I don’t have. As you can tell by my website and color choices hahaha

617,"[5/5/20, 1:10:54 PM] Joe: I don’t like the green I chose but I’m so bad at picking colors
"
618,"[5/5/20, 1:10:58 PM] Joe: I just gave up
"
619,"[5/5/20, 1:11:35 PM] Joe: Yes I probably should. Pretty sure I’m using Roboto
"
620,"[5/5/20, 1:12:57 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll try those colors instead of mushed pea green hahaha I pick gross colors 😂
"
621,"[5/5/20, 1:15:24 PM] Joe: Aren’t they all the same? Haha. Or do you mean to match the buttons in the game? Like roll dice button.
"
622,"[5/5/20, 1:16:20 PM] Joe: 🤔 I’m not sure what you mean. You notice a lot of small details ahah. I think you would be good at this
"
623,"[5/5/20, 1:32:47 PM] Joe: Shit. More color picking haha.
"
624,"[5/5/20, 1:33:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn you’re good
"
625,"[5/5/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: That was quick 😂
"
626,"[5/5/20, 1:35:24 PM] Joe: Learn to use Adobe XD and I bet you’ll be able to land freelance jobs doing graphic/web design. Cause people like me have no idea what we’re doing and need help hahah
"
627,"[5/5/20, 1:44:37 PM] Joe: Adobe XD is mostly drag and drop. More similar to using photoshop than coding. You would be good at it. 
"
628,"[5/5/20, 1:51:24 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it’s a pretty cool program for making small designs. I should really practice using it and work on my design skill 😂 
"
629,"[5/5/20, 2:02:36 PM] Joe: You should’ve seen some of my first website hahaha. Oh god. They looked like they were designed by a 5 year old with a crayon 😂
"
630,"[5/5/20, 2:03:34 PM] Joe: Design is weird to me cause of the subjectivity. The code either works, or it doesn’t. But the design is much harder to tell if it’s good in my opinion
"
631,"[5/5/20, 2:04:18 PM] Joe: Well...I can tell when something is ugly, and I can tell when it looks good. But coming up with the good looking design in my mind is so difficult!
"
632,"[5/5/20, 2:22:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok, enjoy!
"
633,"[5/5/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Yeah when I first started making websites. They were all so ugly. Good thing I didn’t save those haha
"
634,"[5/5/20, 3:44:02 PM] Joe: The best part is you never fully know how to code so there is always a bunch you can learn. Makes it so it doesn’t get boring
"
635,"[5/5/20, 3:45:24 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I dont visit enough websites but I started going to random ones for bigger companies to get an idea of how the pros do it
"
636,"[5/5/20, 3:45:55 PM] Joe: I’m really far off from their style hahaha but if I get a design I can make it so it doesn’t matter too much I guess.
"
637,"[5/5/20, 3:48:26 PM] Joe: Look at 3:00, have you ever heard of that haha?
"
638,"[5/5/20, 3:50:09 PM] Joe: About 2 years ago is when I first started making websites but I was doing other kind of coding before that for a year or two.
"
639,"[5/5/20, 3:51:38 PM] Joe: Yeah I need to get better at typography and color combinations the most but also general layout. 
"
640,"[5/5/20, 3:52:15 PM] Joe: I need to improve in my UX skills also haha it’s never ending
"
641,"[5/5/20, 3:54:09 PM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll learn the Peruvian phrases and teach you 😂

643,"[5/5/20, 3:56:29 PM] Joe: Definitely! I really appreciate it! I take criticism of my work pretty well. I just want to get better at doing things haha
"
644,"[5/5/20, 3:58:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was wondering if it was really bad or not. You can hear Denver talking shit about the accent after he says it hahaha
"
645,"[5/5/20, 4:04:21 PM] Joe: Thank you 🙏🏽 you got to see the game evolve over time haha it’s getting better slowly.
"
646,"[5/5/20, 4:04:40 PM] Joe: You had some good input that made it noticeably better
"
647,"[5/5/20, 4:05:27 PM] Joe: Now you’re speaking my language. Que pasa tronca??? Hahaha
"
648,"[5/5/20, 4:05:43 PM] Joe: Que pasa boluda?? Hahaha
"
649,"[5/5/20, 4:08:32 PM] Joe: Alright well your Peruvian slang word for the day is “chela”
"
650,"[5/5/20, 4:10:58 PM] Joe: Hahahahahaha of course
"
651,"[5/5/20, 4:13:37 PM] Joe: Aaah vale. Cómo andás boluda?? I have to remember that

670,"[5/5/20, 4:22:03 PM] Joe: Siiiiii hahaha
"
671,"[5/5/20, 4:24:41 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I nerd out and get kind of hyper focused when I want to learn something. I should’ve learned a long time ago though

673,"[5/5/20, 4:28:11 PM] Joe: motivación para aprender jajaja
"
674,"[5/5/20, 4:34:40 PM] Joe: Mmmm I mean...I used to work at a marijuana distribution center in California so I know a little bit of how it works haha
"
675,"[5/5/20, 4:35:26 PM] Joe: I don’t know what you mean by this
"
676,"[5/5/20, 4:37:23 PM] Joe: Well....it’s all legal, just a lot of regulations. But a licensed farmer takes the crop and gets it tested by the state for purity and quality. They also give the THC/ CBD content as a % of weight.
"
677,"[5/5/20, 4:39:21 PM] Joe: Then the farmer can sell it to a distribution center like the place I worked at. We were small and only would buy maybe 10-20 pounds at a time but big places buy way more. 
"
678,"[5/5/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Then we take our packed product and sell them to retail marijuana stores that can sell to anyone 21+
"
679,"[5/5/20, 4:40:59 PM] Joe: Basically like any other business but a lot of paperwork and regulations. It was an interesting job. It was only me and one of my friends working the whole distribution so it was really fun hahaha
"
680,"‎[5/5/20, 4:42:39 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
681,"[5/5/20, 4:44:06 PM] Joe: I was really good at that job and like it a lot but they treated my friend like shit, then when they fired him I just walked out haha
"
682,"[5/5/20, 4:45:39 PM] Joe: Oooh ok. Yeah I’ve done trimming one season and I didn’t like it hahah. That was more farm work
"
683,"[5/5/20, 4:46:01 PM] Joe: My cousin grows so I tried it with him one year. I like the distribution side haha
"
684,"[5/5/20, 4:46:56 PM] Joe: Usually seasonal work on a farm involves trimming the plant. Usually paid per pound so it’s good money if you’re fast and know how to trim good but when you’re learning it’s not that great haha
"
685,"[5/5/20, 4:48:26 PM] Joe: Haha it was their loss not mine. They thought I’d stay when they fired him. Like I said, we ran the whole thing haha. 
"
686,"[5/5/20, 4:49:09 PM] Joe: Hahaha distribution is hard too!! It had way more variety of stuff to do though and I just found it more fun.
"
687,"[5/5/20, 4:49:35 PM] Joe: The real posh boys are the ones in the retail part hahah
"
688,"[5/5/20, 4:50:22 PM] Joe: They don’t do shit but give the person what they order and they get tips and all kinds of shit.  You’d probably make hella good money working at a cannabis club hahaha
"
689,"[5/5/20, 4:59:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha yeah I think “posh” is good for boy and girl like that. English doesn’t make too many changes based on masculine/feminine. That is one thing that makes spanish hard for me haha
"
690,"[5/5/20, 5:00:40 PM] Joe: When to say “o” or “a” kind of makes sense to me but in practice, switching between them at the right time can be a little hard
"
691,"[5/5/20, 5:01:16 PM] Joe: Mostly when speaking. If I’m typing it’s easier
"
692,"[5/5/20, 5:07:08 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha!!
"
693,"[5/5/20, 5:07:23 PM] Joe: “I love my bitches” hahahahahaha

720,"[5/6/20, 9:50:43 AM] Joe: How was the course today? You figure out that leaf texture??
"
721,"[5/6/20, 9:55:08 AM] Joe: Haha another example of me being terrible with colors!
"
722,"[5/6/20, 10:13:04 AM] Joe: Haha alright cool! Sounds like I have something to do today now 😂 
"
723,"[5/6/20, 10:13:39 AM] Joe: I appreciate the thought you’re putting into this haha it really does help a lot
"
724,"[5/6/20, 10:20:57 AM] Joe: I would help you with your leaf textures on 3ds Max but I have no clue how that works 😂

726,"[5/6/20, 10:32:09 AM] Joe: Oooooh that might be difficult to make it work, but cool idea, I could see that making it a lot more dynamic and engaging
"
727,"[5/6/20, 10:32:19 AM] Joe: I’ll see what I can do
"
728,"[5/6/20, 11:12:25 AM] Joe: When you make something you worked really hard on or you’re proud of, send some photos
"
729,"[5/6/20, 11:14:24 AM] Joe: Aaah it’s a good thing. These ideas will help make everything look complete instead of like a half finished project. Plus any tips you give me to work on are good practice for me.
"
730,"[5/6/20, 11:14:57 AM] Joe: You’re definitely keeping me busy though boss haha
"
731,"[5/6/20, 11:17:11 AM] Joe: 😂 😂

739,"[5/6/20, 11:45:59 AM] Joe: Just kidding. It looks pretty cool. But how do people know the score?
"
740,"[5/6/20, 11:46:56 AM] Joe: It definitely seems like the more simple you make it the better it looks hahaha. Less is more or something
"
741,"[5/6/20, 11:47:21 AM] Joe: Ooooh that’s what you meant
"
742,"[5/6/20, 11:47:31 AM] Joe: Ok ok
"
743,"[5/6/20, 11:49:12 AM] Joe: That’s the small detail I need. Oooh this is going to be good. I’m already starting to make changes now haha

"
749,"[5/6/20, 11:57:31 AM] Joe: True. Doesn’t need to be too big I guess
"
750,"[5/6/20, 11:59:13 AM] Joe: Players. I can probably make it small. I don’t know haha I guess I don’t play enough games either 😂
"
751,"[5/6/20, 11:59:28 AM] Joe: I should go play some games. It will be “research”
"
752,"[5/6/20, 12:09:48 PM] Joe: This looks super good! Only thing is that more than 2 people can play.
"
753,"[5/6/20, 12:10:18 PM] Joe: I haven’t put a limit yet but it’ll probably be a 6 or 7 person limit

"
759,"[5/6/20, 2:13:46 PM] Joe: I’m about to build a table with my sister right now I guess. We’re staining the wood

822,"[5/7/20, 10:44:15 PM] Joe: Thanks! Yeah i like how it came out. I told my sister she should make and sell furniture and other stuff haha she’s good at making things. I just helped 😆
"
823,"[5/7/20, 10:45:34 PM] Joe: Looks like a beautiful morning. I’d be awake at the crack of dawn with that window haha. I have blackout curtains but my body still knows the sun is coming up somehow
"
824,"[5/7/20, 10:49:22 PM] Joe: She one of the managers at a jewelry store. One of those ones that let you open an oyster to get a pearl. Then they set the pearl in jewelry.
"
825,"[5/7/20, 10:51:40 PM] Joe: Well they also sell jewelry without the oyster and pearl thing but I think the pearl thing is interesting haha. 
"
826,"[5/7/20, 10:54:01 PM] Joe: Oh god if you think 8 is early you’d think I’m insane sometimes hahaha
"
827,"[5/7/20, 11:05:15 PM] Joe: I just helped her make this one but I want to make her a website. My brother can do the marketing haha. She just has to make things she likes making.

"
832,"[5/7/20, 11:08:17 PM] Joe: 🤔
"
833,"[5/7/20, 11:11:41 PM] Joe: Nice rail 😂 looks hard with the break in the middle but low enough to get on. That ground might need some work haha
"
834,"[5/7/20, 11:13:15 PM] Joe: A lot of skaters call the rails with 2 side by side “shotgun” rails
"
835,"[5/7/20, 11:14:14 PM] Joe: Yeah the stairs look so long haha. Need more height, less length to jump down without grinding the rail
"
836,"[5/7/20, 11:15:59 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t expect you to know 🤷‍♂️
"
837,"[5/7/20, 11:16:25 PM] Joe: But I definitely appreciate the pictures!

"
864,"[5/9/20, 3:12:55 AM] Joe: Haha I wish! We use a certain camera and basically my friend that puts it all together would never use footage I got of myself out here. It wouldn’t look right without the right equipment and someone to film. 
"
865,"[5/9/20, 3:15:18 AM] Joe: You can’t wait to have all your freedom back 😂

866,"[5/9/20, 3:19:50 AM] Joe: Hahaha actually I do. I used to make YouTube videos a few years ago 😂

915,"[5/9/20, 4:28:25 AM] Joe: Those are the good spots near me here in Hawaii. 
"
916,"[5/9/20, 4:39:24 AM] Joe: Nooo worries! I’m just getting tired so I’m probably going to fall asleep in a second here haha. I can feel it coming so if I stop messaging you, you know why 😴
"
917,"[5/9/20, 4:40:15 AM] Joe: It’s about perfect I would say. Not too high, not too low.
"
918,"[5/9/20, 4:41:31 AM] Joe: Haha yeah that place is my nice and it has my favorite thing to skate so it’s a cool spot.
"
919,"[5/9/20, 4:43:32 AM] Joe: No video of the railing 😞 I would really only skate a rail like that if I was filming with my friends. Hard to get the motivation to skate stuff like that alone
"
920,"[5/9/20, 4:47:21 AM] Joe: Haha yesssss you’re getting it. I’m looking forward to these pictures 😂 
"
921,"[5/9/20, 4:48:21 AM] Joe: Those are cute. I see what kind of small houses you like haha. I’ll send photos when I see them
"
922,"[5/9/20, 4:51:00 AM] Joe: Hahaha alright alright maybe I should sleep. You’re waking me back up!
"
923,"[5/9/20, 4:51:40 AM] Joe: I don’t have anything planned tomorrow so it’s ok haha. No worries.
"
924,"[5/9/20, 4:52:24 AM] Joe: Haha talk to you tomorrow. Un beso

"
927,"[5/9/20, 11:29:57 AM] Joe: YouTube haha. I couldn’t believe it when you said you already watched some of them 🤦‍♂️ 
"
928,"[5/9/20, 11:33:48 AM] Joe: Oh yeah, my last night hahaha
"
929,"[5/9/20, 11:38:36 AM] Joe: Haha yes really
"
930,"[5/9/20, 11:38:51 AM] Joe: Hahahaha!
"
931,"[5/9/20, 11:39:41 AM] Joe: All you had to say was you found them. I know what the videos are like so once you said you saw a few I could only imagine which ones and how bad they are hahaha
"
932,"[5/9/20, 11:43:10 AM] Joe: HaHahahahah I can feel you judging me from across the planet 😂
"
933,"[5/9/20, 11:46:46 AM] Joe: Good thing there are no spanish subtitles hahah
"
934,"[5/9/20, 11:48:15 AM] Joe: Oh fuck, YouTube added auto-translate hahahahahaha
"
935,"[5/9/20, 11:57:35 AM] Joe: Ok, time to go skate. Hit me up later. 
"

"
941,"[5/9/20, 1:17:58 PM] Joe: Haha she knows I have the paddington tattoo so that’s probably why.
"
942,"[5/9/20, 1:23:31 PM] Joe: FUCK
"
943,"[5/9/20, 1:24:35 PM] Joe: Ok if you found me flying airplanes you might as well see what it looked like when I got really good at it hahaha
"
944,"[5/9/20, 1:24:59 PM] Joe: I was sponsored and this dude gave me free airplanes to fly 😂 
"
945,"[5/9/20, 1:25:34 PM] Joe: I only got into it because I hurt my ankle so bad skating that I couldn’t really skate for almost a year. DONT JUDGE ME!!!!!
"
946,"[5/9/20, 1:25:54 PM] Joe: I needed something to do hahah oh fuck me god dammit
"
947,"[5/9/20, 1:27:56 PM] Joe: Ok I’m going to go die of shame now, thanks hahahahaha
"
948,"[5/9/20, 1:33:40 PM] Joe: Haha it felt like skateboarding to me. Trying to make the plane look like it’s doing tricks with style. Making it dance in the sky. Plus it felt like doing flip tricks on a skateboard. Flip the plane fast and try to stop it at the right time and fly away smooth. It was fun 🤷‍♂️
"
949,"[5/9/20, 1:33:51 PM] Joe: I don’t have planes anymore though haha
"
950,"[5/9/20, 1:39:11 PM] Joe: Partly because my ankle got better and I could finally skate again....and partly because the dude that was giving me free planes suddenly passes away and that I a CRAZY expensive hobby. Definitely couldn’t have flown those big ones if they weren’t free hahaha

"
964,"[5/9/20, 3:54:20 PM] Joe: Hahahaha good memes!
"
965,"[5/9/20, 3:56:31 PM] Joe: I saw a few more episodes the other day. It’s definitely my favorite show right now. Great recommendation 👍 
"
966,"[5/9/20, 4:15:42 PM] Joe: Whaaat!? Am I on the last already? I though it was the second to last. Damn. I better slow down haha
"
967,"[5/9/20, 4:18:01 PM] Joe: Yeah that security dude is an asshole, so is that new dude that was in charge before Tokyo took over.

"
976,"[5/9/20, 9:09:50 PM] Joe: But then she died 😔
"
977,"[5/9/20, 9:10:14 PM] Joe: Now I don’t like your recommendation anymore. How could they kill Nairobi!?

"
1013,"[5/9/20, 9:51:14 PM] Joe: Hahah I don’t know. But it’s that kind of back of the throat sound you make when you say it that I’m missing even if I technically say it right. It still sounds wrong haha

"
1025,"[5/9/20, 10:07:55 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha what have I gotten myself into???

"
1036,"[5/9/20, 10:51:32 PM] Joe: Hmmm I want to describe what I’m like when I really care about someone but I don’t want to seem weird haha. Fuck. I guess it’s me though
"
1037,"[5/9/20, 10:53:35 PM] Joe: Hopefully you understand what I’m trying to say and I don’t seem weird hahaha fuck.
"
1038,"[5/9/20, 10:56:16 PM] Joe: Also I’ll lay in bed with you all day long if that’s what you mean hahaha

"
1045,"[5/9/20, 11:22:29 PM] Joe: You being so far away is a little annoying right now hahaha fuck. I don’t like what you’re doing to me. I’m not supposed to tell anyone anything about me 😂

"
1049,"[5/9/20, 11:35:36 PM] Joe: Haha one day I swear!
"
1050,"[5/9/20, 11:47:23 PM] Joe: 😂

1051,"[5/9/20, 11:48:06 PM] Joe: No I haven’t heard that before but I like the translation. That’s what I want.
"
1052,"[5/10/20, 12:06:54 AM] Joe: Aah ok I get it. That’s really cool. I should check out Costa Rica. Sounds amazing and like they appreciate the slow life like here. I have to improve my spanish haha. Then we can meet in Costa Rica 😂
"
1053,"[5/10/20, 12:25:00 AM] Joe: Haha looks like a good time

"
1058,"[5/10/20, 1:02:54 AM] Joe: Haha thanks. I made the winner animate in when the game is done too. Thanks for the suggestion haha
"
1059,"[5/10/20, 1:03:11 AM] Joe: Ooh testing my game haha. Cool
"
1060,"[5/10/20, 1:04:29 AM] Joe: There are a few things that got messed up like the size and alignment of my buttons but its overall better. 
"
1061,"[5/10/20, 1:05:12 AM] Joe: My design consultant from Spain
"
1062,"[5/10/20, 1:07:06 AM] Joe: I mean you said it would be better if it was smaller so I tried it out haha
"
1063,"[5/10/20, 1:07:34 AM] Joe: Video what?
"
1064,"[5/10/20, 1:12:50 AM] Joe: Hahaha you can’t help but give more suggestions.
"
1065,"[5/10/20, 1:13:34 AM] Joe: Haha oh I guess I didn’t do it how you imagined. It just comes from the side. I’ll add some falling confetti and make it bounce or something hahaha
"
1066,"[5/10/20, 1:14:38 AM] Joe: It needs to be better! Give all the suggestions. I told you I’m terrible at design. I just think it’s funny. You have the eye and you like to do it so you can’t help yourself hahah
"
1067,"[5/10/20, 1:18:25 AM] Joe: Sooo winner used to just suddenly appear after every game. Now it slides from the right and the logo moves up. Right?
"
1068,"[5/10/20, 1:20:50 AM] Joe: But like I said I’ll add more animation haha. Confetti and bouncing “winner” or something
"
1069,"[5/10/20, 1:22:49 AM] Joe: Not even close to being bothered by it
"
1070,"[5/10/20, 1:23:11 AM] Joe: I’ll move everything up a little bit
"
1071,"[5/10/20, 1:35:21 AM] Joe: I do. Why? I’m not good at design but I’ve been trying to learn. And I appreciate unique architecture when I see it for sure. I used to drive around and just look at houses for no reason hahah
"
1072,"[5/10/20, 1:40:38 AM] Joe: Woooaah that’s fucking awesome haha
"
1073,"[5/10/20, 1:41:42 AM] Joe: Haha alright I’m about to check out this video
"
1074,"[5/10/20, 1:49:08 AM] Joe: Holy shit hahah that’s tight
"
1075,"[5/10/20, 1:51:13 AM] Joe: He definitely seems like a super interesting dude. I love how that building turned out. So cool looking
"

"
1079,"[5/10/20, 2:24:07 PM] Joe: I’m alright. Just doing some work given to me by this web designer girl from Spain haha
"
1080,"[5/10/20, 3:11:45 PM] Joe: Hahah ok I am pushing the updates to the website now 😂
"
1081,"[5/10/20, 3:30:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks! I just did what you suggested. Definitely gives the site a better look/feel
"
1082,"[5/10/20, 3:32:32 PM] Joe: Yeah I didn’t like the way the dice would move all over the place after you pick one. Sometime it would make you choose the wrong dice because they’d move after you pick one up. Now they animate off the screen after you pick one but the remaining dice stay still
"
1083,"[5/10/20, 3:33:53 PM] Joe: Haha let me see the photo. It was butt ugly when I first showed you 😂
"
1084,"[5/10/20, 3:34:14 PM] Joe: Gracias 🙃
"
1085,"[5/10/20, 3:35:56 PM] Joe: 🤔 no I don’t think I changed anything like that. You could always pick up one or more after each roll
"
1086,"[5/10/20, 3:36:23 PM] Joe: Hah yesssss. Small details haha

"
1093,"[5/10/20, 3:49:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I got way too into making this game. It’s been really good practice though. I’ve learned about a bunch of stuff I’ve never used before to make this one.

1096,"[5/10/20, 3:53:20 PM] Joe: fine whatever hahahahaha
"
1097,"[5/10/20, 3:58:14 PM] Joe: The funny thing is I was going to stop at the point where it worked. I just wanted to play with my friends. 
"
1098,"[5/10/20, 3:59:01 PM] Joe: Most features were requested by others. I just built it haha
"
1099,"[5/10/20, 4:07:44 PM] Joe: Yeah now I just need to come up with more ideas that they like so they’ll help me with ideas haha
"
1100,"[5/10/20, 4:47:49 PM] Joe: Haha that’s ok it’s late there. You probably have the course tomorrow too. You should get some rest
"
1101,"[5/10/20, 4:48:51 PM] Joe: Haha I’ll show you eventually. It’s supposed to be very minimal. Just enough to sell some items
"
1102,"[5/10/20, 4:48:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
1103,"[5/10/20, 4:48:58 PM] Joe: Mmmm

"
1107,"[5/10/20, 5:00:22 PM] Joe: Uuuuuuh suuuure if you want me to be just kidding 😬

1109,"[5/10/20, 5:05:58 PM] Joe: Well...it depends. Are you tied down in Madrid? I could go anywhere really 🤷‍♂️
"
1110,"[5/10/20, 5:07:35 PM] Joe: Also depends on what you’d want. Would you want to meet me for a short while like a a few weeks or longer or shorter? Or not at all hahaha
"
1111,"[5/10/20, 5:08:48 PM] Joe: I’ll get those cool new headphones with the built in translator 😂 😂
"
1112,"[5/10/20, 5:10:08 PM] Joe: Or you can just meet me back in Hawaii after summer haha
"
1113,"[5/10/20, 5:17:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know...like you said, you’re a 31 year old woman...and I’m a 30 year old man. 
"
1114,"[5/10/20, 5:17:49 PM] Joe: Sounds fun
"
1115,"[5/10/20, 5:19:35 PM] Joe: Haha sorry maybe you should sleep on it and answer later
"
1116,"[5/10/20, 5:27:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what you expected when you’re trying to lure me in 😂 
"
1117,"[5/10/20, 5:29:21 PM] Joe: It was hard to ask haha. I’ve been thinking about it recently though and I don’t see why not. Am I just going to message you on WhatsApp forever? Or ask you to go on an adventure?
"
1118,"[5/10/20, 5:31:10 PM] Joe: Take your time. And I won’t be crushed if you say no. But I would love if you said yes. I understand it’s kind of crazy.
"
1119,"[5/10/20, 5:32:28 PM] Joe: Seriously...answer in a day or two. Or a week or a month. When you’re ready. But think about it
"
1120,"[5/10/20, 5:35:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah fuck yeah. We’ll get you there. That’s no problem at all.
"
1121,"[5/10/20, 5:37:23 PM] Joe: Looks like Hawaii hahaha. Gives you plenty of time to change your mind. I’m excited though

"
1125,"[5/10/20, 5:45:03 PM] Joe: Honestly this would be the craziest thing I’ve ever done haha
"
1126,"[5/10/20, 5:48:12 PM] Joe: Is there anything I should know now? Hahaha

1128,"[5/10/20, 5:51:18 PM] Joe: Alright alright. Well i guess you should start working on your English in that case haha.
"
1129,"[5/10/20, 5:54:12 PM] Joe: If you change your mind when you aren’t so stoned let me know 😂 
"
1130,"[5/10/20, 5:54:15 PM] Joe: Go to sleep hahaha
"
1131,"[5/10/20, 5:57:22 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
1132,"[5/10/20, 5:57:45 PM] Joe: I’m sorry! I should’ve asked at a better time. I forget about the time difference haha
"
1133,"[5/10/20, 6:00:53 PM] Joe: That’s true. I’m shocked
"
1134,"[5/10/20, 6:06:36 PM] Joe: Mmmm no I haven’t talked about it with anyone. It was probably about a week ago when I started considering it. When I realized I wake up and send you a message. Like i told you, i don’t talk to people. I’m fine with going long periods of time without talking and being comfortable with it. But I really like to talk to you
"
1135,"[5/10/20, 6:07:59 PM] Joe: Haha hey that’s always an option too 😂 you probably like the island better though.
"
1136,"[5/10/20, 6:12:01 PM] Joe: You have an attitude about life that I like. I like that you are outgoing and reached out to me in the first place. It’s like to tell you things or joke with you in ways that I’m sure are going to make you stop talking to me but you don’t. You seem fun. Lighthearted. I’m down for that
"
1137,"[5/10/20, 6:18:39 PM] Joe: Fuck my life 🤦‍♂️
"
1138,"[5/10/20, 6:19:18 PM] Joe: Well if you can’t come here. We can go somewhere else haha.
"
1139,"[5/10/20, 6:26:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you slowly pulled me out of my shell. You can definitely tell me anything. I’d like to know more but I never know what to ask haha
"
1140,"[5/10/20, 6:28:03 PM] Joe: Haha damn I am keeping you up all night tonight. Whoops 😬
"
1141,"[5/10/20, 6:35:46 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
1142,"[5/10/20, 6:36:14 PM] Joe: In a few months, all our time difference problems can be solved hopefully
"
1143,"[5/10/20, 6:37:05 PM] Joe: Good thing you kept trying haha
"
1144,"[5/10/20, 6:41:15 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok sounds good. No problem. I had fun telling it all. 
"
1145,"[5/10/20, 6:48:21 PM] Joe: No joke. No seré pinocho haha. Sleep well
"
1146,"[5/11/20, 10:45:38 AM] Joe: Hey! Change your mind yet?
"
1147,"[5/11/20, 10:56:10 AM] Joe: Hahahah I’m counting down the days until we make it happen
"
1148,"[5/11/20, 11:13:05 AM] Joe: True. I’m working on my spanish I promise haha. YouTube university
"
1149,"[5/11/20, 11:20:31 AM] Joe: Hahahaha dammit

1150,"[5/11/20, 11:20:39 AM] Joe: You should be saying it in English! Hahaha

1158,"[5/11/20, 11:27:26 AM] Joe: Well it’s funny how you say my name too hahaha 😂
"
1159,"[5/11/20, 11:28:43 AM] Joe: My natural instinct is to say it like Lore kind of like Lorie or Lor
"
1160,"[5/11/20, 11:29:08 AM] Joe: But you say it like in between those two haha
"
1161,"[5/11/20, 11:34:45 AM] Joe: Haha that makes sense. If I think of it that way I’ll get it down fast 😂

"
1182,"[5/11/20, 12:01:56 PM] Joe: 🤣 I don’t think they allow that at this beach ahahaha

1191,"[5/11/20, 12:36:08 PM] Joe: I don’t understand half of what that chick is saying so it’s probably a bunch of nonsense to you ahaha
"
1192,"[5/11/20, 12:36:32 PM] Joe: Yeah and a lot of the words aren’t even English
"
1193,"[5/11/20, 12:40:38 PM] Joe: 😂 didn’t expect that when I started the gif hahaha
"
1194,"[5/11/20, 12:50:25 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah it’s a little much. I’m still trying to understand it completely. My cousins talk like that sometimes so I get to practice often
"
1195,"[5/11/20, 1:20:59 PM] Joe: Hahah hopefully it doesn’t turn into some weird mixture of them all where I’m getting all of the  languages wrong 😆
"
1196,"[5/11/20, 1:33:56 PM] Joe: Haha I know I know. I’m pretty determined to learn this time. Honestly I wasn’t taught much when I was little, only by my grandparents. My dad didn’t teach me anything and my mom only speaks English. 
"
1197,"[5/11/20, 3:24:09 PM] Joe: No hay problema. Cómo estuvo la cena?
"
1198,"[5/11/20, 3:43:03 PM] Joe: Damn sound like a tough situation. That’s rough.
"
1199,"[5/11/20, 3:46:15 PM] Joe: Haha I think my dad grew up in the US in a time where speaking Spanish wasn’t really popular. I don’t know, my grandma always told me he was embarrassed when she would speak Spanish to him in front of his friends when he was younger. He would tell her to speak English to him haha. I think he just wanted to be super American or something 🤷‍♂️
"
1200,"[5/11/20, 3:46:58 PM] Joe: But he speaks Spanish great. I’ll embarrass the fuck out of myself if I try to speak to him in Spanish hahaha
"
1201,"[5/11/20, 3:53:41 PM] Joe: Nope, never. 
"
1202,"[5/11/20, 3:55:57 PM] Joe: I probably wouldn’t even try to talk to him in spanish until I’ve felt confident in my ability for years hahaha. Not even going to do it. I don’t show him much of what I do 😂
"
1203,"[5/11/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I guess he’d be happy. He would probably say something like, “you can get paid more now because you speak two languages” haha. Fucking dads 😂
"
1204,"[5/11/20, 4:00:46 PM] Joe: Oh god Hahahaha
"
1205,"[5/11/20, 4:02:23 PM] Joe: My dad would probably say so much shit to embarrass me knowing I won’t understand half of what he is telling you hahaha fuuuck
"
1206,"[5/11/20, 4:02:29 PM] Joe: I better learn quick
"
1207,"[5/11/20, 4:07:29 PM] Joe: 😂

"
1210,"[5/11/20, 4:14:36 PM] Joe: And you don’t really have to give me tips. I’m just working on this right now and wanted to show you 👨‍💻
"
1211,"[5/11/20, 4:19:44 PM] Joe: Haha if you have an eye for what looks good in a room or on a wall, it’s very similar. It’s mostly about placement and relationships between the items on the screen to create the feeling you want. Drawing the eye to the important details and making the less important things a little more subtle, but still there and easy to read.
"
1212,"[5/11/20, 4:20:07 PM] Joe: Haha no link yet. It’s only on my computer for now.
"
1213,"[5/11/20, 4:26:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. I know it’s more than that and I hope you explain in more detail when you can. I want to hear more about it!
"
1214,"[5/11/20, 4:27:54 PM] Joe: I was working on this for a month already before I started my dice game. I’ve been working slowly on this though cause no one I know needs it haha. Less motivation.
"
1215,"[5/11/20, 4:29:07 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure. You can still teach me the basics so I know more what it’s about
"
1216,"[5/11/20, 4:36:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah these are all just “stock” images from the web I used to make the layout. It’s just a fake store for now.
"
1217,"[5/11/20, 4:37:17 PM] Joe: I did the design but it’s just super basic so it was easier. Just keep it to rectangular shapes and make the items in a grid. I just need to work on the buttons and the checkout process then it’s ready for real items.
"
1218,"[5/11/20, 4:38:49 PM] Joe: Ok ok. These are the 2D plans? Then later you can make a badass 3D model with lighting and all the good shit??
"
1219,"[5/11/20, 4:39:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh I can’t wait until you can make a whole tiny house in 3D. You can build your dream house and show it to me hahaha
"
1220,"[5/11/20, 4:39:34 PM] Joe: Then maybe I can build it 😂
"
1221,"[5/11/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Haha I would be just as bad at doing that layout as I am at web design 😂

"
1224,"[5/11/20, 4:59:16 PM] Joe: I’m working on it. I’ve been paying attention to detail more in things like advertisements and other websites. Also subscribed to a bunch of web design YouTube channels recently haha
"
1225,"[5/11/20, 5:00:13 PM] Joe: Haha cool! Now I just need some real items. I guess I could always find something to sell and do it myself 😂
"
1226,"[5/11/20, 5:01:14 PM] Joe: https://dribbble.com
"
1227,"[5/11/20, 5:01:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve been looking at this one lately
"
1228,"[5/11/20, 5:02:25 PM] Joe: The more resources the better. I drown myself in information and just pick up bits and pieces to learn haha
"
1229,"[5/11/20, 5:03:09 PM] Joe: What’s the second link?
"
1230,"[5/11/20, 5:03:34 PM] Joe: Oh never mind. Just had to read it duh haha
"
1231,"[5/11/20, 5:08:44 PM] Joe: That’s smart. I started by righting down color pallets i found online in my notebook hahaha. Like a caveman
"
1232,"[5/11/20, 5:09:15 PM] Joe: Haha cool glad I could give you some design resources you haven’t seen before.

"
1236,"[5/11/20, 5:19:54 PM] Joe: Aaah ok ok. I’ll check it out. Add it to the workflow haha. Better than the notebook for sure 😂
"
1237,"[5/11/20, 5:20:09 PM] Joe: 😂 basically
"
1238,"[5/11/20, 5:24:38 PM] Joe: Damn super simple haha. Alright alright I’ll use it
"
1239,"[5/11/20, 5:26:04 PM] Joe: Lol it’s ok I can see it fine. I should’ve known about this a long time ago. I probably would’ve saved way more content that I’ve just forgotten about
"
1240,"[5/11/20, 5:30:10 PM] Joe: Sounds perfect to me. My notes are always a scattered mess hahah
"
1241,"[5/11/20, 5:30:50 PM] Joe: You’re getting bored talking about it? Or not getting bored? Hahah
"
1242,"[5/11/20, 5:30:59 PM] Joe: Oh ok hahah no not at all
"
1243,"[5/11/20, 5:32:35 PM] Joe: Yeah it was a bad translation. I was worried for a second hahah. Thought I was boring you. But no, these are the things I’m interested in so you’re not boring me even a little
"
1244,"[5/11/20, 5:36:40 PM] Joe: no worries. I knew it was a bad translation because you said you, “find it hard to stop”. Wouldn’t be hard if it was boring hahah
"
1245,"[5/11/20, 5:38:21 PM] Joe: Do you always stay up so late? You’re a night owl haha. You even eat dinner pretty late.
"
1246,"[5/11/20, 5:42:47 PM] Joe: Aaaah ok that makes sense. I stay up super late sometimes like I said before but I think more often I fall asleep early. At least compared to the schedule you’re on right now haha. I only get on the late night schedule when I have a project that I’m working on and need to get the ideas out before I forget 😂

"
1250,"[5/11/20, 5:51:34 PM] Joe: If you think staying up late to talk to me makes you look silly....how are you going to look when you go halfway around the world to meet me? Hahahah
"
1251,"[5/11/20, 5:51:50 PM] Joe: Just kidding....don’t change your mind 😂 😂 😂
"
1252,"[5/11/20, 6:00:34 PM] Joe: If you can’t come to Hawaii I’ll gladly meet you anywhere in the world.

"
1258,"[5/12/20, 12:13:12 PM] Joe: Mm I guess I woke up for a while during the night. Maybe at around 4. I think I just stayed up a little too long when I woke up.

1261,"[5/12/20, 12:20:33 PM] Joe: Here...this is my favorite radio station on the island if you want to try to find some new island music. Maybe it will help hahaha
"
1262,"[5/12/20, 12:21:56 PM] Joe: That’s the actual radio station so you’ll probably hear commercials and all that too. But they play some good shit

"
1271,"[5/12/20, 12:52:04 PM] Joe: I’ve been trying to learn the basics again haha. I found out that you can understand about 80% of spoken Spanish if you learn the 1000 most used words 
"
1272,"[5/12/20, 12:54:33 PM] Joe: Work smarter not harder hahaha I’m definitely going to get a book or some resource with the top 1000 words soon
"

"
1292,"[5/12/20, 1:15:35 PM] Joe: But now I need to find out how many English words you need to learn to get a good understanding. Going to need it if you’re going to Hawaii 😂 
"
1293,"[5/12/20, 1:16:26 PM] Joe: Haha you can save it and use it to embarrass me later
"
1294,"[5/12/20, 1:17:16 PM] Joe: If you say so 😂 😂 😂
"
1295,"[5/12/20, 1:19:34 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m seriously going to find out how many words
"
1296,"[5/12/20, 1:20:05 PM] Joe: But I would be happy to come visit you in Spain so I’m not complaining there haha
"
1297,"[5/12/20, 1:21:25 PM] Joe: “
"
1298,"[5/12/20, 1:22:24 PM] Joe: Oh we’re going to meet hahah whether I go there or you come here or we go wherever we want...it’ll happen. I promise.
"
1299,"[5/12/20, 1:25:22 PM] Joe: Haha true true. 5% different is weird though. In spanish you get 80% understanding with 1000 words but only get an additional 5% for the next 1000. 
"
1300,"[5/12/20, 1:26:22 PM] Joe: And native speakers now between 10,000-20,000 words 🤯
"
1301,"[5/12/20, 1:27:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha perfect gifs. I’m really excited to make it happen so I’m glad you’re happy about it.
"
1302,"[5/12/20, 1:29:38 PM] Joe: Aaaah this is going to be hard hahah. It took me about a month or two to memorize the top 200 drug brand names and their generic names when I was a pharmacy technician(like the assistant for the pharmacist)
"
1303,"[5/12/20, 1:30:04 PM] Joe: 😊 😊 😊
"
1304,"[5/12/20, 1:32:10 PM] Joe: Yeah learning those was no fun. Now they’re taking up room in my brain cause I don’t need that shit anymore hahaha
"
1305,"[5/12/20, 1:32:42 PM] Joe: Send 10 words for today. I’ll study them 📖
"
1306,"[5/12/20, 1:35:56 PM] Joe: Haha that’s like a breakfast one. I’ll use that 😂
"
1307,"[5/12/20, 1:42:10 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I’ll have time to study it while you sleep. 
"
1308,"[5/12/20, 1:43:13 PM] Joe: Perfecto 👌🏽
"
1309,"[5/12/20, 1:45:52 PM] Joe: Thank you professor 👩‍🏫 
"
1310,"[5/12/20, 1:48:47 PM] Joe: Oh and if you have more music in spanish for me to listen to, I’ll take that as well haha. 
"
1311,"[5/12/20, 1:56:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha i noticed right away when  I heard “sho”(yo) at the beginning of the song.
"
1312,"[5/12/20, 1:57:21 PM] Joe: “Y yo de día”
"
1313,"[5/12/20, 2:01:13 PM] Joe: I’m going to end up with a strange accent. Mix of all the places haha
"
1314,"[5/12/20, 2:02:26 PM] Joe: Muerte en Hawaii? What are you trying to say 😱 hahaha
"
1315,"[5/12/20, 2:05:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok ok. I’ll try my best to have an accent like yours. I think it sounds beautiful anyway so I’m fine with that 😂
"
1316,"[5/12/20, 2:15:33 PM] Joe: I don’t know why either but I wish I would’ve found out earlier. When I speak with your accent I sound a lot less like a super white boy trying to learn hahaha. I always hated the way my Spanish accent sounded. It’s so bad
"
1317,"[5/12/20, 2:16:17 PM] Joe: Good. I can be my boring self but they’ll at least find my accent interesting. +10 points

"
1326,"[5/12/20, 3:49:30 PM] Joe: Hahah don’t worry I’m just messing with you.
"
1327,"[5/12/20, 3:50:29 PM] Joe: I’m the same so I know exactly what you mean.
"
1328,"[5/12/20, 3:51:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha for sure
"
1329,"[5/12/20, 3:53:59 PM] Joe: Still....same, but with girls haha I was actually really content just being on my own for the time being and talking to girls usually leads to something I wasn’t trying to get into. At least not on purpose haha I’m still glad you messaged me
"
1330,"[5/12/20, 3:56:46 PM] Joe: Glad I can keep your attention from across the world better than the other boys though hahaha
"
1331,"[5/12/20, 3:58:53 PM] Joe: Are you calling me pinocho? Cause I’m a real boy hahaha
"
1332,"[5/12/20, 3:59:26 PM] Joe: 😂 I got no strings. Promise. I’m a real boy hahah
"
1333,"[5/12/20, 4:02:02 PM] Joe: Haha I know what you meant. I wish I was closer to you now, but I’m telling you I’ll make it happen. I’ll be real for you soon enough
"
1334,"[5/12/20, 4:04:12 PM] Joe: Not at all haha that’s real life. I wish it was real for us. Very sooooooooon!!
"
1335,"[5/12/20, 4:06:17 PM] Joe: Knowing someone cares about you is always great but there’s something about feeling their touch. I know people crave that feeling of being together so it’s not weird at all.
"
1336,"[5/12/20, 4:09:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’s me?
"
1337,"[5/12/20, 4:10:20 PM] Joe: 😂

1338,"[5/12/20, 4:11:15 PM] Joe: I guess you seem to be opening up a little more too. I appreciate the honesty.
"
1339,"[5/12/20, 4:15:31 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
1340,"[5/12/20, 4:15:40 PM] Joe: You really don’t think it will happen?
"
1341,"[5/12/20, 4:15:49 PM] Joe: Do you not believe me?
"
1342,"[5/12/20, 4:16:27 PM] Joe: Or will you change your mind? You only like me because you CAN’T see me even if you want to ?hahaha
"
1343,"[5/12/20, 4:20:15 PM] Joe: Alright alright. Let me ask you.....what are your honest expectations? And what would be ideal?(what would make you happiest?)
"
1344,"[5/12/20, 4:22:13 PM] Joe: Haha it’s ok. Think about it. It’s your life. Take some time before you tell me if you need to
"
1345,"[5/12/20, 4:28:58 PM] Joe: Well....you don’t have to put your life on pause for me. You’re a grown up and you have a life outside of talking to a stranger on the internet. Do whatever makes you happy. Just stay in touch and we’ll see what happens.
"
1346,"[5/12/20, 4:32:34 PM] Joe: Hahaha a grownup? Ok never again 😂
"
1347,"[5/12/20, 4:32:51 PM] Joe: Stranger on the internet? Which one?

1348,"[5/12/20, 4:36:51 PM] Joe: Hahah alright. Ugh. This already would’ve been complicated without the pandemic. I don’t know. I’m pretty patient but I know you said you’re not 😂

"
1442,"[5/13/20, 3:55:05 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. I’m getting better. I can notice already, so that’s good.
"
1443,"[5/13/20, 3:59:22 PM] Joe: Muy bien jajajaja me encanta. Más porfi 😂
"
1444,"[5/13/20, 4:02:12 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I understood!

1446,"[5/13/20, 4:06:30 PM] Joe: I don’t know if anyone would say that sentence about someone that’s talking to me though hahaha
"
1447,"[5/13/20, 4:08:44 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry, english is ugly. Español es muy bonita
"
1448,"[5/13/20, 4:09:02 PM] Joe: Hah it’s used. But you would be unlucky talking to me hahahah
"
1449,"[5/13/20, 4:11:28 PM] Joe: Sorry bad joke haha. But my pronunciation is only good because I’ve heard Spanish all my life. A lot of people speak Spanish in California and a lot of my family does. I just never learned enough to converse fluently.
"
1450,"[5/13/20, 4:14:19 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
1451,"[5/13/20, 4:15:28 PM] Joe: I wish I knew spanish. It’d make things a lot easier 😂
"
1452,"[5/13/20, 4:17:55 PM] Joe: But I’ve gotten way better in a few weeks. Listening to hella Spanish music and watched all 4 seasons of la casa haha
"
1453,"[5/13/20, 4:19:17 PM] Joe: And i make sure to read all your messages in Spanish before I translate them and try to figure out what it says beforehand. Definitely need the translator less often. I used it for literally every message at the beginning 🤷‍♂️
"
1454,"[5/13/20, 4:21:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn I only get every few words because my brain is processing words I notice then I miss a few words then I notice another
"
1455,"[5/13/20, 4:21:55 PM] Joe: It’s ok I’ll translate it but I don’t want to haha
"
1456,"[5/13/20, 4:24:38 PM] Joe: Hahaha you have to talk to me slow like a damn baby 😂
"
1457,"[5/13/20, 4:26:47 PM] Joe: Ah mirá vos no sabía blah blah blah hahahaha
"
1458,"[5/13/20, 4:28:29 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂 oh yeaaaah much better
"
1459,"[5/13/20, 4:28:46 PM] Joe: Give me a few more months and I’ll understand perfectly
"
1460,"[5/13/20, 4:33:59 PM] Joe: You’re surprised and going to show me something?? Ahaha fuck I’m already getting it wrong probably haha
"
1461,"[5/13/20, 4:34:52 PM] Joe: Hahahaha well it was true. If you wanted me to speak to you in spanish and for you to speak to me in spanish it wasn’t possible 😂
"
1462,"[5/13/20, 4:35:33 PM] Joe: Haha I guessed correct on this. I learned cambio yesterday haha

"
1466,"[5/13/20, 4:46:05 PM] Joe: That baseball gif has me laughing too much. That’s totally me. All my life hahah
"
1467,"[5/13/20, 4:47:50 PM] Joe: I’m going to go to Peru if I learn!!Hella family in Peru haha
"
1468,"[5/13/20, 4:50:05 PM] Joe: Yeah it sounds really cool. I wish I could’ve seen it when my grandparents were little though. My grandma said she had a penguin as pet! I was jealous when I heard that haha.
"
1469,"[5/13/20, 4:52:45 PM] Joe: I already made up my mind, and even if we don’t end up doing something together I’m leaving California after the summer again so it’s just a matter of where I want to go at this point. Hopefully I’m ready to go to the spanish speaking countries but even if I’m not, what’s a better way to learn than going where everyone speaks Spanish?
"
1470,"[5/13/20, 4:54:03 PM] Joe: I don’t know, I just want to do something exciting I guess. And I’m tired of California haha
"
1471,"[5/13/20, 4:55:56 PM] Joe: Of course I would prefer to end up in the same country as you though. That would be great
"
1472,"[5/13/20, 4:56:55 PM] Joe: The chicks in la casa remind me of my grandma when they do badass shit. She’s a badass lady haha
"
1473,"[5/13/20, 5:01:11 PM] Joe: Hahah I guess it was kind rhetorical(?) like....it is probably the best way to learn. People learn the fastest when they go to a country that speaks the language they’re trying to learn
"
1474,"[5/13/20, 5:04:20 PM] Joe: Haha no worries. By the way, I just got approved to follow that Instagram page that you tried to share with me from. 
"
1475,"[5/13/20, 5:05:19 PM] Joe: Getting to where you are is the goal 😂
"
1476,"[5/13/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: And understanding you without you having to speak in slow motion hahaha
"
1477,"[5/13/20, 5:08:53 PM] Joe: Haha gracias! It’s been really fun getting to know you even with all this language barrier bullshit. Getting that out of the way would be great
"
1478,"[5/13/20, 5:09:19 PM] Joe: But that’s why I’m learning haha
"
1479,"[5/13/20, 5:10:10 PM] Joe: Ah bien. no puedo esperar para juzgar sus memes 👨‍⚖️
"
1480,"[5/13/20, 5:13:51 PM] Joe: Haha ok I have a question. I was going to say “I agree” or “same”. Super short answer. What would you use for that?
"
1481,"[5/13/20, 5:14:42 PM] Joe: Igualmente? Mismo? No se
"
1482,"[5/13/20, 5:15:35 PM] Joe: Haha these will be useful for me
"
1483,"[5/13/20, 5:16:09 PM] Joe: I always end up agreeing with you or feel similar when you describe something haha.
"
1484,"[5/13/20, 5:16:56 PM] Joe: Perfecto. Gracias
"
1485,"[5/13/20, 5:17:37 PM] Joe: 😂 😂
"
1486,"[5/13/20, 5:19:11 PM] Joe: My brain is getting flooded with words and phrases haha. So much information aaaaahhhhhhh
"
1487,"[5/13/20, 5:21:41 PM] Joe: Oh god hahahaha fuck
"
1488,"[5/13/20, 5:22:17 PM] Joe: Eh they made me laugh. Ok send the video and go to bed
"
1489,"[5/13/20, 5:25:45 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll check out the video. Thanks. Ok you get some sleep. I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches Lore
"
1490,"[5/13/20, 5:26:27 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 thanks for the context

1491,"[5/13/20, 5:28:30 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m sure I’ll notice that one. Sleep well

1502,"[5/13/20, 11:06:50 PM] Joe: In English you just have to guess which one people are talking about hahaha always the same
"
1503,"[5/13/20, 11:07:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks for not making fun of me too much. I laughed when I heard the avocado say that line so I had to learn it 😂
"
1504,"[5/13/20, 11:13:03 PM] Joe: Hahah whaaaat 😂
"
1505,"[5/13/20, 11:14:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha no sorry I didn’t even realize that it was making fun of that song 😂 😂
"
1506,"[5/13/20, 11:15:26 PM] Joe: The Justin Bieber version was big as fuck in the US and was pretty annoying hahaha it was everywhere

1511,"[5/13/20, 11:18:26 PM] Joe: Practicar jaja
"
1512,"[5/13/20, 11:20:04 PM] Joe: Ok before I translate this I’m going to guess. Very good. You’re learning a lot of words now.
"
1513,"[5/13/20, 11:20:25 PM] Joe: Already* not now
"
1514,"[5/13/20, 11:20:48 PM] Joe: Maybe haha. I was close though. Not bad. Just talk to me in slow short sentences hahaha

"
1520,"[5/13/20, 11:32:06 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha aaaaaaah fuck
"
1521,"[5/13/20, 11:33:33 PM] Joe: Sorry I was just kidding. When you talk at your normal speed I can barely catch a word so i can’t really talk shit haha

"
1538,"[5/14/20, 1:27:41 AM] Joe: I’ll use these alllll the time. Added to the list

"
1543,"[5/14/20, 2:20:35 AM] Joe: Hahaha I think I laughed a little too much when I first watched that video. That shits hella funny though.
"
1544,"[5/14/20, 2:23:46 AM] Joe: Alright I’m going to bed cause I have to wake up early tomorrow. I’ll let you enjoy your day, you can talk to me in your nighttime haha.

1547,"[5/14/20, 10:24:45 AM] Joe: And she told me a hilarious story about how when she was learning English she would try to say “sheet”(sábana)but would say “shit” instead and no one in my family corrected her hahaha they just let her say “shit” all the time 😂
"
1548,"[5/14/20, 10:53:42 AM] Joe: Hahaha your bad is overflowing. Time to upgrade

"
1550,"[5/14/20, 10:57:53 AM] Joe: Hahaha she didn’t ask anything about why I want to learn and I didn’t tell her yet 😂
"

"
1564,"[5/14/20, 12:45:23 PM] Joe: Woah that’s pretty fuckin cool hahah. Siiiiiick 😂
"
1565,"[5/14/20, 12:46:00 PM] Joe: Way more realistic than I imagined the final result would look like. Not because of your skill or anything but because I didn’t know the program could make things look like that
"
1566,"[5/14/20, 12:47:49 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha “la puta planta, con su puta maceta” 😂 😂 
"
1567,"[5/14/20, 12:48:25 PM] Joe: I would use this chair! Haha very nice work
"
1568,"[5/14/20, 1:01:46 PM] Joe: I want to know more about how it’s done. Seems complicated. Do you make make all the shapes with a bunch of little rectangles, squares, and triangles? Cause that shit seems like it would take forever
"
1569,"[5/14/20, 1:11:25 PM] Joe: Aaah good. Some slow music so I can hear the words better hahah.

"
1594,"[5/14/20, 4:07:16 PM] Joe: 😂 Hone haha I didn’t expect that but it’s good. You can call me that if you want. 
"

"
1603,"[5/15/20, 11:13:27 AM] Joe: Hahaha you did very well. I was taken back for a second when I read “fuck you joe” 😆 didn’t see that coming
"
1604,"[5/15/20, 11:25:12 AM] Joe: Damn... this is fucked. When the lockdown first happened in the US all they were saying was that we need to “flatten the curve” so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. They made it seem like if we just brought the number of cases down to a number the hospitals could handle it would be fine.
"
1605,"[5/15/20, 11:27:19 AM] Joe: But now they’re making it seem like we’re locked down until it is gone completely or there is a vaccine or something. They keep moving the goalpost, which is annoying. 
"
1606,"[5/15/20, 11:28:58 AM] Joe: Also the US is weird because the federal government might end the lockdown but individual states or cities can impose their own lockdowns so everything will open at different times across the country. 
"
1607,"[5/15/20, 11:37:01 AM] Joe: What do you mean, “is there someone who is very interested”? Like, do I have a resource for you to read about it? Or are you saying that I’m interested in it because of how much I explained? Haha sorry 😐
"
1608,"[5/15/20, 11:37:31 AM] Joe: The way the stories change isn’t very confidence inspiring haha
"
1609,"[5/15/20, 11:38:45 AM] Joe: Same hahaha. I’m considered an “independent” in the US. Republicans and democrats both get mad at me cause I talk shit about both sides hahah. Liberals accuse me of being conservative and conservatives accuse me of being liberal but really I’m in the middle and think they’re all idiots hahaha
"
1610,"[5/15/20, 11:40:32 AM] Joe: And the media is the fucking worst. Very biased and it’s super noticeable.
"
1611,"[5/15/20, 11:42:02 AM] Joe: Aaaah ok. If you say it in English take of the “is”. It will sound/read more sarcastic or more like a joke. I don’t know why, but adding “is” makes it sound like a real question haha
"
1612,"[5/15/20, 11:42:31 AM] Joe: Take off* the “if”
"
1613,"[5/15/20, 11:42:36 AM] Joe: Fuck
"
1614,"[5/15/20, 11:42:40 AM] Joe: “Is”*
"
1615,"[5/15/20, 11:42:41 AM] Joe: Haha
"
1616,"[5/15/20, 11:44:21 AM] Joe: If you say, “someone is interested in the topic??” It would be great. Add “mmm” at the beginning or “eh” at the end and you’re a native speaker haha
"
1617,"[5/15/20, 11:46:01 AM] Joe: Haha no not too many. I don’t agree with conservatives or liberals on much so I just talk shot about everyone. I used to be a Democrat which would be liberal but they went fucking insane in the last few years so now I’m stuck in the middle
"
1618,"[5/15/20, 11:47:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeaaaaahhhh
"
1619,"[5/15/20, 11:47:12 AM] Joe: Perfecto
"
1620,"[5/15/20, 11:48:00 AM] Joe: It’s been a long time since I watched the mainstream media. I get news from the internet hahah.
"
1621,"[5/15/20, 11:50:41 AM] Joe: 🤔 I think having a strong family is important. That’s considered a conservative value here. 
"
1622,"[5/15/20, 11:53:30 AM] Joe: I like to save money and I invest a lot of it. Not sure if that’s considered conservative haha
"
1623,"[5/15/20, 11:54:54 AM] Joe: Strong family like you believe in family bond, maybe marriage, although to answer your other question, I’m not really religious. I believe there is something special spiritually about the universe and the world but I don’t believe in organized religion.
"
1624,"[5/15/20, 11:55:44 AM] Joe: I’m not sure I even know what conservative values I have, if any, just that i disagree with the liberals often in this country.
"
1625,"[5/15/20, 11:56:14 AM] Joe: I disagree with conservatives a lot too. I disagree with everything and everyone 😂
"
1626,"[5/15/20, 11:58:13 AM] Joe: Everyone speaks in platitudes with no real solutions. They say things that sound nice and I hate it. 
"
1627,"[5/15/20, 12:00:10 PM] Joe: Haha I have too many thoughts on the subject of politics and media. Should not have got me started 😂
"
1628,"[5/15/20, 12:06:05 PM] Joe: Are you asking if I have any ideas? Well first thing that needs to happen in the US is an end to the massive divide we have right now. If one side has an idea, even if it’s good, the other side opposes it for political posturing. Literally nothing good gets done because we’re split in half. 
"
1629,"[5/15/20, 12:14:48 PM] Joe: 🤔 most recently the super liberal people here supported Bernie Sanders. I did too in 2016 because he wanted healthcare for everyone. But looking at his policies this time around, he had things like a federal jobs guarantee, which sounds wonderful. Making sure everyone who is capable of working has a job...but there are too many problems with it that no one ever dealt with....who is in charge? How much does everyone get paid? What if you don’t like the federal job you’ve been guaranteed? What happens when a president like Trump is in charge of the federal jobs guarantee and makes his workforce “build the wall”? What about the people that are not capable of working?
"

"
1631,"[5/15/20, 12:27:27 PM] Joe: The normal people come last. Basically I aligned very well with this politician named Andrew Yang this year. He was like my dream candidate hahaha. Very focused on working based of hard numbers/data and had actual solution oriented policies that would help average people. He wrote a book called The War on Normal People. Excellent book 📚
"
1632,"[5/15/20, 12:33:18 PM] Joe: That’s my duuuuuude! Hahaha
"
1633,"[5/15/20, 12:36:26 PM] Joe: It’s weird. The states can do their own rules to make things stricter but not more relaxed than the federal government. Technically with marijuana laws a lot of states are breaking federal law but the federal government has mostly stopped enforcement on stores running legally in states.
"
1634,"[5/15/20, 12:37:11 PM] Joe: Haha it’ll make more sense after the book
"
1635,"[5/15/20, 12:38:52 PM] Joe: I thought his ideas were kind of crazy at first but I researched them quite a bit and they would theoretically work well and give a lot of power to regular people
"
1636,"[5/15/20, 12:44:06 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 I’m fucking dead 💀
"
1637,"[5/15/20, 12:44:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
1638,"[5/15/20, 12:44:15 PM] Joe: Fuck
"
1639,"[5/15/20, 12:47:29 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be great. But if you read the book and learn about automation coming it looks like one of the only smart things to do. 
"
1640,"[5/15/20, 12:52:55 PM] Joe: It’s fine. The technology is there. Whether it’s Amazon or someone else it’s inevitable and should actually be desirable. But we need to make sure people have money even if they have no work. Then we can automate and be very happy about it.
"
1641,"[5/15/20, 12:54:02 PM] Joe: If people are scared of automation and job losses because they’ll have no money it will only slow us down as a society
"
1642,"[5/15/20, 12:55:09 PM] Joe: Haha cool. I don’t want to sound like a crazy person 😂 
"
1643,"[5/15/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Universal basic income. Income not tied to what you do for a living. It’s like this....in the US there is a disagreement about minimum wage. Some think it should go up, others say it would kill small businesses because only big businesses can afford that. I understand both sides. People need more money, small businesses can’t afford it. Universal basic income.
"
1644,"[5/15/20, 1:01:06 PM] Joe: You don’t. He would say, “we need to decouple human value from economic value and put the money directly in the people’s hands”
"
1645,"[5/15/20, 1:02:05 PM] Joe: Exactly. We should. I want that. I want the future where humans can do less tedious task and have more time for living. But they’ll need money to live
"
1646,"[5/15/20, 1:06:15 PM] Joe: And there will still be jobs and ways to move up the ladder in life but everyone will have at least a baseline of income to live from. 
"
1647,"[5/15/20, 1:09:03 PM] Joe: Alright I’ve said waaaaay too much hahahahaha
"
1648,"[5/15/20, 1:09:10 PM] Joe: Fuck yeah 😂
"
1649,"[5/15/20, 1:09:28 PM] Joe: Make America Think Harder 😂 MATH
"
1650,"[5/15/20, 1:09:39 PM] Joe: Told you that’s my dude
"
1651,"[5/15/20, 1:11:19 PM] Joe: No. We should destroy all jobs. Humans will create new better ones.
"
1652,"[5/15/20, 1:11:30 PM] Joe: Well. That’s my opinion hahaha
"
1653,"[5/15/20, 1:12:19 PM] Joe: But we should provide for everyone at the same time. You can’t create the next amazing thing if you work just to survive and barely even make it
"
1654,"[5/15/20, 1:15:12 PM] Joe: Hahaa this comes from the minds of the humans with more time to think. There will always be problems to solve and ways to make life better. Also, if there was a universal basic income, people can be secure in doing what they love. Even if it makes less money than you could survive on without the basic income.
"
1655,"[5/15/20, 1:15:47 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
"
1656,"[5/15/20, 1:16:48 PM] Joe: Haha I got very passionate about these ideas and studied them a lot. I spent a lot of time thinking about this 😂

"
1667,"[5/15/20, 1:27:51 PM] Joe: Seems like you like the blue and white houses so we’ll go with that haha
"
1668,"[5/15/20, 1:28:58 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I suppose
"
1669,"[5/15/20, 1:29:54 PM] Joe: Hahahahah damn stealing my color preferences and shit
"
1670,"[5/15/20, 1:30:08 PM] Joe: 🙄
"
1671,"[5/15/20, 1:32:11 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll learn about him while you learn about Andrew Yang
"
1672,"[5/15/20, 1:35:06 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s a necessary thing. Seems obvious especially now.
"
1673,"[5/15/20, 1:35:51 PM] Joe: Ok ok I like that
"
1674,"[5/15/20, 1:39:44 PM] Joe: A more equitable future for everyone basically. Sounds reasonable
"
1675,"[5/15/20, 1:40:21 PM] Joe: I’ll send you a hat 😂
"
1676,"[5/15/20, 1:43:18 PM] Joe: Damn y’all beat us to legalizing weed? Fuck I’m going to Uruguay hahah
"
1677,"[5/15/20, 1:43:30 PM] Joe: You can meet me there 😂
"
1678,"[5/15/20, 1:44:14 PM] Joe: But all of the other things are good as well. You should be proud. I’m embarrassed to be from America sometimes 🤦‍♂️
"
1679,"[5/15/20, 1:45:58 PM] Joe: Haha I figured that one out

"
1698,"[5/15/20, 3:45:08 PM] Joe: Mexican avocados are very expensive here. Cheap in California though. But the Hawaiian avocado you can get for free. Just find a tree somewhere or know someone that has some haha

1699,"[5/15/20, 3:45:31 PM] Joe: 😂
"
1700,"[5/15/20, 3:51:42 PM] Joe: This was me all day long when I worked in healthcare hahahah
"
1701,"[5/15/20, 3:53:33 PM] Joe: I worked in pharmacy and it felt like government approved drug dealing though haha especially in the area i worked. Lots of pain killers and stuff like that.

"
1703,"[5/15/20, 8:55:59 PM] Joe: Holaaa. buenos días! I just woke up from a nap haha confused as can be 😂

"
1712,"[5/16/20, 12:46:11 AM] Joe: Haha I like these. The pictures from Lore’s bed. A bed soooo far away 😂
"
1713,"[5/16/20, 12:48:32 AM] Joe: What do you use to sleep? Some ear plugs? Most birds don’t wake me, but there is one that is way too loud. It gets me every time. 
"
1714,"[5/16/20, 12:50:10 AM] Joe: Haha it’s you’re little travel companion.
"
1715,"[5/16/20, 12:51:35 AM] Joe: They have these all over here. Really big ones. Yours look well taken care of though. I know a bunch of chicks that got super into plants hahaha mostly my friends girlfriends but I see a lot of random plant related stuff because of that
"
1716,"[5/16/20, 12:52:22 AM] Joe: Haha I heard most but i definitely missed the weird dream part. Interesting 🤔
"
1717,"[5/16/20, 12:55:58 AM] Joe: Those last two things are cute. I forgot all about dream catchers haha. Very cool though.
"
1718,"[5/16/20, 12:57:39 AM] Joe: I don’t think I have any cool stuff I bring everywhere. I need to get some stuff like that.

"
1720,"[5/16/20, 1:01:26 AM] Joe: When I came to Hawaii I brought one suitcase full of clothes, my skateboard, and my computer. But all of that is replaceable non sentimental stuff.

"
1723,"[5/16/20, 1:06:39 AM] Joe: I thing the concept and culture of skateboarding is sentimental but the board itself not so much haha
"
1724,"[5/16/20, 1:07:15 AM] Joe: Oh shit you’re right! I forgot about that. Probably because I just got it. Alright. That’s my first item 😂 😂 A fucking paddington bear

"
1734,"[5/16/20, 1:51:07 AM] Joe: No son igual haha but close. You say them correct. No one would confuse it if you say it like that.
"
1735,"[5/16/20, 1:51:41 AM] Joe: I’m sure there are words like that in spanish. Some regular item that is super close to a bad word?
"
1736,"[5/16/20, 1:53:21 AM] Joe: Yeah they’re super similar. I’m not surprised either but it’s a good story haha
"

"
1738,"[5/16/20, 2:00:54 AM] Joe: Haha I understand. There are words in Spanish that are like that to me. I’ll get a whole different meaning from a sentence because I misheard a word or two 😂

1774,"[5/16/20, 2:55:20 AM] Joe: I’ll watch it now
"
1775,"[5/16/20, 3:03:42 AM] Joe: Damn I’m halfway through and this lady is already speaking hella languages at 25 hahaha. Boss lady
"
1776,"[5/16/20, 3:14:48 AM] Joe: lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el video del puño
"
1777,"[5/16/20, 3:15:56 AM] Joe: That lady is cool. And the guy knows a bunch of languages too. I’m trying to do that haha. We’ll see how it goes with spanish first haha
"
1778,"[5/16/20, 3:17:13 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s the best way to learn
"
1779,"[5/16/20, 3:19:33 AM] Joe: Haha okey. lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el primer video.
"
1780,"[5/16/20, 3:20:25 AM] Joe: True!
"
1781,"[5/16/20, 3:23:03 AM] Joe: Cool. Gracias. I’m just starting to watch the second video now. Is it about being introverted? I like this topic hahah I read a book called Introvert Power.
"
1782,"[5/16/20, 3:29:17 AM] Joe: Soooo yeah....I’m super introverted. And in the way he describes. That’s how the book explains it too. I’m drained by too many people and superficial relationships and energized by being alone or with someone I connect with on a deeper level. 
"
1783,"[5/16/20, 3:32:46 AM] Joe: Wait....why did you decide to send me that? 
"
1784,"[5/16/20, 3:40:57 AM] Joe: Yeah that video was relatable. I enjoy our balance for sure haha there’s something really nice about it that makes it fun
"
1785,"[5/16/20, 3:41:31 AM] Joe: You’re definitely a character haha. I can’t imagine you being very shy but that’s interesting to know.
"
1786,"[5/16/20, 3:44:06 AM] Joe: Don’t be sorry. Tell me everything
"
1787,"[5/16/20, 3:48:05 AM] Joe: Hahaha you have a way of connecting with the shy introverts. Must have some good vibes
"
1788,"[5/16/20, 3:52:18 AM] Joe: Send more thoughts my way whenever you want. I really do want to hear it all.
"
1789,"[5/16/20, 3:52:31 AM] Joe: But right now I’m tired haha so I’m going to bed
"
1790,"[5/16/20, 3:54:18 AM] Joe: I think we covered a lot of ground today hahah some good stuff 😂 
"
1791,"[5/16/20, 4:04:01 AM] Joe: Haha I understand.

"
1797,"[5/16/20, 11:35:07 AM] Joe: It was a good lesson though. She was telling me about how she speaks a different Spanish than they do in Mexico. Probably more like from Spain. She said it would be “Castellano” o “Castilian”

"
1805,"[5/16/20, 1:51:39 PM] Joe: My bad for leaving you a bunch of messages 🤗 had to send those videos though haha

1807,"[5/16/20, 2:15:17 PM] Joe: Hah yeah those notes are what we’ve been talking about. And then after the lesson she will tell me about how people in my family speak Spanish. She said my aunt and uncle are ok but they get lazy and don’t speak Spanish enough then lose it but apparently my dad is the best at speaking haha.
"
1808,"[5/16/20, 2:16:16 PM] Joe: She is trying to make me talk to him in spanish to practice. But for now we go over what we would say to each other in the morning. Greetings, about breakfast and coffee ahah, and today we talked about going for a walk and just what we would see
"
1809,"[5/16/20, 2:18:20 PM] Joe: It’s good practice. She talks to me really slow most of the time haha. It’s fun though, we talk for about an hour each morning to practice
"
1810,"[5/16/20, 2:21:17 PM] Joe: We started a few days ago. I usually only speak to her in English
"
1811,"[5/16/20, 2:22:20 PM] Joe: He’ll be the last to know. Unless someone tells him haha
"
1812,"[5/16/20, 2:24:33 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
1813,"[5/16/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: 📝
"
1814,"[5/16/20, 2:26:49 PM] Joe: So the scared thing...she was telling me “no tengas miedo de la pronounciación o tu no aprenderá” 
"
1815,"[5/16/20, 2:28:30 PM] Joe: Haha sorry I thought I told you 🤔 
"
1816,"[5/16/20, 2:38:01 PM] Joe: Mierda
"
1817,"[5/16/20, 2:39:46 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t mind making mistakes with her, she just corrects me and we continue. And it has definitely been fun mispronouncing words with you. I was laughing too much trying to pronounce words yesterday haha

"

"
1825,"[5/16/20, 3:07:31 PM] Joe: Put them on your list
"
1826,"[5/16/20, 3:09:09 PM] Joe: Hahahah so funny the first one. I love it. The last one you nailed it though. Perfect
"
1827,"[5/16/20, 3:11:54 PM] Joe: I like the first one. If only I could save it hahaha
"
1828,"[5/16/20, 3:14:57 PM] Joe: Haha you got it super fast. It was good by the end
"
1829,"[5/16/20, 3:19:23 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it sounds “ea” sounds like spanish “i”. And the “i” sometimes sounds like spanish “e” but sometimes sound like the word “ay”
"
1830,"[5/16/20, 3:20:36 PM] Joe: English is hard to learn I’ve heard
"
1831,"[5/16/20, 3:21:29 PM] Joe: Because it doesn’t make sense. Spanish has a lot of ways to say things but mostly follows a smaller set of rules than English.
"
1832,"[5/16/20, 3:21:47 PM] Joe: Hahahah
"
1833,"[5/16/20, 3:23:05 PM] Joe: Our conversations are kind of weird but it’s interesting. Learning about the differences directly from someone across the globe

"
1842,"[5/16/20, 3:44:46 PM] Joe: I thought for a second you love the idea of kicking me into a pond hahaha
"
1843,"[5/16/20, 3:45:49 PM] Joe: Maybe save that for when you get really mad at me. 
"
1844,"[5/16/20, 3:49:00 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah for sure. You can be honest. If you have a lot of passion when you’re angry that’s ok. I would rather have honesty and learn to work with the kind of person you really are than to have you try and hide it

"
1859,"[5/16/20, 4:47:38 PM] Joe: Aah yeah corny/cheesy same meaning in English when you use it that way. But ok sounds good, prepare your questions. I’ll try to keep my answer short.
"

"
1864,"[5/16/20, 5:04:06 PM] Joe: Aw I Ike that haha. I might get stuck in your dream catcher though 😊
"
1865,"[5/16/20, 5:04:50 PM] Joe: I like that**

"
1874,"[5/17/20, 3:43:07 AM] Joe: Now I’m watching about analysis paralysis again 😂
"
1875,"[5/17/20, 3:43:39 AM] Joe: 😮
"
1876,"[5/17/20, 3:45:19 AM] Joe: You get an A+ for that lesson. I don’t even need the audio hahaha
"
1877,"[5/17/20, 3:45:58 AM] Joe: But I’ll take it if you want to send it 😆
"
1878,"[5/17/20, 3:48:36 AM] Joe: Sounded verrrrry good hahaha
"
1879,"[5/17/20, 3:50:03 AM] Joe: Much better than when I say it in spanish. Shit, it sounds better coming from you in English than me in English 😂
"
1880,"[5/17/20, 3:52:42 AM] Joe: Pfffff
"
1881,"[5/17/20, 3:54:22 AM] Joe: I’m just shy hahaha It’s not a phrase I would use often 😂 
"
1882,"[5/17/20, 3:56:20 AM] Joe: Haha that probably sounds weird. But I just mean you sound good when you say it
"
1883,"[5/17/20, 3:57:59 AM] Joe: Haha sorry, I wasn’t trying to imply that you do
"
1884,"‎[5/17/20, 4:04:57 AM] Joe: ‎image omitted
"
1885,"[5/17/20, 4:10:10 AM] Joe: Haha dude you have no idea how bad the US has been with all this do you?
"
1886,"[5/17/20, 4:12:17 AM] Joe: We basically fucked the whole response and it’s been like this for most of the time with people not listening. But in different places across the country at different times.
"
1887,"[5/17/20, 4:12:23 AM] Joe: Then we have weird enforcement where police will patrol poor neighborhoods and keep them on a much more serious lockdown than the rich neighborhoods
"
1888,"[5/17/20, 4:14:03 AM] Joe: It’s the worst. Especially in places like New York
"
1889,"[5/17/20, 4:15:12 AM] Joe: Yeah but the police let the rich gather in their parks and literally beat and arrest the poor for being outside in their neighborhoods
"
1890,"[5/17/20, 4:16:21 AM] Joe: It’s so weird to see a video of cops assaulting someone for being outside without a mask...instead of maybe just giving them a mask
"
1891,"[5/17/20, 4:16:47 AM] Joe: It doesn’t make sense cause now there are a bunch of cops touching this person to arrest them
"
1892,"[5/17/20, 4:17:10 AM] Joe: They should be distancing themselves not touching people. Shits crazy
"
1893,"[5/17/20, 4:17:38 AM] Joe: True
"
1894,"[5/17/20, 4:20:20 AM] Joe: Hahaha
"
1895,"[5/17/20, 4:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s what made one of the videos of a cop arresting someone for not having a mask so ridiculous. A few of the officers were wearing there mask like that haha
"
1896,"[5/17/20, 4:23:01 AM] Joe: It’s impossible to get 100% of the humans to believe it all and to actively participate in keeping everyone safe. Some people just don’t trust sources of authority telling them what to do
"
1897,"[5/17/20, 4:27:33 AM] Joe: Yeah the more we have stuff like that picture, the longer it will take to go to normal
"
1898,"[5/17/20, 4:28:42 AM] Joe: Hopefully there are more people doing the right thing than the wrong thing. Around here most wear their mask and keep their distance. Beaches are mostly empty but I think they are starting to open them this week.
"
1899,"[5/17/20, 4:29:32 AM] Joe: Oh and tell me what you thought about the video. I watched it again hahaha I forgot how old that video is
"
1900,"[5/17/20, 4:34:10 AM] Joe: Yeah it seems a little weirder being in a bigger city. It’ll be an adjustment going back to California. There are a lot of people in the Bay Area.
"
1901,"[5/17/20, 4:35:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I especially liked the medicine story. Doctors giving the patients the choice even though the doctor has the knowledge and the way medications are marketed
"
1902,"[5/17/20, 4:37:30 AM] Joe: I don’t know....and I only have 3 weeks to find out. I might have a friend I can stay with if I can’t find anything.
"
1903,"[5/17/20, 4:39:59 AM] Joe: 🤔 when I pick something I do a lot of research if it’s an expensive item. 
"
1904,"[5/17/20, 4:41:37 AM] Joe: Usually I just get the same thing every time once I find something I like. Then I don’t have to choose
"
1905,"[5/17/20, 4:49:08 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m going to bed soon. But um...just deciding what to do with my life hahaha
"
1906,"[5/17/20, 4:49:51 AM] Joe: Like my decision where to live, who to be, what things do I want to be able to say I’ve done when my life is over. The hard stuff haha

"
1915,"[5/17/20, 1:51:01 PM] Joe: No problem. I was out too, getting some sun
"
1916,"[5/17/20, 1:55:10 PM] Joe: Haha with the scissors still in hand. Did you find those and cut them?
"
1917,"[5/17/20, 1:56:43 PM] Joe: Haha I’m going to have to listen to that a bunch of times to get the whole thing but don’t translate it. I’ll use it to practice haha
"
1918,"[5/17/20, 2:05:10 PM] Joe: Hahaha so I got the part about your friend and the nickname 😂 and that you went to see your friend and went for a long walk with the dog. The dog is super good? Haha
"
1919,"[5/17/20, 2:07:00 PM] Joe: And you are getting a lot of flowers in nature because there are no gardeners hahah. Very nice.
"
1920,"[5/17/20, 2:08:35 PM] Joe: Sweet. There are still a bunch of words I miss or don’t understand but I can get barely enough to make a story in my head about what you say 😂
"
1921,"[5/17/20, 3:10:50 PM] Joe: Yeah that’ll be good. Enjoy dinner. I’m waiting for “Lahaina noon” where the sun is directly overhead and vertical objects have no shadow.
"
1922,"[5/17/20, 3:13:52 PM] Joe: Hmm I don’t have a link in spanish but I have this Wikipedia link

"
1938,"[5/17/20, 4:49:50 PM] Joe: Hahaha you would probably enjoy not being able to understand me. Just nod and go “mhmm” or “no” and see what happens 😂
"

1944,"[5/17/20, 5:00:15 PM] Joe: If I do it’s not in a bad way. Don’t second guess how you’re talking to me...I think everything you’ve said has been fine
"
1945,"[5/17/20, 5:01:39 PM] Joe: If there is something I don’t like I’ll let you know. It’s not a big deal. But like I said, so far so good
"
1946,"[5/17/20, 5:10:20 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t know what i would do 😂 
"
1947,"[5/17/20, 5:11:50 PM] Joe: So I would probably joke about whatever compliment you give me then compliment you I guess 🤔 
"
1948,"[5/17/20, 5:14:26 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck
"
1949,"[5/17/20, 5:14:39 PM] Joe: Well what do normal people do?? Am I weird for that?
"
1950,"[5/17/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Haha alright if you say so. I’ll just keep being my weird self since it seems to be working fine
"
1951,"[5/17/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: I wish you could just have subtitles everywhere you went because I can understand you so much better with subtitles 😂 😂
"
1952,"[5/17/20, 5:24:26 PM] Joe: So you can meet me sooner and I’ll understand you. You would have a little screen that shows subtitles for everything you say and you bring it everywhere hahah 
"
1953,"[5/17/20, 5:25:40 PM] Joe: But I’m just kidding. I’m figuring this shit out. Going to be sooo good at spanish. Just give it time.
"
1954,"[5/17/20, 5:32:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ll be ok with that 😂
"
1955,"[5/17/20, 5:34:59 PM] Joe: Mimes have excellent communication skills. Most communication is done with body language and nobody communicates with the body better than mimes haha
"
1956,"[5/17/20, 5:35:41 PM] Joe: Also, less of a chance for me to say something stupid that way 😆
"
1957,"[5/17/20, 5:40:58 PM] Joe: Oook talk to later. Buenas noches

1961,"[5/18/20, 10:57:48 AM] Joe: Hahaha whaaaat? I just got off the phone before I read this. I’ll ask tomorrow. I’ve never heard of this though 😂 
"
1962,"[5/18/20, 10:59:36 AM] Joe: Haha dammit I just listened to the audio too. I’ll say it tomorrow after you tell me what it means haha
"
1963,"[5/18/20, 11:02:18 AM] Joe: Aaah ok. Yeah she was saying not everyone uses the word tuco but she uses it a lot
"
1964,"[5/18/20, 11:04:13 AM] Joe: Sounds like something I could get into. I’m trying to attract money and good things haha
"
1965,"[5/18/20, 11:05:14 AM] Joe: Oh this is random but I got so bored yesterday I took a personality test hahaha

"
1969,"[5/18/20, 11:11:50 AM] Joe: You* can take it
"
1970,"[5/18/20, 11:14:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha fuck. More like I say them so badly that you can’t understand hahah shit
"
1971,"[5/18/20, 11:16:24 AM] Joe: Yeah. My brain was just working slow today. She would say a long sentence to me and my brain would stop listening halfway through cause I’m still translating the beginning in my head.
"
1972,"[5/18/20, 11:19:18 AM] Joe: Hahaha

1979,"[5/18/20, 11:27:02 AM] Joe: Not much. Today was bad haha. We just went over greeting in the morning and a pretend walk again.
"
1980,"[5/18/20, 11:29:29 AM] Joe: She was telling me a lot of learning strategies today. Like put stickers with the spanish word for the item on things around the house. She said watch tv and movies with spanish subtitles so I can see what they are saying and train my ear better even if I don’t necessarily understand
"
1981,"[5/18/20, 11:30:15 AM] Joe: Listen closely to the movies or shows and write down words I don’t understand and look them up in the dictionary
"
1982,"[5/18/20, 11:35:08 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’m going to tell her. I just don’t know when 😂 
"
1983,"[5/18/20, 11:35:16 AM] Joe: Even my family
"
1984,"[5/18/20, 11:37:34 AM] Joe: Haha I doubt you’re telling anyone about me 😂

1986,"[5/18/20, 11:40:26 AM] Joe: I’ve mentioned you to my two closest friends but that’s it haha.
"
1987,"[5/18/20, 11:41:02 AM] Joe: Their minds were blown. They couldn’t imagine it 😂
"
1988,"[5/18/20, 11:46:31 AM] Joe: Hahaha they wouldn’t talk you out of it?? You must not have told them enough about me yet 😂
"
1989,"[5/18/20, 11:50:18 AM] Joe: Mostly “Whaaaaat!? Hahaha, you’re always doing something hella cutty” which is kind of like saying that I’m always doing stuff without many knowing. And they talked about how I’m always doing the opposite of what they’re doing in life haha ever since high school
"
1990,"[5/18/20, 11:51:17 AM] Joe: But they were stoked on it. A little concerned that I might leave the Bay Area for good but they know wherever I go they’re welcome to visit so it’s bittersweet I guess
"
1991,"[5/18/20, 12:01:02 PM] Joe: Well when I first told them about you I said I was considering trying to see you. Maybe in Spain. They all traveled internationally without me a few years back. I was too busy working to go. Now it’s the opposite, I have time to travel and they’re all very busy. 
"
1992,"[5/18/20, 12:01:29 PM] Joe: Now I’m a mess and they’re all clean cut haha. I don’t know. I’m just always doing my own thing
"
1993,"[5/18/20, 12:04:01 PM] Joe: I must take some kind of pride in being “different” because I’ve always been this way haha.
"
1994,"[5/18/20, 12:04:08 PM] Joe: Basically Hahahaha
"
1995,"[5/18/20, 12:04:33 PM] Joe: I didn’t even notice until my friends pointed it out though
"
1996,"[5/18/20, 12:06:55 PM] Joe: For sure. Especially these dudes. I’ve been friends with them since I was 12 haha so they know me well and can tell me things I don’t notice about my own personality

1998,"[5/18/20, 12:15:08 PM] Joe: Haha yeah but we’ll play later! The sound makes it better for sure
"
1999,"[5/18/20, 12:16:06 PM] Joe: The mini detail will make the project look much better in the eyes of a recruiter or potential client if I show it to them. It still feels unfinished to me. I’m working on adding the gifs next hahaha
"
2000,"[5/18/20, 12:16:08 PM] Joe: We need them
"
2001,"[5/18/20, 12:16:49 PM] Joe: I’m learning so much in quarantine 😂
"
2002,"[5/18/20, 12:31:16 PM] Joe: I’ll send you videos of boring California hahah. I’ll be back soon to send more though....or you can just come here 😂

"
2007,"[5/18/20, 1:28:41 PM] Joe: Aaaah I just spent 25 minutes trying one trick hahaha.

2008,"[5/18/20, 1:28:53 PM] Joe: Didn’t get it 😞

"
2014,"[5/18/20, 2:59:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I guess I’m a little off today

2030,"[5/18/20, 11:52:47 PM] Joe: I can still see it until I close the game on my end.
"
2031,"[5/18/20, 11:54:17 PM] Joe: Oh yeah making the little preview instead of the text showing up in the box took forever haha. Had to make the preview appear, then add a button to cancel if you don’t want to use the gif, and make sure if you choose another gif it replaces the current one and doesn’t add another preview
"
2032,"[5/18/20, 11:54:41 PM] Joe: It was a little complicated and frustrating but I got it. 1/3 today 😂
"
2033,"[5/18/20, 11:55:53 PM] Joe: Oh but if someone else joins they can’t see any chat that was written before they entered. Or if you rejoin, you won’t be able to see it. But it never gets deleted for anyone that stays in the game
"
2034,"[5/19/20, 12:00:33 AM] Joe: No cause I’m not in the room now. So if I join i see a blank chat. And actually the room will be deleted when the last player is gone
"
2035,"[5/19/20, 12:02:25 AM] Joe: Yeah it’ll be another thing to tack onto the resumé so that’s good. Plus it’ll make playing way more fun 😂
"
2036,"[5/19/20, 12:02:46 AM] Joe: I sent a video to my friends, they were stoked on the new feature
"
2037,"[5/19/20, 12:03:32 AM] Joe: But yeah it’s kind of crazy to think about how everything we use on the internet had to be made in a similar way. Just a bunch of code
"
2038,"[5/19/20, 12:05:53 AM] Joe: Haha ok
"
2039,"[5/19/20, 12:06:20 AM] Joe: Let’s play

"
2042,"[5/19/20, 12:15:56 AM] Joe: Hmmmmmm

"
2047,"[5/19/20, 12:19:17 AM] Joe: I could probably do both. Alright...added to the list
"
2048,"[5/19/20, 12:23:13 AM] Joe: I don’t know hahah. You have access to GIPHY’s whole library of gifs. Probably the same that this app uses.
"
2049,"[5/19/20, 12:23:31 AM] Joe: Facebook just bought GIPHY this week and the own WhatsApp
"
2050,"[5/19/20, 12:24:57 AM] Joe: Hahaha i wonder what kind of gifs your mom likes? 😂 
"
2051,"[5/19/20, 12:28:35 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good. I need to teach my mom to use them. I’m interested to see what she would send.
"
2052,"[5/19/20, 12:36:56 AM] Joe: Hahahah “mister bean” “en google?” Hahaha
"
2053,"[5/19/20, 12:38:23 AM] Joe: You need to teach her how to find the hidden gems 💎 I’ve been getting good with the gifs from talking to you 😂
"
2054,"[5/19/20, 12:47:54 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good to know. I got points for the good gifs 😂 
"
2055,"[5/19/20, 12:53:30 AM] Joe: Haha hair and pants are looking wild. I love it 😂
"
2056,"[5/19/20, 1:18:20 AM] Joe: The skateboarding from earlier today wiped me out. I should’ve taken a nap.
"
2057,"[5/19/20, 1:18:36 AM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if i pass out out of nowhere today haha
"
2058,"[5/19/20, 1:18:43 AM] Joe: Mmmm
"
2059,"[5/19/20, 1:21:53 AM] Joe: Haha I like the look very much. Nice and comfortable
"
2060,"[5/19/20, 1:25:23 AM] Joe: Haha alright. Well I guess I’ll lay down. I’ll probably fall asleep instantly, I can feel it coming haha.
"
2061,"[5/19/20, 1:26:31 AM] Joe: Have a good day, I hope the course goes well for you! 
"
2062,"[5/19/20, 1:30:18 AM] Joe: Haha cool I’ll put it on
"
2063,"[5/19/20, 1:30:56 AM] Joe: That’s me. But I’m not like super smart or anything hahah. Sounds cool. I’ll watch it
"
2064,"[5/19/20, 1:35:23 AM] Joe: Same! I LOVE learning but college still was not the right choice for me and I’m glad i didn’t go. I would probably be in so much debt haha. Instead I have a nice little savings 👍
"
2065,"[5/19/20, 1:36:18 AM] Joe: So far it’s working out. I know a lot of people that went to college but aren’t using their degrees in the end. 
"
2066,"[5/19/20, 1:42:03 AM] Joe: It only cost this dude $5,000 to stay in Argentina for 4 months. I should do that hahah
"
2067,"[5/19/20, 1:46:12 AM] Joe: Yeah web development has many self taught people. It’s all about what you can do, so portfolios and projects are important. 
"
2068,"[5/19/20, 1:47:26 AM] Joe: Hmm well I’m pretty flexible on lifestyle haha I don’t need much.

2071,"[5/19/20, 1:51:36 AM] Joe: I need to think about the destination? Cause I’m pretty sure it would just be wherever you are Hahahaha
"
2072,"[5/19/20, 1:57:14 AM] Joe: Hahah sure.

"
2079,"[5/19/20, 12:30:20 PM] Joe: Ok all done. Today the main thing I learned it the importance of the apostrophe haha.
"
2080,"[5/19/20, 12:31:32 PM] Joe: Nelly told me about her friend that would get mad because people would write “Feliz ano nuevo” on Facebook without using the “ñ” hahaha

"
2086,"[5/19/20, 1:52:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha there is a name for the dudes like me with the gold chain and stuff out here. I forgot what it was though
"
2087,"[5/19/20, 1:57:33 PM] Joe: I’ll tell you what it is when I remember or I’ll ask my sister. I got this chain from Nelly probably 15 years ago. It has a pendant that is in the shape of Peru and says “PERU” across it. 
"
2088,"[5/19/20, 2:08:32 PM] Joe: Haha yeah she got it on a trip to Peru too so I really like it.
"
2089,"[5/19/20, 2:08:49 PM] Joe: I’m going to take a shower really quick and I’ll redo the audio 🚿
"
2090,"[5/19/20, 2:41:16 PM] Joe: Haha all the pictures of me at that age are mostly me in sports uniforms. Like baseball and soccer. The baseball ones are funny cause I wore a helmet that made my head look huge 😂
"
2091,"[5/19/20, 2:43:26 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
"
2092,"[5/19/20, 2:43:59 PM] Joe: Dammit I always start talking before it records

"
2099,"[5/19/20, 3:13:15 PM] Joe: Oh and I’ll send pictures of mini Joe when I get back to California but you’ll have to send me mini Lore pictures in return 😂
"
2100,"[5/19/20, 3:21:38 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 hahahah

"
2103,"[5/19/20, 3:23:36 PM] Joe: Tiny Lore...big dog
"
2104,"[5/19/20, 3:24:32 PM] Joe: That’s definitely a 90s jacket hahaha great photos. I literally have zero with me or on my phone so you have to wait a few weeks to see mine
"
2105,"[5/19/20, 3:26:11 PM] Joe: Hahaa always with the love for dogs 🐕
"
2106,"[5/19/20, 3:36:57 PM] Joe: You’ll be disappointed with my pictures when I send them. I don’t think I have a lot of good ones. I’ll have to ask my parents to see if they’re hiding any.
"
2107,"[5/19/20, 3:38:48 PM] Joe: So, right now I’m using these things to try and hear words better....music you sent me, la casa de Papel, and I’m watching a bunch of “Casi Creativo” videos hahaha
"
2108,"[5/19/20, 3:43:35 PM] Joe: Haha what?

"
2151,"[5/20/20, 3:08:53 PM] Joe: But I would come see you. Definitely. Whenever you want me to
"
2152,"[5/20/20, 3:12:06 PM] Joe: Haha ok. I’m really serious that I’ll make it happen if you ask for real. Just saying

2154,"[5/20/20, 3:15:43 PM] Joe: Alriiiight. I’ll actually start looking into the logistics of making it happen. Of course it will be after the pandemic and when I have my passport haha but it shouldn’t be too difficult to make it happen

2158,"[5/20/20, 3:19:18 PM] Joe: My dream life haha
"
2159,"[5/20/20, 3:21:39 PM] Joe: Haha definitely chickens, maybe a goat, and dogs. From there it depends how much space I have. I also want to grow a lot of food
"
2160,"[5/20/20, 3:23:36 PM] Joe: But how many of everything depends on the space. I still need to save more before I can start on that but I’ve been working towards a life like that

"
2165,"[5/20/20, 3:26:49 PM] Joe: Aaaah I’m just kidding though. I just think it’s so strange how we want such similar lives
"
2166,"[5/20/20, 3:27:26 PM] Joe: And somehow you decided to talk to me from across the world even though I’m pretty difficult to talk to in the beginning
"
2167,"[5/20/20, 3:28:31 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
2168,"[5/20/20, 3:29:07 PM] Joe: I just don’t know what to think hahah. Is life really full of such serendipity?

"
2173,"[5/20/20, 3:38:44 PM] Joe: Stop being perfect hahaha
"
2174,"[5/20/20, 3:39:14 PM] Joe: Yeah I understand. You have to do what you have to do to get by. But you have the right goal haha
"
2175,"[5/20/20, 3:48:06 PM] Joe: Those are some wonderful dreams. I know I’m just some random dude on the internet or whatever but I’d be really happy to work together to make that happen. Team work makes the dream work haha
"
2176,"[5/20/20, 3:50:31 PM] Joe: But like you said...enough 💭 hahaha it just sounds so nice though
"
2177,"[5/20/20, 3:51:29 PM] Joe: I think it’s fair to admit I’m pretty random haha
"
2178,"[5/20/20, 3:52:59 PM] Joe: I mean my plan is basically what you described. Maybe I didn’t think it would be so many dogs and cats but “the more the merrier” as they say haha
"
2179,"[5/20/20, 3:53:15 PM] Joe: Small house. Lots of land. Animals and nature
"
2180,"[5/20/20, 3:57:14 PM] Joe: Haha wellll I really want my small house to be cute and inconspicuous. Look like a very old style, made by hand, but on the inside it will be like a smart house hahah. And I want to grow mangoes 🥭 and avocados 🥑 possibly coffee if the location is right for it. I also want a garden full of variety. Basically anything I can make grow well in the climate my house ends up in. There is a big difference between being up higher and being near the shore in terms of climate.
"
2181,"[5/20/20, 3:57:39 PM] Joe: Most likely off grid with solar
"
2182,"[5/20/20, 3:57:58 PM] Joe: And a catchment for the water
"
2183,"[5/20/20, 3:59:11 PM] Joe: I’m trying to think of anything else 🤔
"
2184,"[5/20/20, 4:00:54 PM] Joe: I don’t know. Just a simple lifestyle I suppose. Not much too it but it will still take a lot of work.
"
2185,"[5/20/20, 4:03:18 PM] Joe: That would complete the dream for me so yes you can haha
"
2186,"[5/20/20, 4:07:01 PM] Joe: I better start saving more money 😂
"
2187,"[5/20/20, 4:09:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha you don’t understand. I’ve been imagining this for a long time. I actually have been putting money away to make this dream real for me. I’m not going to take no for an answer from the world on this one.

2221,"[5/20/20, 4:54:12 PM] Joe: Aaaah
"
2222,"[5/20/20, 4:54:33 PM] Joe: I have
"
2223,"[5/20/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: I am sort of haha. The same way I’m not talkative if you don’t know me, I’m not super sexual unless I really feel for you.
"
2224,"[5/20/20, 4:57:09 PM] Joe: Also I’ve never had to express my sexuality from a distance because I’ve never been in this situation
"
2225,"[5/20/20, 4:57:28 PM] Joe: No one has ever made me really have feelings for them from across the world haha
"
2226,"[5/20/20, 5:02:54 PM] Joe: Hahah sorry if I’m disappointing you here. It’s just who I am though. If I was near you, you would be getting 100% of my affection. You’ve gotten a lot further than most 😂
"
2227,"[5/20/20, 5:04:33 PM] Joe: Ok. What about you? I’m assuming you’re a little more of a sexual personality than me haha
"
2228,"[5/20/20, 5:05:35 PM] Joe: Mostly because I’m shy as fuck not because I think something about what you do hahaha
"
2229,"[5/20/20, 5:09:40 PM] Joe: Haha sorry about that. For you and any boys in Madrid that have their eye on you 😂
"
2230,"[5/20/20, 5:10:33 PM] Joe: I know what you mean. By this point I would usually have to just express through action haha
"
2231,"[5/20/20, 5:13:56 PM] Joe: Hmm yeah that’s unfortunate haha fuck
"
2232,"[5/20/20, 5:15:42 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s true. I’ll try to be as open, honest, and comfortable about it with you as I can be
"
2233,"[5/20/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Not at all. I love sex hahahah but only with a certain person or I can’t even enjoy anything
"
2234,"[5/20/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: Definitely not asexual. Just.....really picky haha
"
2235,"[5/20/20, 5:25:21 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised. I mean, a lot of people can sleep with people they’re only physically attracted to, even if they don’t have much of a connection and enjoy it a lot. I can’t do that.
"
2236,"[5/20/20, 5:25:51 PM] Joe: Don’t worry. I would be all over you hahaha
"
2237,"[5/20/20, 5:31:47 PM] Joe: I really like you. I don’t know how to make that clear without seeming weird hahaha 
"
2238,"[5/20/20, 5:32:57 PM] Joe: I would definitely be all over you. And I wouldn’t let you go. 
"
2239,"[5/20/20, 5:35:47 PM] Joe: Haha it was a good video
"
2240,"[5/20/20, 5:39:23 PM] Joe: That’s fine. Don’t need to get married then, but you’ll end up with me for a long ass time haha
"
2241,"[5/20/20, 5:41:46 PM] Joe: Ok I’m sorry to keep you up with my crazy dreams of being together hahaha 
"
2242,"[5/20/20, 5:42:37 PM] Joe: Good cause I’m going to make it happen so I don’t want you to be too surprised
"
2243,"[5/20/20, 5:44:23 PM] Joe: Haha you make me excited when you talk about seeing me, sorry 😂
"
2244,"[5/20/20, 5:44:34 PM] Joe: Ok well you get some sleep then
"
2245,"[5/20/20, 5:45:32 PM] Joe: I’ll talk to you tomorrow I’m sure haha

"
2293,"[5/22/20, 1:31:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha shit
"
2294,"[5/22/20, 1:32:27 AM] Joe: Just at the beginning. Takes a few tries for me to get it.
"

"
2310,"[5/22/20, 2:15:43 AM] Joe: Haha same. Ever since I saw that video. Sorry for giving you the same thoughts hahaha

2313,"[5/22/20, 2:34:08 AM] Joe: Haha yeah you need to delete things you don’t need or transfer them to cloud storage or an external hard drive.
"
2314,"[5/22/20, 2:34:50 AM] Joe: You can put things on Dropbox or something similar and delete them from your computer or buy something like a Samsung SSD and transfer things to that
"
2315,"[5/22/20, 2:35:48 AM] Joe: Hmmmm
"

"
2317,"[5/22/20, 2:43:03 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll look at it more tomorrow. It might also be that you don’t have enough memory/RAM which is different than the long term storage in those drives. 
"
2318,"‎[5/22/20, 2:45:06 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
2319,"[5/22/20, 2:46:17 AM] Joe: Specs look pretty good. Hmm, it only is running slow when you use that 3d program?
"
2320,"[5/22/20, 2:47:32 AM] Joe: Or all the time? If it’s only with that program, it’s probably just a super memory intensive program.
"
2321,"[5/22/20, 2:48:14 AM] Joe: I’m thinking that program is probably just insane with the amount of resources it needs. 3D rendering takes a lot of memory
"
2322,"[5/22/20, 2:50:03 AM] Joe: I have to see if that laptop allows for you to upgrade the ram but you can go from the 16GB you have to 32GB and that might help
"
2323,"[5/22/20, 2:52:31 AM] Joe: Yeah because that space that’s full is the long term storage. But i think the problem is with the short term memory/RAM
"
2324,"[5/22/20, 2:53:19 AM] Joe: 30GB remaining right? Not 30GB RAM?
"
2325,"[5/22/20, 2:53:39 AM] Joe: A good way to check would be to open the task manager when you’re using the program and see what it says
"
2326,"‎[5/22/20, 2:54:48 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
2327,"[5/22/20, 2:56:34 AM] Joe: Well it might not look like it’s in there but If you have any photos and videos they’re usually on the C drive. Just hard to find.
"
2328,"[5/22/20, 2:57:54 AM] Joe: Open the task manager when you have the program open and see if you are using 100% of the memory. Also try not to have google chrome open while using the program cause chrome uses a lot of memory. Maybe try Firefox
"
2329,"[5/22/20, 2:59:28 AM] Joe: Hahaha Ok now I really think it’s the RAM 😂
"
2330,"[5/22/20, 2:59:45 AM] Joe: Delete
"
2331,"[5/22/20, 3:00:11 AM] Joe: Control + alt + delete then open task manager to check on memory usuage
"
2332,"[5/22/20, 3:00:20 AM] Joe: Usage*
"
2333,"[5/22/20, 3:01:39 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll help tomorrow. I’m going to have to actually read up and make sure you get the right stuff. But it’s most likely not enough memory haha
"
2334,"[5/22/20, 3:04:27 AM] Joe: Hmmm only 51% usage on your memory. Keep that open and if it starts going slow look at it and see if it is at or above 100%

"
2345,"[5/22/20, 3:16:45 AM] Joe: Shit it’s working. I was half asleep then i started researching your computer 😂
"
2346,"[5/22/20, 3:16:56 AM] Joe: I’m a fucking nerd

2361,"[5/22/20, 12:46:12 PM] Joe: Ok haha sounds good. There was some funny stuff today. Like “sordo” I learned because Boom Boom is supposedly deaf but he can hear Nelly from across the house when she says “food is ready” hahaha
"
2362,"[5/22/20, 12:47:02 PM] Joe: We were talking about it in context to a relationship. So one partner saying it to the other.
"
2363,"[5/22/20, 12:48:32 PM] Joe: Mi abuelo
"
2364,"[5/22/20, 12:51:07 PM] Joe: Nelly was talking about her and BoomBoom. We were talking about how they joke around a lot but she has never been offended by him and he has never been offended by here. Because they respect each other.
"
2365,"[5/22/20, 12:51:21 PM] Joe: By her*
"
2366,"[5/22/20, 12:53:14 PM] Joe: Haha boom boom es mi abuelo, Nelly es mi abuela.
"
2367,"[5/22/20, 12:55:07 PM] Joe: Oooh like why do I call him that? I don’t know haha. That’s what everyone in our family had always called him. 
"

"
2372,"[5/22/20, 1:29:31 PM] Joe: Hahaha siii. Sordo is like BoomBoom. Can’t hear. But zudro is like me, left-handed haha
"
2373,"[5/22/20, 1:36:07 PM] Joe: I’m not sure hahah. Doctor says he can’t hear. And he supposedly doesn’t hear or mishears things often. But Nelly was saying she’ll tell him “food is ready” in a normal voice,  not even yelling, and he will come from across the house 😂
"
2374,"[5/22/20, 1:36:14 PM] Joe: So she said he is faking it hahaha
"
2375,"[5/22/20, 1:37:40 PM] Joe: Haha me and Gastón living as left handed people in a right handed world 😂
"
2376,"[5/22/20, 1:38:50 PM] Joe: Sí, audiencia selectiva jaja
"
2377,"[5/22/20, 1:39:59 PM] Joe: I wonder if he had the problem of smearing everything he wrote when he was younger too haha. I used to hate that. After writing an essay my hand would be covered in ink 😂 hated it
"
2378,"[5/22/20, 1:41:20 PM] Joe: Haha even with the left hand....how? Hahahaha
"
2379,"[5/22/20, 1:50:25 PM] Joe: Hahahaha so good 😂
"
2380,"[5/22/20, 1:50:37 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
2381,"[5/22/20, 1:51:27 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll have to try writing to you right handed. I’m leaving to drive to the north side of the island in a second though so I’ll send that later. Going to a beach

"
2398,"[5/23/20, 4:28:46 AM] Joe: Ooh so interviewing for another roommate? That’s cool. I hope you find someone chill haha
"
2399,"[5/23/20, 4:30:59 AM] Joe: I shouldn’t have slept for so long. I messed up haha.

"
2401,"[5/23/20, 4:38:03 AM] Joe: Yeah probably I’ll fall asleep again soon. Or...hopefully haha

"
2404,"[5/23/20, 4:42:38 AM] Joe: Kind of makes me wonder how long my hair would be if it was straight. It feels like it’s barely getting longer cause it just gets curlier haha
"
2405,"[5/23/20, 4:48:39 AM] Joe: Hahaha it just bounces back when I pull it. It’s so weird 😆 
"
2406,"[5/23/20, 4:50:17 AM] Joe: Hahaha
"
2407,"[5/23/20, 4:50:29 AM] Joe: Nice. Ok I go back to sleep now hahaha

"
2410,"[5/23/20, 5:02:00 AM] Joe: Well I was going to go to sleep but now I’m interested to know about this haha
"
2411,"[5/23/20, 5:05:12 AM] Joe: Hmm ok. Yeah some brothers would be pretty cool haha

"
2413,"[5/23/20, 5:06:48 AM] Joe: That’s cool. I’d be super stoked on a boy too, that would be the best. But I would be really happy either way
"
2414,"[5/23/20, 5:07:52 AM] Joe: Yeah you’re explaining fine. That sounds very nice
"
2415,"[5/23/20, 5:16:46 AM] Joe: Haha don’t worry. Tell me more. Tell me anything you think of
"
2416,"[5/23/20, 5:17:16 AM] Joe: Yeah this makes sense. I see where you’re coming from. I like the idea of siblings also

2419,"[5/23/20, 5:23:32 AM] Joe: Hmm🤔 
"
2420,"[5/23/20, 5:24:48 AM] Joe: I don’t know exactly how I want to raise my children. But as long as they are loved and happy and they have what they need, I’ll be happy.
"
2421,"[5/23/20, 5:25:53 AM] Joe: What you described is definitely more of my style though. Camping and stuff instead of hotels and all that.
"
2422,"[5/23/20, 5:30:06 AM] Joe: I never imagined many details. I don’t know...I think it’s because I don’t want to completely control the lives of my children hahah so I don’t want to make up stories in my mind about what they should or shouldn’t be.

"
2426,"[5/23/20, 5:37:51 AM] Joe: No for sure. I know what you’re saying. What you described didn’t sound controlling or anything like that. Some people have the “detail” down to the smallest thing.
"
2427,"[5/23/20, 5:39:32 AM] Joe: Damn...I really didn’t mean to come off like that and I’m really sorry. What you describe sounds like it would give your children more freedom than the average and I really really like that

2429,"[5/23/20, 5:45:19 AM] Joe: Yeah I thought it sounded like a very “free” lifestyle. It’s one that I’m super into hahaha

"
2432,"[5/23/20, 5:58:34 AM] Joe: Also my dad was not a very affectionate guy haha. He would be the one to take me to do sports and all that but he was definitely one to fall in the background a bit. He worked hard though and I recognize that. 
"
2433,"[5/23/20, 6:15:30 AM] Joe: 😊
"
2434,"[5/23/20, 6:16:53 AM] Joe: I really appreciate that haha cause I really want to be a good dad. I had the weirdest moment working at summer camp last year when I was helping some kid and I thought to myself, “damn I should be a dad or something” haha
"
2435,"[5/23/20, 6:18:06 AM] Joe: I’m trying to teach my own kid how to skate...not everyone else’s hahaha
"
2436,"[5/23/20, 6:23:50 AM] Joe: That does sound nice and I was not expecting you to say that haha
"
2437,"[5/23/20, 6:25:12 AM] Joe: But thank you 😊 you seem like you’d be a great mom. I would definitely be stoked if you were my kids mom
"
2438,"[5/23/20, 6:28:03 AM] Joe: Ok now I think I can go to sleep hahaha. i enjoyed our talk. Some good information here 😂

"
2445,"[5/23/20, 1:33:53 PM] Joe: Yeah. There is just so much arguing and confusion in the US right now I was just wondering what kind of updates people are getting in other places
"
2446,"[5/23/20, 1:36:58 PM] Joe: Hmm ok that sounds reasonable I guess. Everyone here is so divided here it’s hard to come up with a consensus for what we should do. Feels really weird.
"
2447,"[5/23/20, 1:37:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah that runny nose 🤧 must be hellllllaaaa pollen out there
"
2448,"[5/23/20, 1:47:24 PM] Joe: Hahahah damn the whole world is a fucking mess 😂 this shit is so weird. Aaaah can’t wait for it to be over
"
2449,"[5/23/20, 1:52:26 PM] Joe: So many people. I’m not looking forward to going back to the Bay Area haha. Too many humans everywhere! Fuck

2451,"[5/23/20, 2:26:05 PM] Joe: I wish I could stay. I need to go back though. At least for a few months. Skate camp didn’t get cancelled and I need to film for my video part. 
"
2452,"[5/23/20, 2:27:25 PM] Joe: I’m getting nervous though cause I’m having a hard time finding a place to stay but I already have my ticket back. Shiiiiiit
"
2453,"[5/23/20, 2:37:09 PM] Joe: Yeah I was going to stay with my friend but he rented out his extra room a couple weeks back. Now I’m trying to find something
"
2454,"[5/23/20, 2:39:57 PM] Joe: I just need a room to rent. But I’m not trying to pay crazy high rent or there is no point cause all the money I make will just go to rent. I’m trying to save up over the summer.
"
2455,"[5/23/20, 2:41:36 PM] Joe: I was going to stay with a friend but they had to rent out their extra room cause they lost hours at work and needed money for rent now. They couldn’t wait until when I get back. 
"
2456,"[5/23/20, 2:47:34 PM] Joe: Hahahaha whaaaaat!? I should just go to Madrid instead. Renting a single bedroom in a house will most likely be $900-$1200 for me in the Bay Area. A house would be $2000-$4000 😂
"
2457,"[5/23/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Yes. The Bay Area is absolutely insane with housing prices. It’s completely fucked.
"
2458,"[5/23/20, 2:49:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
2459,"[5/23/20, 2:51:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you can find some really high paying jobs there. My job is kind of in the middle of the pay rate though so I definitely struggle a little when I’m in the Bay Area but that’s true for a lot of people living there. So many big tech companies brought in a bunch of high paid software engineers and they made housing crazy expensive

2460,"[5/23/20, 2:52:21 PM] Joe: That’s why I need a good deal on my housing to make it worth it haha.
"
2461,"[5/23/20, 2:53:22 PM] Joe: Damn I can’t believe the housing prices out there. I wonder what it would cost to actually buy a property?
"
2462,"[5/23/20, 2:54:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
2463,"[5/23/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Yeah I think that’s the trend all over the world. People needed to stay with roommates or family for way longer than in the past

"
2465,"[5/23/20, 2:59:01 PM] Joe: Lol I guess I should think about leaving the US maybe. If I can keep saving at this rate I should be able to buy something cool in another country haha. But I’ll probably never be able to afford the Bay Area unless there is a housing crisis like the one in 2007/2008
"
2466,"[5/23/20, 3:03:02 PM] Joe: Haha unless I end up with a rich wife it’s pretty reasonable thing to think. Go on Zillow or similar real estate website and look at prices near Oakland/San Francisco/Berkeley. Shits crazy
"
2467,"[5/23/20, 3:05:43 PM] Joe: Hmmm maybe I’ll need to start thinking about places like this haha. I need to figure this shit out. I know the Bay Area is not my final destination
"
2468,"[5/23/20, 3:06:22 PM] Joe: Oh I’m not counting on that hahaha. I’m just saying, I can’t afford shit as a single dude in the bay
"
2469,"[5/23/20, 3:07:12 PM] Joe: If you stay really close to town and near the beach it could be similar to the Bay Area but if you find a place a little further out from people you can get good deals still
"
2470,"[5/23/20, 3:10:53 PM] Joe: This place is like an apartment. 2 bedrooms and it has a little back patio area where we grow stuff. It’s about $1200/month but she has been living here for a while and kept her rate. If you move in today rent would be higher.
"
2471,"[5/23/20, 3:13:02 PM] Joe: Yeah she has a good deal here. She’s not leaving any time soon hahah
"
2472,"[5/23/20, 3:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn that’s a strange reason for housing to be filling up 😂 
"
2473,"[5/23/20, 3:23:03 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck
"

"
2475,"[5/23/20, 3:31:17 PM] Joe: Probably happening here too I would imagine. Aaaah everything is so weird right now. Never would’ve imagined all this one year ago
"
2476,"[5/23/20, 3:32:37 PM] Joe: My flight is on June 8. I have to do a 3 hour layover on another island before flying back into Oakland.
"
2477,"[5/23/20, 3:32:57 PM] Joe: California is 3 hours ahead of Hawaii
"
2478,"[5/23/20, 3:34:50 PM] Joe: I still can’t believe we’ve talked as much as we have with a 12 hour time difference haha it’s been fun though
"
2479,"[5/23/20, 3:36:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha I can almost guarantee you’ll be the one who stops talking to me first 😂
"
2480,"[5/23/20, 3:37:44 PM] Joe: 😂 yeah it did! You surprised me a few times with how late you stayed up talking to me. I felt bad haha
"
2481,"[5/23/20, 3:40:05 PM] Joe: I don’t know. You’ll probably just get tired of me talking about my nerd shit hahaha
"
2482,"[5/23/20, 3:44:55 PM] Joe: Haha ok I guess maybe you find some entertainment in my crap. I feel like I talk to much about me I don’t get to hear enough about you. Which is weird cause i don’t like telling people about me haha
"
2483,"[5/23/20, 3:45:35 PM] Joe: I guess I just need to ask more questions if there is anything I want to know though. You’ve been pretty open about everything I ask so far
"
2484,"[5/23/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Haha alright good. If you ever don’t want to hear about something I’m telling you feel free to use that phrase I taught you, “shut the fuck up Joe” 😂
"
2485,"[5/23/20, 3:54:44 PM] Joe: Hahahah duuuude 😂 😂

"
2487,"[5/23/20, 4:03:12 PM] Joe: Can’t wait for the first time you actually use it. It’ll quickly become one of your most used phrases when talking to me haha
"
2488,"[5/23/20, 4:08:43 PM] Joe: Haha I never come up with good phrases to teach. I’ll think about it and try to send some good ones but if there is a particular topic you need phrases for that could help me narrow it down
"
2489,"[5/23/20, 4:08:58 PM] Joe: Analysis paralysis when deciding what phrases to tell you hahaha
"
2490,"[5/23/20, 4:19:30 PM] Joe: Hahahah I’m struggling so much coming up with good stuff. I need a topic there is just too much to choose from
"
2491,"[5/23/20, 4:20:59 PM] Joe: Here is a song while you wait for me to come up with something good. Random phrases are hard to think of. 
"
2492,"[5/23/20, 4:26:10 PM] Joe: It came on the radio when I was leaving the beach yesterday. “I wish you were here with me, on a beach in Hawaii”
"
2493,"[5/23/20, 4:26:11 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
2494,"[5/23/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: Ok that made me think of a phrase. “That song slaps” or “that shit was slappin’”
"
2495,"[5/23/20, 4:27:49 PM] Joe: Oh and, “this shit smackin” is when food is hella good hahaha. I’ll just teach you Bay Area slang 😂
"

"
2497,"[5/23/20, 4:30:24 PM] Joe: Damn now I need to think of some other good bay slang. People say some funny shit out there
"
2498,"[5/23/20, 4:32:16 PM] Joe: Oh you should say, “this song hella slaps” that would be straight out of Oakland haha
"
2499,"[5/23/20, 4:35:58 PM] Joe: Yeah those are very specific slang that doesn’t mean anything in a translator Haha
"
2500,"[5/23/20, 4:36:48 PM] Joe: But they’re used often in the bay. But if you go somewhere else people might look at you crazy and not know what you’re talking about haha
"
2501,"‎[5/23/20, 4:39:13 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
"
2502,"[5/23/20, 4:39:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m realizing I could talk slang to you and you would have no idea what I’m talking about
"
2503,"[5/23/20, 4:40:38 PM] Joe: Sometimes people will put an “sh” sound on smackin’. Like “shamackin”
"
2504,"[5/23/20, 4:40:53 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was shmackin” hahaha
"
2505,"[5/23/20, 4:41:15 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was hella shmackin” hahah I’m going to send you audio of that
"
2506,"‎[5/23/20, 4:41:27 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
"
2507,"[5/23/20, 4:42:14 PM] Joe: Threw a “yo” at the end but it doesn’t mean anything hahaha. “Yo” is a weird slang word that’s hard to describe.
"
2508,"[5/23/20, 4:43:12 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry people only talk this way in specific neighborhoods. It’s not like the whole bay talks like that. It’s less and less common as locals move out of the bay
"
2509,"[5/23/20, 4:44:31 PM] Joe: The rich software engineers that move to the bay from across the country definitely don’t talk that way haha.
"
2510,"[5/23/20, 4:46:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha send me a bad audio clip I don’t mind. It doesn’t need to be perfect.
"
2511,"[5/23/20, 4:47:10 PM] Joe: Say it like “that shit was slappen”
"
2512,"[5/23/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: I bet if you say it like it has “en” at the end it’ll sound perfect
"
2513,"[5/23/20, 4:47:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha siiiiii
"
2514,"[5/23/20, 4:48:03 PM] Joe: Hella slappin yo
"
2515,"[5/23/20, 4:48:25 PM] Joe: That sentence makes zero sense outside of slang hahaha
"
2516,"[5/23/20, 4:49:38 PM] Joe: You’re going to speak English like you grew up in the hood
"
2517,"[5/23/20, 4:50:41 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
"
2518,"[5/23/20, 4:52:45 PM] Joe: Wow that got better really fast
"
2519,"[5/23/20, 4:53:12 PM] Joe: The difference from the first audio to the last is quite a big difference haha. Nice
"
2520,"[5/23/20, 4:53:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah ronronear boludo
"
2521,"[5/23/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha best way to relieve the frustration with a ronronear 😂
"
2522,"[5/23/20, 5:00:24 PM] Joe: Hahahaha with the voice though 😂
"
2523,"[5/23/20, 5:01:56 PM] Joe: Haha pretty good. You can leave off the “yo” and it’s the same shit. Or you could throw it at the beginning instead like “yooooo that was hella shmackin” 😂
"
2524,"[5/23/20, 5:02:35 PM] Joe: It’s so funny to try to explain slang that I’ve heard and never really questioned whether or not it made sense. Cause it doesn’t make sense hahah
"
2525,"[5/23/20, 5:03:35 PM] Joe: Maybe because when you eat really loud that sound can be called “smacking” sometimes. Who knows 🤷‍♂️
"
2526,"[5/23/20, 5:04:39 PM] Joe: Haha I want you to say this to me if I make you a good breakfast. Please hahaha
"
2527,"[5/23/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: Yeessss like that. Say that to me when I make you something good 😂
"
2528,"[5/23/20, 5:06:54 PM] Joe: Haha not the most useful phrase but I’ll enjoy hearing it
"
2529,"[5/23/20, 5:07:31 PM] Joe: Mostly used for good foods.
"
2530,"[5/23/20, 5:08:16 PM] Joe: It can be used for other stuff but it’s harder to contextualize. Like you could say a house party was smackin
"
2531,"[5/23/20, 5:10:09 PM] Joe: That’s the safest bet haha. Damn it’s going to be sooo long before you can say that to me in person haha fuck

2534,"[5/23/20, 5:28:58 PM] Joe: Of course. I was planning on doing it in California but maybe I should just see if I can do it online out here haha
"
2535,"[5/23/20, 5:30:34 PM] Joe: Honestly i would love to do it I’m not even joking

"
2537,"[5/23/20, 5:33:27 PM] Joe: You know but seriously, it would probably take 2 months to get a passport and id need to get a ticket so it could be 3, maybe 4 total. I think if we’re still talking at that time we should really talk about what the plan should be. Unless you just want to talk to me from far away forever haha I hope that’s not the case
"
2538,"[5/23/20, 5:34:38 PM] Joe: I mean, we should plan sooner rather than later but I’m just saying....I’m willing to take a chance and go anywhere, do anything, and just spend some time with you
"
2539,"[5/23/20, 5:35:05 PM] Joe: Cause it sounds like fun and it would make for a good story no matter what happens in the end haha
"
2540,"[5/23/20, 5:39:47 PM] Joe: Haha fooled me for a second.
"
2541,"[5/23/20, 5:40:04 PM] Joe: I understand the nervous joke. I’m all about the nervous joke hahah that’s my shit
"
2542,"[5/23/20, 5:41:54 PM] Joe: Hey I’m getting better fast ok. I still have 3-4 months to improve haha
"
2543,"[5/23/20, 5:45:37 PM] Joe: Haha ok I understand. I don’t really know what to say so I’m just going to say nothing at all 😂
"
2544,"[5/23/20, 5:49:26 PM] Joe: Haha ok we’ll see how you feel in another month.
"
2545,"[5/23/20, 5:49:52 PM] Joe: Haha which one?
"
2546,"[5/23/20, 5:53:47 PM] Joe: Hahahah alright shiiiit

2547,"[5/23/20, 5:53:55 PM] Joe: Oh god

"
2551,"[5/23/20, 6:05:40 PM] Joe: Sorry I don’t know why it took so long to send. But you’ll have something to watch in the morning. I totally ruined the video haha.
"
2552,"[5/23/20, 6:08:13 PM] Joe: Haha it’s a movie
"
2553,"[5/23/20, 6:08:26 PM] Joe: 😂

"
2569,"[5/23/20, 6:25:43 PM] Joe: 🤔 I’m not really sure what is making it go so slow to the point if crashing if it’s not the memory.

2624,"[5/24/20, 11:58:50 AM] Joe: Yeah EDX is a big website. I’ve taken other courses on it for programming. You can take courses from places like Harvard for free on that site
"
2625,"[5/24/20, 12:00:08 PM] Joe: But I’ll still check out busuu. The more content the better. Let’s me see the same thing explained in different ways
"
2626,"[5/24/20, 12:02:13 PM] Joe: Edx.org/schools-partners
"
2627,"[5/24/20, 12:02:38 PM] Joe: You can take a lot of the courses for free on EDX but you don’t get a certificate
"
2628,"[5/24/20, 12:06:37 PM] Joe: Truuueee. I’ve never paid for any of the courses from EDX. I just need the knowledge not the paper haha
"
2629,"[5/24/20, 12:08:27 PM] Joe: Sweet. I’ll check this out. I would like to have my own courses online eventually. I don’t even know what I’d teach haha but it’d be cool to share something I know and make a few bucks doing it.
"
2630,"[5/24/20, 12:20:56 PM] Joe: Hahah I had to practice to get comfortable with a camera. I actually really don’t like it 😂 
"
2631,"[5/24/20, 12:26:12 PM] Joe: Damn...I really appreciate that. You’re the best
"
2632,"[5/24/20, 12:27:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’d be hella good. Making YouTube videos is pretty fun. I was started to make a few bucks off of them from my skateboard channel before they changed the rules hahah. I should get back on that and get that passive income flowing
"
2633,"[5/24/20, 12:28:54 PM] Joe: The only thing is you have to make a video almost everyday or your channel doesn’t get much traction. It’s really not that hard to get it going though if you can come up with some decent content and you’re active in an online community like a forum or something related to the topic of your channel
"
2634,"[5/24/20, 12:36:53 PM] Joe: Going viral isn’t too important. It’s more about getting a solid base of subscribers that watch all your stuff. An occasional viral video will help grow the channel faster but not really necessary.
"
2635,"[5/24/20, 12:36:59 PM] Joe: Yeaaah I really should’ve started making videos when I came out here but I don’t have a camera anymore cause mine broke haha.
"
2636,"[5/24/20, 12:37:23 PM] Joe: Hahahah thanks for subscribing 😂
"
2637,"[5/24/20, 12:37:34 PM] Joe: Don’t forget to smash that like button hahaha
"
2638,"[5/24/20, 12:39:16 PM] Joe: Yeah you make more from a viral video but the real key is building a consistent library of videos. Viral videos only help so much because a lot of the people that find them aren’t really that interested in the content of the channel but just that specific video.
"
2639,"[5/24/20, 12:40:29 PM] Joe: I can’t do it haha I really notice the quality. Especially if things like the audio so I need a microphone like I was using before. But iPhone video quality should work fine.
"
2640,"[5/24/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck
"
2641,"[5/24/20, 12:41:26 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised how many people comment on a video with bad quality saying it needs to improve
"
2642,"[5/24/20, 12:42:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ll probably never post to the RC channel again 😂 but thanks for subscribing haha
"
2643,"[5/24/20, 12:44:25 PM] Joe: You get paid per view. What category the content is determines how much you get per view. Pretty sure technology videos and makeup videos get the highest pay per view on YouTube.
"
2644,"[5/24/20, 12:45:40 PM] Joe: Hahahaha good, I’m glad you hate them. But just know, they make a lot of money from those 😂
"
2645,"[5/24/20, 12:46:22 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that sounds annoying
"
2646,"[5/24/20, 12:46:46 PM] Joe: I’m going to make you a YouTube channel one of these days 😂 you’ll have to learn to be in front of the camera haha
"
2647,"[5/24/20, 12:51:42 PM] Joe: Haha its pretty hard to come off natural when making a YouTube video 😂 
"
2648,"[5/24/20, 12:53:25 PM] Joe: Hahahah we’ll make the “two people that don’t understand each other travel the world together” channel. 
"
2649,"[5/24/20, 12:58:30 PM] Joe: That’s because I film them when I’m by myself mostly. That’s when I’m in my natural element. When no one is around hahaha
"
2650,"[5/24/20, 1:00:53 PM] Joe: I’m telling my friends you said I’m the king of YouTube hahahah. I’ve tried to convince them for years that we should be making short YouTube videos. 1 or 2 a week would’ve been enough to build a decent channel. And if everyone actually did their part it’d be easy. 
"
2651,"[5/24/20, 1:01:27 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
"
2652,"[5/24/20, 1:02:15 PM] Joe: Dude....we’re going to have to make that video. If we get the plans to see each other settled I’ll start documenting more to make something. Even if it’s just for us to look back on and enjoy
"
2653,"[5/24/20, 1:04:40 PM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if I ask you to record a video with your thoughts about something haha
"
2654,"‎[5/24/20, 1:06:30 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
2655,"[5/24/20, 1:09:17 PM] Joe: There is so much different stuff going on between the states. Some states are super strictly locked down while others are not taking it as seriously. This is in the state of Missouri yesterday
"
2656,"[5/24/20, 1:24:54 PM] Joe: Damn that was a pretty good video. Little dude is hella cool. Thanks for sending that. Really interesting
"
2657,"[5/24/20, 1:27:52 PM] Joe: Half of my country thinks the disease is a hoax or that it is being blown out of proportion by the media
"
2658,"[5/24/20, 1:28:49 PM] Joe: I understand some of the doubt. At the beginning our government and media were telling us things like, “there is no proof it can be transmitted between people” and “wearing a mask doesn’t help” before reversing and saying the opposite and mandating that everyone wear a mask
"
2659,"[5/24/20, 1:29:19 PM] Joe: Plus America has always been full of people with a, “don’t tell me what to do” attitude. Our country was founded on that attitude haha
"
2660,"[5/24/20, 1:30:16 PM] Joe: But that doesn’t mean they aren’t a bunch of dummies. Cause they are and they’re making things worse. But I understand, somewhat, their mindset, even though I don’t agree with it
"
2661,"[5/24/20, 1:39:08 PM] Joe: Yeah suicides are waaaaay up here in the US right now and businesses are closing fast
"
2662,"[5/24/20, 1:41:37 PM] Joe: I don’t know it just seems messed up. Like a lot of big chain stores remained open while the mom and pop stores were forced to close. The virus is real and terrible but the economic impact is going to last a loooong time. 
"
2663,"[5/24/20, 1:43:27 PM] Joe: True. But I don’t expect 100% of people or even close to 100% of people to comply
"
2664,"[5/24/20, 1:53:36 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t understand how this plan works? They want people to travel but they don’t have money to travel hahaha
"
2665,"[5/24/20, 1:54:04 PM] Joe: Oook enjoy dinner. I’ll talk to you later 😚
"
2666,"[5/24/20, 1:54:46 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️
"
2667,"[5/24/20, 1:56:05 PM] Joe: Curls? Like my hair? Haha wait never mind don’t answer. Go enjoy dinner you can get back to me later haha

"
2672,"[5/24/20, 3:05:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn
"
2673,"[5/24/20, 3:08:47 PM] Joe: Haha whaaaat? I must have a really bad score. I thought it was going well 🤔 hahaha

2675,"[5/24/20, 3:09:55 PM] Joe: I knew you’d stop talking to me first hahaha I’m one bad gif away from being cutoff 😂
"
2676,"[5/24/20, 3:11:55 PM] Joe: Hahahaha nice
"
2677,"[5/24/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha what if I was bad at sending gifs from the start? Would that have been a deal breaker?
"
2678,"[5/24/20, 3:16:15 PM] Joe: Hahah damn good thing I didn’t pick a bunch of stupid gifs at first 😂 
"
2679,"[5/24/20, 3:16:56 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I totally get it. I feel the same way. If the humor doesn’t connect it’s hard to just be relaxed and have fun talking
"
2680,"[5/24/20, 3:20:40 PM] Joe: So far so good haha

"
2683,"[5/24/20, 3:32:13 PM] Joe: When we make our super famous YouTube channel we’ll have to go see some kangaroos somewhere 😂 😂
"
2684,"[5/24/20, 3:53:11 PM] Joe: Hahaha that would definitely be a viral video 😂
"
2685,"[5/24/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Have you ever seen a kangaroo up close? I’ve never seen one. Doesn’t look like a good idea to get too close to them haha
"
2686,"[5/24/20, 4:15:51 PM] Joe: Haha alright. Well you should get some good rest then. Tomorrow will be fun for you. Don’t forget about me now that you’re free 😂

"
2691,"[5/25/20, 3:09:50 AM] Joe: I’m probably going to fall back asleep but send more photos and videos 😊 
"
2692,"[5/25/20, 8:15:14 AM] Joe: Holaaa! How’d the journey go? Did you make it? Where’s the photooos?

"

"
2696,"[5/25/20, 10:11:38 AM] Joe: It looks super nice out there. Way different than Madrid haha
"
2697,"[5/25/20, 1:20:55 PM] Joe: All good. Hope you had fun! I literally just got back from skating haha so good timing
"
2698,"[5/25/20, 1:41:19 PM] Joe: Damn hella gorgeous

2703,"[5/25/20, 1:51:08 PM] Joe: Haha fuck I wish! I was thinking about how it sucks that this covid shit is keeping me from being able to go see you, then I realize I wouldn’t even know you if it wasn’t for covid hahah
"
2704,"[5/25/20, 1:56:46 PM] Joe: Saaaame. You’ve definitely made quarantine more fun for me haha
"
2705,"[5/25/20, 1:57:29 PM] Joe: Naaaaaaah. Spill the beans haha
"
2706,"[5/25/20, 1:57:43 PM] Joe: Is it working better yet?
"
2707,"[5/25/20, 2:01:07 PM] Joe: Haha oh yeah. Spill the beans is like to say, “tell me everything”
"
2708,"[5/25/20, 2:03:21 PM] Joe: Ooooh boy hahaha. What’d they say? That always makes me nervous haha. Getting the approval of the friends 😂

"
2710,"[5/25/20, 2:09:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha wow ok cool. I was nervous. Didn’t expect such a reaction. I’m glad you have an excited face when talking about me haha.

"
2716,"[5/25/20, 2:20:04 PM] Joe: Yeah my friends were happy for me but not so happy when I said that going to Spain might be an option for me now haha. They don’t want me to leave them.
"
2717,"[5/25/20, 2:24:15 PM] Joe: I’m so interested to know what you told your friends about me. 
"
2718,"[5/25/20, 2:28:17 PM] Joe: Hahah niiiice. Yeah I’m definitely trying to come out there. I tried to start my passport shit the other day but I need to do it in person with certain paperwork that I don’t have with me here.
"
2719,"[5/25/20, 2:29:22 PM] Joe: I’d probably tell a few of my really close friends more details if I was having a one on one type of conversation but it gets weird telling all of my friends at once in a group chat 😂
"
2720,"[5/25/20, 2:31:33 PM] Joe: Hahaha the more you tell me the more I like it

"
2723,"[5/25/20, 2:41:07 PM] Joe: Hahaha the ultimate pocket. At first I was like 😳 hahahaha

"
2727,"[5/25/20, 3:33:57 PM] Joe: Mmmm like 3 weeks. I shared some with the family hahah but yeah it went fast

"
2742,"[5/25/20, 4:04:49 PM] Joe: Ok ok hold on I’m going to try the phrase about the words one more time.

2751,"[5/25/20, 4:15:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha at least I can feel the improvement. Definitely better than this time last month!
"
2752,"[5/25/20, 4:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahahaha gracias 😊
"
2753,"[5/25/20, 4:17:29 PM] Joe: I’m working on saying things with a little more confidence. When I started trying to say things, everything sounded like a question because of the unsure tone of my voice haha
"
2754,"[5/25/20, 4:23:52 PM] Joe: For sure. I would have been too nervous or would’ve stumbled too much to make it through confidently.
"
2755,"[5/25/20, 4:24:19 PM] Joe: It’s cool, the little improvements keep me motivated to learn more.
"
2756,"[5/25/20, 4:28:07 PM] Joe: Hahaha mmm I wish I could be there with you. 
"
2757,"[5/26/20, 12:41:12 AM] Joe: I wrote some code to find the words you’ve used the most since I started talking to you. I’m going to use it to help me study relevant words. I hope you don’t think this is weird, I figured it’d help me study 😂

"
2760,"[5/26/20, 1:09:17 AM] Joe: Hahaha thanks. I was worried you would just think it’s weird 😂 I figured if I’m going to learn a lot of words, they might as well be the ones you use all the time
"
2761,"[5/26/20, 1:13:21 AM] Joe: Hahah I’m glad you like it. Yeah there are some funny ones in the list 😂 I haven’t gone through it all the way yet. I pretty much just finished the code when I sent it to you.
"
2762,"[5/26/20, 1:19:29 AM] Joe: Hahah I downloaded the chat and then I wrote some code to organize it and count the number of times words show up

"
2770,"[5/26/20, 1:25:16 AM] Joe: Oh shit ok I didn’t know that. I only have it on my phone so it was easier this way for me anyway. It just gets emailed to you when you export it from the app
"
2771,"[5/26/20, 1:25:58 AM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
2772,"[5/26/20, 1:31:33 AM] Joe: Hahaha you’re having fun sending me audio.
"
2773,"[5/26/20, 1:33:10 AM] Joe: I’ve heard of those Xiaomi phone. They look cool. All my friends have iPhones though so sharing things is easier, especially video, when we all have iPhones.
"
2774,"[5/26/20, 1:34:41 AM] Joe: Haha iPhones are the best for making skateboard edits with 😂
"
2775,"[5/26/20, 1:38:05 AM] Joe: Maybe I’ll try one eventually. I need to make this phone last though haha

"
2794,"[5/26/20, 2:17:19 AM] Joe: Dammit how do I get my r on point so no one can tell? Haha I’m not trying to be super obvious. Alright I need to practice R words
"
2795,"[5/26/20, 2:17:48 AM] Joe: I’ll just practice ronronear until I got the r sound down 😂

2798,"[5/26/20, 2:21:10 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess as long as people can understand me that’s what matters most. But I would definitely feel more confident when I speak if I knew it sounded “right”
"
2799,"[5/26/20, 2:23:47 AM] Joe: Haha i just like getting it right 😂 I’m not satisfied when I can tell it’s off.
"
2800,"[5/26/20, 2:24:17 AM] Joe: But you’re right. Everyone has a different accent. Trying to at least get close though haha
"
2801,"[5/26/20, 2:25:14 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess I see what you’re saying cause I like the way you sound haha
"
2802,"[5/26/20, 2:28:35 AM] Joe: That’s true haha alright I won’t put too much thought into the accent. If you hear something that’s waaaay off I need you to say something though haha
"
2803,"[5/26/20, 2:45:13 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m not sure why that accent comes more naturally. As long as it sounds good to you that’s all that matters 🤷‍♂️
"

"
2820,"[5/26/20, 11:44:31 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ll download Spotify. No big deal
"
2821,"[5/26/20, 11:45:02 AM] Joe: It’ll be faster than looking for the songs and that way you can keep adding to the playlist and I’ll see the songs
"
2822,"[5/26/20, 11:45:47 AM] Joe: Joe Rogan just signed with Spotify and I always listen to his podcast so I’m going to download it eventually anyways haha
"
2823,"[5/26/20, 11:49:16 AM] Joe: Haha it’s all good! If it makes it easier to send stuff to each other, I’m happy to download
"
2824,"[5/26/20, 11:52:14 AM] Joe: Hell yeah. Got it. Now you can just add songs to that playlist and I’ll hear them when they come up. Thank you thank you!
"
2825,"[5/26/20, 11:53:02 AM] Joe: I like a pretty wide range of music haha. As long as it fits the mood for the day I enjoy it
"
2826,"[5/26/20, 11:53:55 AM] Joe: I’ve really been liking the music you’ve sent so far too. Just send whatever you like. Anything you like to listen to. Don’t worry if I’ll like it or not, it’s more important that you like it.
"
2827,"[5/26/20, 11:55:16 AM] Joe: Los delincuentes also like singing about crumbs and mustaches hahaha I like their stuff for sure
"
2828,"[5/26/20, 12:01:44 PM] Joe: Haha do you want to see the list? I can send it to you

2830,"[5/26/20, 12:06:51 PM] Joe: Hmm I’m not sure I understand this correctly. The music you like is played in the nightclubs? Or no?
"
2831,"[5/26/20, 12:07:49 PM] Joe: Ok for sure that makes more sense haha. That’s why I was kind of confused
"
2832,"[5/26/20, 12:08:44 PM] Joe: Damn maybe I should make the same kind of list with the words I use. I wonder what words I use a lot 🤔
"
2833,"[5/26/20, 12:10:01 PM] Joe: Yeah I’ve heard of that style of music but I don’t hear it played often
"
2834,"[5/26/20, 12:13:27 PM] Joe: Haha I think I get it. Hippie isn’t the most positive term around here haha. But I know what you mean when you say it
"
2835,"[5/26/20, 12:15:13 PM] Joe: Languages are so weird. I’ve been thinking lately about how imprecise they are sometimes. Words are like an abstraction of feelings so sometimes it’s hard to describe a word, especially with a language barrier 😂
"
2836,"[5/26/20, 12:15:59 PM] Joe: Haha alright. Should be pretty easy. I’ll send it to you later
"
2837,"[5/26/20, 12:17:30 PM] Joe: Hahaha I know the feeling.

2839,"[5/26/20, 12:21:10 PM] Joe: Hahah so far I get it. But I still think you’ll have to show me these people. Although, I feel like I’d recognize them if I saw them. They sound like my kind of people hahah
"
2840,"[5/26/20, 12:27:12 PM] Joe: Mmm I liiiike it hahah
"
2841,"[5/26/20, 12:28:40 PM] Joe: You did a great job explaining hahah. Not sure if I fit in with their music selection or the earrings but the rest describes me well 😆
"
2842,"[5/26/20, 12:29:49 PM] Joe: I like their music, but I’m not sure they’d like the random shit I listen to sometimes haha. I’m like a jukebox with every genre in it and it’s set to play random music
"
2843,"[5/26/20, 12:31:38 PM] Joe: You can feel my campechano vibes from afar 😂
"
2844,"[5/26/20, 12:32:13 PM] Joe: Hahahaha neither of those thankfully 😂 😂
"
2845,"[5/26/20, 12:37:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I mean I can do that. It would just be all over the place. Some stuff you’ll like, like the things I sent you already, and some stuff you’ll hate 🤷‍♂️ 
"
2846,"[5/26/20, 12:38:12 PM] Joe: It’s about the feeling or memory the song gives me more than the actual song itself sometimes
"
2847,"[5/26/20, 12:45:30 PM] Joe: Haha now just imagine if instead of getting songs from people in Uruguay, you got songs from the people in the Bay Area that say, “this shit slaps” 😂 😂

"
2852,"[5/26/20, 1:09:06 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll make some Spotify playlist. There will be stuff you like and stuff you hate I’m sure. Most of the songs on my current playlist are island style and the stuff you sent me but I’m going to send you stuff I used to listen to also.
"
2853,"[5/26/20, 1:09:58 PM] Joe: 😂 nooooo you won’t. I guarantee you won’t like everything.
"
2854,"[5/26/20, 1:10:11 PM] Joe: I’m putting it together on Spotify for you now

"
2877,"[5/26/20, 1:45:28 PM] Joe: It’s hard to contextualize haha I understand your reservations on that song. Not the greatest haha but i like the artist sometimes.
"
2878,"[5/26/20, 1:47:34 PM] Joe: He has an interesting story growing up in Compton California and a lot of his songs tell a story about growing up there. I should’ve picked a better example of his music haha but it was one of the first ones to pop up
"
2879,"[5/26/20, 1:51:20 PM] Joe: Hahah what is happening? I’m not adding anything haha

"
2893,"[5/26/20, 2:42:01 PM] Joe: I only gave the top 1000. I think you had about 3200 words total though. I didn’t check my total
"
2894,"[5/26/20, 2:45:35 PM] Joe: Haha I told you 80% of spoken Spanish is 1000 words so 3200 is not unreasonable in my opinion.
"
2895,"[5/26/20, 2:47:22 PM] Joe: Haha just trying to be efficient here. I’ll check my total now. One second
"
2896,"[5/26/20, 2:49:16 PM] Joe: Oh and yeah having the same word spelled differently or a different conjugation of the same word will be two different words on the list
"
2897,"[5/26/20, 2:49:29 PM] Joe: I’ve only used 2335 words according to this haha
"
2898,"[5/26/20, 2:50:31 PM] Joe: Interesting data. Maybe I’ll update it again in a month or so. We can see how the words move around over time
"
2899,"[5/26/20, 2:52:18 PM] Joe: Hahah I should make a website for us that shows some visualizations for word use over time 🤔 
"

"
2906,"[5/26/20, 3:09:14 PM] Joe: Hahaha I want to shower you in complements but sometimes I’m worried you’ll think it’s corny.
"
2907,"[5/26/20, 3:10:42 PM] Joe: And words of affection too. I guess that feeling is a part of being shy. I’ll do better haha just don’t judge me too much if I say something corny
"
2908,"[5/26/20, 3:16:18 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that makes sense. I’ll do that
"
2909,"[5/26/20, 3:21:39 PM] Joe: I think it’s sweet when you say corny things haha. Especially cause I know you aren’t super into that kind of stuff, I appreciate that you can be that way with me occasionally. And you never overdue it so it always seems genuinely nice

"
2912,"[5/26/20, 3:38:00 PM] Joe: Well this time is Costco but sometimes it’s a different store haha.
"
2913,"[5/26/20, 3:38:55 PM] Joe: Haha yeah and pinocho. I love all that stuff 😂

"
2916,"[5/26/20, 3:47:31 PM] Joe: Words of affection in English sound way more corny to me than Spanish words haha. The only one I use is babe or baby 😂
"
2917,"[5/26/20, 3:49:01 PM] Joe: Sweetie, beautiful, cutie seem like not the words I want to use. It’s like I want to use their meaning but the exact word just doesn’t feel right haha
"
2918,"[5/26/20, 3:55:07 PM] Joe: Ok I’m about to go in this Costco. I’ll probably be in there for a while. No service in there so I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
"
2919,"[5/26/20, 4:06:30 PM] Joe: I’m stuck in line to go in haha

"
2950,"[5/27/20, 3:28:21 PM] Joe: The good news is, the longer it takes, the more time I have to practice my spanish but it’s really not a pleasant feeling not being able to see you sometimes.

2951,"[5/27/20, 3:29:27 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve literally wanted to ask you the same for the last few days 😂 
"
2952,"[5/27/20, 3:29:59 PM] Joe: Hahah dammit missed my chance
"
2953,"[5/27/20, 3:31:54 PM] Joe: Yes seriously. But then I just think to myself, “that doesn’t make sense to say, you’ve never met her”..but the feeling is there

"
2957,"[5/27/20, 3:37:10 PM] Joe: Shit
"
2958,"[5/27/20, 3:38:54 PM] Joe: Why do you have to actually be a cool person and so far away at the same time? This would’ve been a lot easier if you were just boring and uninteresting 😂

"
2965,"[5/27/20, 4:08:30 PM] Joe: Hahaha alright
"
2966,"[5/27/20, 4:13:43 PM] Joe: Could’ve been anybody, and for some reason you messaged me, very randomly, so I blame you for everything haha. I don’t know though. I just find you interesting and ummm we have like, the same outlook on stuff a lot of the time, which is really nice. Mmm there’s so much stuff. I don’t know. There are like 6 billion humans and...I don’t know...you found me on the internet haha. Anyway, I wish I was with you. I miss you. Ok. Byyye
"
2967,"[5/27/20, 4:18:21 PM] Joe: Oh I also forgot to tell you. It’s pretty weird cause when I first came here to Hawaii I said I was going to focus on myself, do my own thing...girls were not supposed to be a part of it. But I don’t know how you pulled me in. You pulled me out of my shell and made me start talking and I couldn’t stop. I still can’t stop. Blah blah blah blah. Anyway, i don’t know what else to say, I’ve got lots of things to say, maybe I’ll write you a letter or something. Ok feel free to send me a video too!
"
2968,"[5/27/20, 5:04:54 PM] Joe: No problem sweetie
"
2969,"[5/27/20, 5:05:07 PM] Joe: I’ll start working on that letter soon haha

"
2974,"[5/28/20, 5:45:54 AM] Joe: Aw I’m glad you liked them. I was having a lot of fun listening to the audio clips you sent hahaha
"
2975,"[5/28/20, 5:46:22 AM] Joe: Tres triste tigres 😂
"
2976,"[5/28/20, 5:48:38 AM] Joe: Hahahaha sounded like you were having a good time. Made me want to be there with you.
"
2977,"[5/28/20, 5:49:24 AM] Joe: I wish I could download just the audio clips haha. So good

2983,"[5/28/20, 5:57:41 AM] Joe: That shits hard
"
2984,"[5/28/20, 5:59:34 AM] Joe: Haha it wasn’t so hard since I was reading it while I was saying it.
"
2985,"[5/28/20, 5:59:46 AM] Joe: And I went a little slow
"
2986,"[5/28/20, 6:00:37 AM] Joe: I also messed up in there somewhere haha. If I said it fast and loud without reading it I would probably do horribly 😂 
"
2987,"[5/28/20, 6:01:00 AM] Joe: You’ll have to do “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” hahah
"
2988,"[5/28/20, 6:02:33 AM] Joe: Hahaha niiiiice! I found the whole thing. I’m going to try it haha

"
2998,"[5/28/20, 10:54:20 AM] Joe: Duuuude they changed my flight and now it’s going to take 13 hours to get from Hawaii to San Francisco. It usually only takes 5 hours 🤦‍♂️

"
3002,"[5/28/20, 11:11:56 AM] Joe: George Floyd
"
3003,"[5/28/20, 11:12:51 AM] Joe: Yeah some insane stuff happening right now. Los Angeles had some protest on the freeway yesterday too.
"
3004,"[5/28/20, 11:17:54 AM] Joe: Yeah the video went viral and it shows the officer with his knee on the mans neck for 9+ minutes. The man at the beginning was saying he can’t breathe and by the end was dead. 
"
3005,"[5/28/20, 11:25:41 AM] Joe: Yeah that shit was fucked up
"
3006,"[5/28/20, 11:26:24 AM] Joe: The same shit has been happening for years and nothing ever changes. People are tired of it
"
3007,"[5/28/20, 11:35:12 AM] Joe: It’s super messed up. And it really feels like nothing will change. That’s probably how the people that are setting things on fire and destroying stuff feel. Like it’ll never change
"
3008,"[5/28/20, 11:40:39 AM] Joe: No. There is nothing happening here for protest or anything. I guess a part of the problem is the country being so big.
"
3009,"[5/28/20, 11:41:16 AM] Joe: There are some protest in California. In Los Angeles but not as big as it should be or as big as it would take to change things
"

"
3013,"[5/28/20, 11:44:44 AM] Joe: It’s my only way back
"
3014,"[5/28/20, 11:47:08 AM] Joe: Not many flights going out of Hawaii right now so I can’t really do much about it. In normal times I’d agree with what you’re saying. But for now I just have to suck it up and make the journey.
"
3015,"[5/28/20, 11:47:32 AM] Joe: I’ll be ok. It’ll just be one uncomfortable day
"
3016,"[5/28/20, 11:48:21 AM] Joe: I mean, I checked for other flights and there aren’t any going out. This was the one. Unless I want to wait until July
"
3017,"[5/28/20, 11:49:04 AM] Joe: I’m not really too upset about it hahah. It’s going to be annoying but it’s ok.
"
3018,"[5/28/20, 11:49:37 AM] Joe: Just have to make sure I have lots of movies and shows downloaded and have my computer charged. I’ll keep busy.
"
3019,"[5/28/20, 11:50:31 AM] Joe: I’m easy going 🤷‍♂️ It’s hard to make me really upset about something hahah. It’s not the end of the world
"
3020,"[5/28/20, 11:52:41 AM] Joe: It’d be funny if we were going on a trip together and something like this happened with the tickets. You’d probably be calling and trying to fix it...and I’ll just be saying, “honey it’s fiiiiine, no big deal”
"
3021,"[5/28/20, 11:56:22 AM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
3022,"[5/28/20, 11:56:27 AM] Joe: 😂
"
3023,"[5/28/20, 11:57:20 AM] Joe: Good news is my sister bought a ticket for the same flight. She is going to surprise my parents when they come to pick me up haha. Should be good
"
3024,"[5/28/20, 11:57:50 AM] Joe: 😂
"
3025,"[5/28/20, 11:58:27 AM] Joe: I mean it’s not sooo bad. Just watch movies and tv and code like I’m stuck in quarantine.
"
3026,"[5/28/20, 11:59:10 AM] Joe: It’ll be fun to see their reaction haha. She’s just coming for a week since she doesn’t have work right now.
"
3027,"[5/28/20, 12:01:20 PM] Joe: Flight is at 10:20a so I’ll probably send a few messages before haha
"
3028,"[5/28/20, 12:18:07 PM] Joe: It’ll be the best part of the day for me by far hahaha
"
3029,"[5/28/20, 12:20:20 PM] Joe: You taking a break from the course because of the computer running slow, right? Cause I’m trying to see more of your fancy 3d stuff!
"
3030,"[5/28/20, 12:41:28 PM] Joe: Haha it’s alright you should still send it to me. I want to see it! It will be like when I showed you my dice game when it was ugly 😂 you can always change it after being graded on it to match your style too
"
3031,"[5/28/20, 12:42:47 PM] Joe: I’d like to see it and maybe if you change it later I will have an idea of the before and after haha
"
3032,"[5/28/20, 3:48:10 PM] Joe: Haha those allergy pill knock you out 😂 No worries, sleep well babe. Buenas noches 😘
"
3033,"[5/28/20, 11:37:11 PM] Joe: Why didn’t you sleep well? Too much noise again?
"
3034,"[5/28/20, 11:38:01 PM] Joe: ♥️

"
3038,"[5/28/20, 11:43:23 PM] Joe: My spanish? Terrible haha
"
3039,"[5/28/20, 11:45:10 PM] Joe: Eh I still can’t talk to you on the phone and that really sucks. So not good enough

3041,"[5/28/20, 11:54:48 PM] Joe: I was thinking lately about how awkward it’s going to be to try and talk on the phone for the first time.  I hope you’re ready for that  haha 
"
3042,"[5/28/20, 11:57:41 PM] Joe: I just want you to be prepared for it to be difficult and a little weird at first. It might even feel discouraging the first time. 
"
3043,"[5/29/20, 12:05:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha that would be great actually 😂
"
3044,"[5/29/20, 12:05:57 AM] Joe: Yeah I agree. It’s getting a little out of hand, hopefully more people aren’t hurt. The people that live there will live with the destruction for a long time
"
3045,"[5/29/20, 12:08:16 AM] Joe: I honestly wouldn’t mind not being able to communicate in person compared to on the phone. I think I can figure out how to get the idea across for most things in person but on the phone it’s all verbal.
"
3046,"[5/29/20, 12:17:44 AM] Joe: sólo quiero ser un mimo con usted jaja sería tan divertido
"

"
3049,"[5/29/20, 12:22:10 AM] Joe: jaha voy a tratar de traducir lo que digo antes de enviarlo más a menudo para que pueda obtener algunas cosas raras. Voy a tratar de corregirlo antes de enviarlo. buenas prácticas
"
3050,"[5/29/20, 12:22:28 AM] Joe: Con vos haha like you would say
"
3051,"[5/29/20, 12:26:38 AM] Joe: Hahah people will be so confused about how you learned that out of all the English phrases to learn 😂
"
3052,"[5/29/20, 12:30:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha you have to use “smackin” for the tortitas 🥞 “Slaps” and “slappin” for the music 🎶
"
3053,"[5/29/20, 12:34:33 AM] Joe: Hahah you definitely have some interesting ones 😂
"
3054,"[5/29/20, 11:51:26 AM] Joe: Buenos diaaaas. I’m out skating as you saw haha. It’s soo hot I’m dying out here. Got a long skate home now
"
3055,"[5/29/20, 11:52:08 AM] Joe: Well buenos días for me hahah i meant holaaaa

3059,"[5/29/20, 12:44:44 PM] Joe: Haha accessing password protected systems is all about tricking the person, not the computer.
"
3060,"[5/29/20, 12:45:56 PM] Joe: That’s why people send “fishing emails”. A fake email that looks real and ask for your info. Then instead of sending it to the bank or internet service provider or whatever, the info goes to the hacker dude haha
"
3061,"[5/29/20, 12:49:01 PM] Joe: If the password is halfway decent no program can guess it in a reasonable time.
"
3062,"[5/29/20, 12:49:51 PM] Joe: Also some things only let you guess a few times before sending an email or requesting you reset the password. 
"
3063,"[5/29/20, 3:02:32 PM] Joe: estaba bien. Realmente necesito una nueva tabla y zapatos, pero todavía era divertido
"
3064,"[5/29/20, 3:03:18 PM] Joe: I haven’t skated as much as I should’ve while I’ve been out here too. So I’m not feeling as good on the board as I usually do

"
3070,"[5/30/20, 12:53:52 PM] Joe: I wonder how long this will last. Oakland had some stuff happening last night that looked so crazy.
"
3071,"[5/30/20, 12:54:40 PM] Joe: Oh some good news I guess....rocket launched today haha https://youtu.be/pMsvr55cTZ0
"
3072,"[5/30/20, 12:55:55 PM] Joe: They were just breaking into buildings, starting fires, stealing stuff. Even saw a video of someone stealing a new car from an indoor dealership. They drove it right out the door 🤯
"
3073,"[5/30/20, 1:01:53 PM] Joe: So much shit. The protest remind me of occupy wallstreet protest but with a lot more anger.

"
3081,"[5/30/20, 1:24:21 PM] Joe: My friend was at the protest in Oakland last night and is telling me downtown is completely destroyed.
"
3082,"[5/30/20, 1:34:55 PM] Joe: I’m going back to so much chaos haha. Much different than being secluded on the island. Island life was nice while it lasted I guess. 
"
3083,"[5/30/20, 1:35:12 PM] Joe: How are you feeling today?
"
3084,"[5/30/20, 1:48:47 PM] Joe: That spot looks pretty cool! I love how excited you sound hahah
"
3085,"[5/30/20, 1:49:45 PM] Joe: You always with the drink in hand 🍻
"
3086,"[5/30/20, 1:51:07 PM] Joe: I don’t know why but I love when you say something is “super bien” hahaha that’s probably so random but it’s true 😂
"
3087,"[5/30/20, 1:56:51 PM] Joe: Ooh that sounds like my favorite kind of place. With no people haha. So weird that they let you go to a bar but not into nature. A bar seems much more likely to get you sick than sunbathing at a cool spot like that. I hope they don’t catch you hahah

3089,"[5/30/20, 1:58:46 PM] Joe: I like the phrase “super bien” when you say it. 
"
3090,"[5/30/20, 2:07:26 PM] Joe: I like that you all wanted to go to a spot like that, even though you’re not supposed to haha
"
3091,"[5/30/20, 2:08:36 PM] Joe: Glad you had a good time.
"
3092,"[5/30/20, 2:09:25 PM] Joe: Yeah I can definitely hear it in your voice. Makes me wonder what you sound like when your mad 😡 hahaa I cant imagine it
"
3093,"[5/30/20, 2:19:46 PM] Joe: Yeah skated a lot yesterday so I’m a liiittle sore today. But I still went to skate early this morning. I need to be ready for summer cause everyday will be a long day of skating. My skateboard is falling apart but I’m so close to going back I need to make it last. 
"
3094,"[5/30/20, 2:21:07 PM] Joe: Which reminds me...you still have to show me your 3d model you made sometime, even though you don’t like it. I’m not going to forget haha
"
3095,"[5/30/20, 2:31:29 PM] Joe: Just helping to make some visual changes to a website for someone. It’s a website I worked on previously.
"
3096,"[5/30/20, 2:33:07 PM] Joe: Haha damn back to work. I really hope we keep talking as things get back to normal. I’m still practicing my spanish everyday 😂
"
3097,"[5/30/20, 2:38:48 PM] Joe: Haha It’ll definitely be a little more effort to keep in touch but I’ll do my best.
"
3098,"[5/30/20, 2:41:05 PM] Joe: But I do want to make that if it becomes too much or too difficult that you’ll say something. Just be honest about everything is all I really ask.
"
3099,"[5/30/20, 2:45:37 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll send the link when it’s done ✅
"
3100,"[5/30/20, 2:50:55 PM] Joe: Hmm....if you feel like continuing to talk to me is too much effort or you’re just not into it anymore for whatever reason, I want you to communicate that to me
"
3101,"[5/30/20, 2:56:51 PM] Joe: I don’t want to stop talking to you for any reason and I know you feel the same.

3110,"[5/30/20, 3:41:55 PM] Joe: I made one. But it’s ugly. I use it to show clients that I can make stuff haha. Although most of my clients so far I’ve got from word of mouth(referrals)
"
3111,"[5/30/20, 3:43:07 PM] Joe: I need to add more projects that I’ve done and do a complete redesign of the look. But I suck at design so I need to hire someone haha
"
3112,"[5/30/20, 3:53:57 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s true. I did do a bunch of work to make sure it looks good on mobile
"
3113,"[5/30/20, 3:54:55 PM] Joe: 😬
"
3114,"[5/30/20, 3:55:45 PM] Joe: I don’t know I just don’t think it looks good. I should make it more “professional” looking. Straight lines, black and white, you know like a modern look
"
3115,"[5/30/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: It could be cleaner. And the section where i show my work could be done better. Especially as I add more projects
"
3116,"[5/30/20, 3:58:21 PM] Joe: I’ll take I’ll the help I can get but you don’t have to haha
"

"
3118,"[5/30/20, 4:04:56 PM] Joe: That is the files with the code but even that should have a better “readMe” that explains what it was
"
3119,"[5/30/20, 4:06:08 PM] Joe: That wasn’t a website. It was some code that automated the process of transferring scores from one website to another for my friend that is a teacher. It’s hard to display stuff like that in a portfolio haha
"
3120,"[5/30/20, 4:07:06 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
3121,"[5/30/20, 4:07:34 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3122,"[5/30/20, 4:10:44 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s because I didn’t finish it yet. 
"
3123,"[5/30/20, 4:11:17 PM] Joe: I’m still waiting on my friend to give me the items and all the info I need.
"
3124,"[5/30/20, 4:17:37 PM] Joe: The portfolio? What are you doing hahah
"
3125,"‎[5/30/20, 4:18:29 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
3126,"[5/30/20, 4:18:55 PM] Joe: Oooh that’s a good idea
"
3127,"[5/30/20, 4:23:18 PM] Joe: Sounds like a lot of work haha I agree on the colors and maybe a picture would be good too.
"
3128,"[5/30/20, 4:24:10 PM] Joe: I don’t know how I’d do the layout to make the blocks better like you say
"
3129,"[5/30/20, 4:24:50 PM] Joe: Mmm ok ok
"
3130,"[5/30/20, 4:25:52 PM] Joe: But then I need to have a design for both mobile and desktop
"
3131,"[5/30/20, 4:26:10 PM] Joe: Oh siiiick. Alright I’ll take a look at this
"
3132,"[5/30/20, 4:30:11 PM] Joe: Haha true
"
3133,"[5/30/20, 4:30:53 PM] Joe: I was thinking I should get a book in spanish haha.
"
3134,"[5/30/20, 4:31:40 PM] Joe: Oh also, I want to make a simple website that is basically flash cards with the words in the list that I made
"
3135,"[5/30/20, 4:32:49 PM] Joe: 😂 no te gusta?
"
3136,"[5/30/20, 4:34:31 PM] Joe: Hmm “flash cards” is like in school you write on a card to study. You put a question on the front and answer on the back.
"
3137,"[5/30/20, 4:35:15 PM] Joe: I want to make a my own flash cards but on the computer cause it would be more fun than writing them on actual cards haha
"
3138,"[5/30/20, 4:37:10 PM] Joe: Yeah I really like the first one. Very clean, lots of attention to detail.
"
3139,"[5/30/20, 4:37:40 PM] Joe: Oh yeah language. The list of your words
"
3140,"[5/30/20, 4:40:02 PM] Joe: Haha now I need a new design and a photo shoot
"
3141,"[5/30/20, 4:44:02 PM] Joe: Not at all. I usually make it functional before doing the design but maybe if I do the design first it will come out better.
"
3142,"[5/30/20, 4:44:11 PM] Joe: I won’t have to make so many changes either
"
3143,"[5/30/20, 4:48:56 PM] Joe: Alright if you say so. Ask questions anytime haha
"
3144,"[5/30/20, 4:49:07 PM] Joe: Gracias!
"
3145,"[5/30/20, 4:49:48 PM] Joe: I’ll talk to you later. Buenas nochesss

3149,"[5/31/20, 3:55:10 PM] Joe: Haha no worries
"
3150,"[5/31/20, 3:55:37 PM] Joe: Well I was this morning haha I had coffee and did my usual morning stuff so I’m good now
"
3151,"[5/31/20, 3:57:48 PM] Joe: Super bien haha
"
3152,"[5/31/20, 3:58:56 PM] Joe: No class today yet. I might call later though. How was your day? You must be stoked to have your friend there with you now.
"
3153,"[5/31/20, 3:59:21 PM] Joe: Does this mean I’m a secret haha
"
3154,"[5/31/20, 4:05:30 PM] Joe: Yeah that should give her some decent time and space to think about stuff. And she’s with a friend so it seems healthy.

3156,"[5/31/20, 4:10:59 PM] Joe: Your message translated to you not wanting to reveal me. So i was asking does Luchi not know about me? I was just playing around though haha
"
3157,"[5/31/20, 4:12:08 PM] Joe: Lit haha sounds like she will have a great month there 😂

3160,"[5/31/20, 4:21:41 PM] Joe: Do you have any fun plans before you have to go back to work? You have to take advantage of the time you have left haha
"
3161,"[5/31/20, 4:22:39 PM] Joe: Hahaha whatever dude
"
3162,"[5/31/20, 4:29:19 PM] Joe: Siiick. Yeah I’m trying to take advantage of my time out here. Just about 1 week to go 😞
"
3163,"[5/31/20, 4:30:48 PM] Joe: Remember when we first started talking it felt like it would never end? Haha now we’re counting down the days
"
3164,"[5/31/20, 4:36:09 PM] Joe: No I didn’t find anything online so I’m just going to go to my parents for a bit while I look in person. 
"
3165,"[5/31/20, 4:41:47 PM] Joe: It goes until school starts at in August. I think it’s about 10 weeks total.
"
3166,"[5/31/20, 4:44:47 PM] Joe: It’s only a daytime thing so just lessons in the park. The kids are dropped off weekday mornings and picked up every afternoon.
"
3167,"[5/31/20, 4:45:48 PM] Joe: We also have a building that has games and stuff in it but I’m not sure how much we’ll be using that stuff this year. It’s going to be really weird, with a bunch of special rules this year.
"
3168,"[5/31/20, 4:51:04 PM] Joe: I think they’re going to limit it to 10 children per “session”. The sessions used to be 1 week but now I think they’ll be 2 or 4 weeks so that the kids aren’t switching camps as often.
"
3169,"[5/31/20, 4:52:27 PM] Joe: I’m wondering how much staff they’ll give us though. Last year we had the bare minimum. We definitely could’ve used one more staff member. 
"
3170,"[5/31/20, 4:58:54 PM] Joe: Hahah I hope a lot of kids sign up. I’m pretty sure we can get at least 10 haha.
"
3171,"[5/31/20, 4:59:21 PM] Joe: I don’t know how many teachers we get. Hopefully 3. They’ll probably try to make us do it with 2(me and one other)
"
3172,"[5/31/20, 5:47:34 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. As long as this one kid from last year doesn’t come it’ll be all good 😂
"
3173,"[5/31/20, 6:06:08 PM] Joe: Oook talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
"
3174,"[6/1/20, 5:21:12 AM] Joe: Damn was I must’ve fallen asleep so early to not see your messages. I’m sorry. Good afternoon haha
"
3175,"[6/1/20, 5:22:51 AM] Joe: You’re hella sweet. I miss talking to you too babe. I’ll be up in a few hours I’m sure haha. Ok I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soooon 😘

3180,"[6/1/20, 10:31:52 AM] Joe: Can’t come soon enough
"
3181,"[6/1/20, 10:44:53 AM] Joe: Hahaha whaaat, he fell? That sucks haha. That’s good you’re helping.
"
3182,"[6/1/20, 10:47:44 AM] Joe: Ow that sucks too haha.
"
3183,"[6/1/20, 10:48:06 AM] Joe: Aaayyyyeee Peruvian in the house hahah niiiice. I don’t meet many Peruvians
"
3184,"[6/1/20, 10:58:01 AM] Joe: Hahaha I definitely noticed that part. His accent reminds me of some of the cartoon characters that are in those casi creativo videos 😂 Hard to hear him super well though.
"
3185,"[6/1/20, 11:03:44 AM] Joe: Hahaha woah 😱
"
3186,"[6/1/20, 11:08:27 AM] Joe: I was a little worried at first until he started laughing hahah what a tumble
"
3187,"[6/1/20, 11:31:04 AM] Joe: Ooooh then you would like some of my favorite Instagram pages hahaha
"
3188,"[6/1/20, 11:31:26 AM] Joe: https://instagram.com/americasgotnotalent?igshid=1heth6katuvvk

3189,"[6/1/20, 11:32:29 AM] Joe: I was going to send girlsGettingHurt but I see you follow them already hahah. Nice

"
3192,"[6/1/20, 11:53:40 AM] Joe: I’m glad you like those kind of videos. Some people don’t find it funny at all. I fall all the time and I still think it’s hilarious
"
3193,"[6/1/20, 12:03:17 PM] Joe: Oh yeah of course! But I’m glad you find it funny when they’re not hurt. You’ll enjoy watching me skateboard in person, I fall a lot 😂

3195,"[6/1/20, 12:11:59 PM] Joe: If we spend enough time together I’m sure you’ll see me hurt myself pretty bad eventually haha I’ve accepted that injuries are a part of skateboarding by this point
"
3196,"[6/1/20, 12:13:45 PM] Joe: Only 7 days until I leave this place 😩 
"
3197,"[6/1/20, 12:20:22 PM] Joe: Hmmm I’ll probably just skate around a bunch. Go to the beaches near by. Just enjoy the week as much as I can.

3199,"[6/1/20, 12:54:17 PM] Joe: Aún no. Voy a llamar por la tarde.
"
3200,"[6/1/20, 12:58:11 PM] Joe: I wanted to ask you something...I heard in a video that people say “voy a la calle” or “vamos a la calle” for saying they are going out or let’s go out(with no specific place in mind). 
"
3201,"[6/1/20, 12:59:05 PM] Joe: For example, is “voy a ir a la calle a patinar” correct?
"
3202,"[6/1/20, 1:02:10 PM] Joe: I guess I could just just say it as “voy a patinar” to make it easy. But I still want to know if the other way is technically correct haha
"
3203,"[6/1/20, 1:34:59 PM] Joe: Haha cool. Gracias
"
3204,"[6/1/20, 1:35:22 PM] Joe: Well I did go skate but I didn’t make it far before my bearing broke so now my wheel doesn’t turn. Had to walk back
"
3205,"[6/1/20, 1:39:18 PM] Joe: I was so close to making it back without anything breaking haha. The metal parts were getting rusty so it was only a matter of time I guess
"
3206,"[6/1/20, 1:43:08 PM] Joe: Haha maybe I’ll have to see if the skate shop is open. 
"
3207,"[6/1/20, 1:43:26 PM] Joe: I have to write this down in my notebook haha
"
3208,"[6/1/20, 1:44:33 PM] Joe: Anytime you notice a phrase I would use with you often or one you would use all the time with me, tell me the right way and I’ll write it down haha
"
3209,"[6/1/20, 1:48:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
3210,"[6/1/20, 1:48:51 PM] Joe: Damn these are funny haha you don’t have to come up with them right away 😂 😂
"
3211,"[6/1/20, 1:48:57 PM] Joe: Hahah you have so many already
"
3212,"[6/1/20, 1:49:01 PM] Joe: Niiice
"
3213,"[6/1/20, 1:50:08 PM] Joe: Well I guess I should switch it up. Surprise you hahah shit
"
3214,"[6/1/20, 1:51:04 PM] Joe: Oh god hahaha
"
3215,"[6/1/20, 1:51:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck I can’t believe you still talk to me since these are the things I say
"

"
3217,"[6/1/20, 1:55:43 PM] Joe: Ok I didn’t think you’d have so many haha. This gets a new page in the notebook.
"
3218,"[6/1/20, 1:56:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you remembered a lot of stuff haha. I’m a little surprised
"
3219,"[6/1/20, 1:58:45 PM] Joe: Still need stuff you say to me all the time ...or stuff you would say all the time if we we’re in the same place for example. 
"
3220,"[6/1/20, 2:05:16 PM] Joe: Haha I remember things we talked about more than specific phrases. You are more unpredictable than me with 1000 more words 😂
"
3221,"[6/1/20, 2:09:44 PM] Joe: But I guess what I really want is phrases you would say often if we were together. Simple everyday stuff like asking if I can get you something or if I want to do some activity or go somewhere with you. 
"
3222,"[6/1/20, 2:10:57 PM] Joe: Not now though haha. Just think about it and if you notice a phrase being used often throughout the day, even if it seems basic to you, tell me what it is. Then I can work on different responses
"
3223,"[6/1/20, 2:53:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah those are good. Stuff like that. That way i can think about and practice different responses until it is more natural
"

3225,"[6/1/20, 2:59:08 PM] Joe: Hopefully you don’t need this one too often 😂

"
3229,"[6/1/20, 3:36:20 PM] Joe: Since I’m the kind of person that only talks to a few people, it is especially frustrating for me that my favorite person to talk to has the most barriers for communication haha
"
3230,"[6/1/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha Lo siento 😂
"
3231,"[6/1/20, 3:44:07 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate it. I want to be with you so bad, but I’ll keep my mushy bullshit to a minimum so you can sleep haha
"
3232,"[6/1/20, 3:49:34 PM] Joe: Haha I just tell you those things at the wrong time
"
3233,"[6/1/20, 3:52:28 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
3234,"[6/1/20, 3:53:17 PM] Joe: Gets right into it. I love those kind of videos. Kids doing funny shit when they’re sleepy hahah

"
3246,"[6/1/20, 4:15:12 PM] Joe: My hair is fucked up today. Ignore it hahahah
"
3247,"[6/1/20, 4:17:25 PM] Joe: The one day I don’t shower when I get back from skating and you’re asking for videos hahaha I look all ridiculous
"
3248,"[6/1/20, 4:18:32 PM] Joe: Haha yeah that’s his Hawaii hat. He leaves it here for when he visits 😂
"
3249,"[6/1/20, 4:19:31 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
3250,"[6/1/20, 4:19:43 PM] Joe: You like when I wear the hats?
"
3251,"[6/1/20, 4:20:25 PM] Joe: Oh...I mean, go to sleep hahaha stop talking to me about random stuff 😂
"
3252,"[6/1/20, 4:21:42 PM] Joe: Haha I want to talk to you I’m just playing cause you said not to talk a certain way when you’re getting sleepy. I don’t want to keep you up
"
3253,"[6/1/20, 4:22:01 PM] Joe: Well...I do want to keep you up hahaha but if you’re tired I want you to sleep

"
3256,"[6/1/20, 4:27:47 PM] Joe: Haha nice. I feel like this is me too. I lay down and pass out super fast most of the time. I sleep so fast I need to be careful with getting to comfortable or I’ll fall asleep on accident 😂
"
3257,"[6/1/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: I’ve been trying to watch movies lately and I keep falling asleep hella early on the couch
"
3258,"[6/1/20, 4:31:51 PM] Joe: Hah why? Will you fall asleep too? Sounds great haha
"
3259,"[6/1/20, 4:33:25 PM] Joe: Don’t ever feel bad. My sleep schedule is super random sometimes but I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a while and that’s when I see those messages. I don’t mind waking up to a message from you at all. Sometimes I feel bad for not being able to respond cause I was asleep haha
"
3260,"[6/1/20, 4:34:02 PM] Joe: Perfect. If we want to get a little nap we’ll just put on a movie and cuddle on the couch haha
"
3261,"[6/1/20, 4:35:03 PM] Joe: I wouldn’t mind you falling asleep haha no biggie
"
3262,"[6/1/20, 4:39:43 PM] Joe: Send them all haha. I’ll let you know if it bothers me but I enjoy it so don’t expect me to complain

"
3266,"[6/1/20, 4:43:58 PM] Joe: I know how to turn you on hahaha
"
3267,"[6/1/20, 4:44:08 PM] Joe: Good old Mr Bean dance 😂
"
3268,"[6/1/20, 4:46:17 PM] Joe: Hahaha it’s the only way to know for sure. Ok I’ll try it with you one day. When you least expect it
"
3269,"[6/1/20, 4:47:13 PM] Joe: Pure talent haha
"
3270,"[6/1/20, 4:48:18 PM] Joe: I hope you realize I’m hella goofy and really would do some shit like dance like an idiot just to make you laugh haha. Don’t be surprised when I do weird shit 😂
"
3271,"[6/1/20, 4:49:42 PM] Joe: It’s the total commitment to the joke haha. So good. Classic
"
3272,"[6/1/20, 4:52:37 PM] Joe: Hahahah I don’t know if I consider that seduction 😂 😂 but sure haha
"
3273,"[6/1/20, 4:53:56 PM] Joe: Are we strange for liking Mr Bean? Haha I think he is hella funny. I remember it being played in my families house when I was younger though so I may be biased
"

"
3335,"[6/2/20, 4:45:08 PM] Joe: Haha I understand. I don’t know about you but It feels real to me. It’s definitely a surprise how much we’ve connected over this time but I’m happy about it
"
3336,"[6/2/20, 4:54:11 PM] Joe: I still think this is hella funny. Especially after you sent me all the things I say often hahaha
"
3337,"[6/2/20, 4:54:43 PM] Joe: I just don’t understand what other dudes must be saying for me to keep you interested more than them 😂
"
3338,"[6/2/20, 5:39:10 PM] Joe: Hah it’s late that’s ok.
"
3339,"[6/2/20, 5:39:31 PM] Joe: You get some sleep. You can always talk to me tomorrow
"
3340,"[6/2/20, 5:40:57 PM] Joe: Dude I have sooo many mosquito bites right now hahah. I don’t know where I was when I got so many
"
3341,"[6/2/20, 5:42:18 PM] Joe: Haha all good you don’t have to respond to that. I was just saying, i feel like I’m boring 😆
"
3342,"[6/2/20, 5:47:35 PM] Joe: Aaaah ok. Whoops 😬
"
3343,"[6/2/20, 5:50:09 PM] Joe: Damn now I feel kind of bad haha
"
3344,"[6/2/20, 5:50:36 PM] Joe: I appreciate the honesty
"
3345,"[6/2/20, 5:50:44 PM] Joe: For him
"
3346,"[6/2/20, 5:52:11 PM] Joe: Cause yeah that must’ve been quiet the shock, especially after learning about the distance. 
"
3347,"[6/2/20, 5:52:39 PM] Joe: Quite*

"
3349,"[6/2/20, 5:57:47 PM] Joe: Hahaha I feel like I should be nervous about you, wild girl
"
3350,"[6/2/20, 6:01:44 PM] Joe: Haha nothing never mind. Don’t worry though I definitely am only interested in you. 100% all you
"
3351,"[6/2/20, 6:10:15 PM] Joe: Ok I’ll explain but don’t take it the wrong way because I love who you are as a person. Genuinely. 
"
3352,"[6/2/20, 6:11:38 PM] Joe: It’s less about me thinking you would do something inappropriate and more that I think I could end up liking you a little too much and get hurt for it. That’s life though, I either open up to you and see what happens or stay in my shell. The stay in the shell option might not be available to me anymore haha
"
3353,"[6/2/20, 6:16:25 PM] Joe: I never know if I explain these things well that’s why I say never mind 😂 I don’t know how to describe what I mean. I hope you get the idea
"
3354,"[6/2/20, 6:21:06 PM] Joe: Yeah I guess I’m just nervous about relationships in general. In that one video I sent you I told you I was planning on focusing on myself and wasn’t trying to talk to anyone like that. I don’t know how to describe it well
"
3355,"[6/2/20, 6:21:55 PM] Joe: I’m super glad I’m talking to you now. And I don’t want to stop or anything like that. I’m just saying that I wasn’t really expecting something like this
"
3356,"[6/2/20, 6:22:35 PM] Joe: I think the way previous relationships have ended make me a little guarded right now
"
3357,"[6/2/20, 6:26:07 PM] Joe: Fuck I really don’t want you to think anything negative about this cause it’s not like some huge deal, I’ve still been super open with you and share as much as I can. If any of that was too big of a deal for me I wouldn’t even be talking to you. It’s a small thing. I’m sure you feel a slight nervousness about getting hurt in the end as well but that’s the risk you take if you want to be with someone
"
3358,"[6/2/20, 6:28:33 PM] Joe: Hahah fuck 3:30am 😬 I’m so sorry 😂
"
3359,"[6/2/20, 6:29:13 PM] Joe: You can respond to this tomorrow if you want. No worries
"
3360,"[6/2/20, 6:29:48 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3361,"[6/2/20, 6:30:11 PM] Joe: All good. I’m sorry I opened up too much. Ok ok maybe you should just go to sleep haha
"
3362,"[6/2/20, 6:31:00 PM] Joe: Haha it’s complicated. We can talk about it some other time. It’s not a huge deal at all. Don’t worry
"
3363,"[6/2/20, 6:32:16 PM] Joe: Ok. Hmm I don’t know how to explain it in simple terms.
"
3364,"[6/2/20, 6:34:24 PM] Joe: Haha why couldn’t you just accept “never mind” 😂
"
3365,"[6/2/20, 6:36:13 PM] Joe: Hhahhha fuck
"
3366,"[6/2/20, 6:36:16 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3367,"[6/2/20, 6:37:01 PM] Joe: Ok I just had a bad breakup or two and I don’t want to go through that with you. I’m scared of having really strong feelings for you
"
3368,"[6/2/20, 6:37:39 PM] Joe: There isn’t much more to it than that
"
3369,"[6/2/20, 6:41:21 PM] Joe: At this point I can’t do anything about it cause I already really like you soooo
"
3370,"[6/2/20, 6:42:59 PM] Joe: Ok 🙄
"
3371,"[6/2/20, 6:44:30 PM] Joe: Nah but for real...it’s not being nervous about being with you, it’s being nervous about losing you. I fucking hate sounding corny like that but that’s what it is
"
3372,"[6/2/20, 6:49:50 PM] Joe: This is why I shouldn’t tell you shit haha. I want to take it seriously with you, otherwise I wouldn’t be nervous at all. It wouldn’t matter. I’m sorry if what I’m saying is making you think I’m having doubts about trying to be with you because that’s not it
"
3373,"[6/2/20, 6:51:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I also was very ok with being single. But I would say you trapped me 😆
"
3374,"‎[6/2/20, 6:51:34 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
3375,"[6/2/20, 6:53:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha you were just going to message me until you lost interest but you couldn’t stop once you started 😂
"
3376,"[6/2/20, 6:54:55 PM] Joe: Good thing I didn’t speak Spanish and I have no idea how to talk to girls or you might have gotten bored by now
"
3377,"[6/2/20, 6:57:27 PM] Joe: You must be some kind of “hopeless romantic” haha. I like the story too and you got siiick vibes haha
"
3378,"[6/2/20, 6:59:30 PM] Joe: Haha damn sorry about that 😂 
"
3379,"[6/2/20, 7:00:09 PM] Joe: Then I started to think about it and there is nothing stopping me from making it happen, it’ll just take some time to get everything situated
"
3380,"[6/2/20, 7:03:27 PM] Joe: Haha I’m not changing my mind on us meeting. That’s the goal right now.
"
3381,"[6/2/20, 7:05:04 PM] Joe: When I get back to the bay I’m going to go do everything to get my passport and by the time that comes I should be able to visit you
"
3382,"[6/2/20, 7:06:59 PM] Joe: I don’t even know what the plan would be. Like how long do I go and how it all works haha but I’ll figure it out.
"
3383,"[6/2/20, 7:07:45 PM] Joe: Hahah naaah I don’t think that’ll be a problem at all
"

"
3387,"[6/2/20, 7:10:41 PM] Joe: “I only have eyes for you” hahaha I just need summer to go by quickly so I can get to you. Things have to be open by then
"
3388,"[6/2/20, 7:12:15 PM] Joe: Hahahah what the hell 😂
"
3389,"[6/2/20, 7:14:11 PM] Joe: Hahah dude you should be asleep 😂 I’m so sorry for keeping you up so long with all this.
"
3390,"[6/2/20, 7:16:35 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s true, no work. You’re going to be sleeping all day haha
"
3391,"[6/2/20, 7:17:55 PM] Joe: Yeah definitely the latest you’ve stayed up haha
"
3392,"[6/2/20, 7:18:26 PM] Joe: 😂

3393,"[6/2/20, 7:19:12 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok I’m going to shut up now
"
3394,"[6/2/20, 7:23:27 PM] Joe: Haha and me blahblahblah?? Damn I’m lame as fuck
"
3395,"[6/2/20, 7:24:13 PM] Joe: You probably thought I was saying I don’t want to meet you or something haha. Damn I bet all that sounded so weird when you read it
"
3396,"[6/2/20, 7:24:39 PM] Joe: Don’t get confused. I want to meet you and I’ll be very direct about it if that changes.
"
3397,"[6/2/20, 7:24:42 PM] Joe: But it won’t haha
"
3398,"[6/2/20, 7:30:11 PM] Joe: 😂 aaah I can only imagine what was going through your mind. That’s pretty funny hahah
"
3399,"[6/2/20, 7:31:51 PM] Joe: No big deal for me but it ended up keeping you awake for 2 more hours
"
3400,"[6/2/20, 7:32:25 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️
"
3401,"[6/2/20, 7:32:51 PM] Joe: I want you to get good sleep that’s all Hahahaha

"
3413,"[6/2/20, 8:05:36 PM] Joe: Good. Because I just want to be all over you so much it’s hard to describe. I want to feel your body against mine and do whatever makes you feel good babe

3448,"[6/2/20, 9:13:21 PM] Joe: Hahah I had a lot of fun talking to you today and I’m glad we “explored” a little more.
"
3449,"[6/2/20, 9:13:44 PM] Joe: Sleep well babe. I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
"
3450,"[6/3/20, 12:01:58 PM] Joe: I just saw a mosquito in my room! I tried to kill it but I missed and now I can’t see it. Little fucker has probably been biting me for days!
"
3451,"[6/3/20, 12:24:39 PM] Joe: Haha yeah mosquito are terrible. That’s why I like those carnivorous plants. Nature’s mosquito trap haha
"
3452,"[6/3/20, 12:25:09 PM] Joe: I sleep pretty good. Didn’t fall asleep on the couch so that probably helped.
"
3453,"[6/3/20, 2:44:29 PM] Joe: Oooh it was good. I didn’t take many notes today. Just listened to Nelly talk about when she moved to the US in the 60s. Interesting stuff haha
"
3454,"[6/3/20, 3:07:40 PM] Joe: Haha yeah this was me today. All kinds of stuff about not speaking English, having to sit in the back of the bus, crazy neighbors
"
3455,"[6/3/20, 3:07:44 PM] Joe: Good stuff
"
3456,"[6/3/20, 3:16:16 PM] Joe: Yeah she tells me everything in spanish but when I don’t understand she can explain in English
"
3457,"[6/3/20, 3:21:56 PM] Joe: Hmmm what to tell you 🤔
"
3458,"[6/3/20, 3:24:27 PM] Joe: Hahah I really don’t know what to tell you in spanish cause I didn’t write much down. I have a hard enough time translating it in my head. I can remember what she said but in my head it’s in english. I couldn’t tell you the exact phrases in Spanish unless I use the translator 🤦‍♂️
"
3459,"[6/3/20, 3:25:39 PM] Joe: I still don’t hear or understand every word so I can only piece together the idea of what is being said.
"

"
3461,"[6/3/20, 3:29:32 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. I’ll get it down
"
3462,"[6/3/20, 3:30:13 PM] Joe: So what time did you wake up today? You stayed up helllla late haha. Sun was probably coming up as you went to sleep
"
3463,"[6/3/20, 4:03:36 PM] Joe: Haha I had to listen so many times! You didn’t nap?? I would have haha
"
3464,"[6/3/20, 4:03:38 PM] Joe: You should send videos or audio to me everyday until I don’t have to listen multiple times to understand hahah.
"
3465,"[6/3/20, 4:16:48 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate the subtitles. I understood the ideas like waking at 9, the dog crying at the door, coffee and toast with your friends for breakfast, 3d course, no nap and shower haha
"
3466,"[6/3/20, 4:17:44 PM] Joe: I miss a bunch in between and I don’t hear a lot of the words but I kind of know what you say. Good to be able to read it so I can catch all the words
"
3467,"[6/3/20, 4:21:48 PM] Joe: Yeah we’ll wait until I’m a little better at spanish before you send the videos after drinking coffee
"
3468,"[6/3/20, 4:22:19 PM] Joe: Oh god I can only imagine what it sounds like when you talk really fast. Blahblahblahblah I wouldn’t understand shit
"
3469,"[6/3/20, 4:26:38 PM] Joe: If you spoke English it would be so easy for me to learn from you hahah. I feel like I can understand Nelly waaaaay better after a few weeks of talking almost everyday
"
3470,"[6/3/20, 4:28:39 PM] Joe: Now I really have to expand my vocabulary, because I’ll end up understanding most of a sentence but not knowing one or two words throws me off haha.  But I’m finally started to understand the basic rules I better
"
3471,"[6/3/20, 4:35:30 PM] Joe: Sí, definitivamente es más fácil pero hay tantas palabras jaja
"
3472,"[6/3/20, 4:36:14 PM] Joe: Nunca termina
"
3473,"[6/3/20, 4:39:09 PM] Joe: Oook. Get more than 3 hours of sleep today haha. Sleep well babe. Buenas noches
"
3474,"[6/3/20, 4:39:17 PM] Joe: 😘
"
3475,"[6/3/20, 11:07:34 PM] Joe: Hahahah not what I expected 😂 😂
"
3476,"[6/3/20, 11:08:07 PM] Joe: Lucky little dog haha. Buenos días babe
"
3477,"[6/3/20, 11:09:30 PM] Joe: Hahaha you definitely got me for a second. I was like what the hell is she doing. And it was so dark and hard to see.
"
3478,"[6/3/20, 11:10:12 PM] Joe: Mmmm I’m going to take the dogs place haha so jealous

3482,"[6/3/20, 11:26:32 PM] Joe: I like all the pictures and videos lately. You’ve been sending them more often. Keep them coming haha
"
3483,"[6/3/20, 11:34:04 PM] Joe: Mmmm it’s hard to pick a favorite haha I like the ones you just sent me. I always love the leg pictures 😂 
"
3484,"[6/3/20, 11:41:00 PM] Joe: Haha Ok talk to you later 😘

"
3488,"[6/4/20, 10:42:31 AM] Joe: I had a dream last night I was living with some people I didn’t know and they spoke spanish 😂 that was the first time anyone has spoke Spanish in my dream. So weird
"
3489,"[6/4/20, 10:55:24 AM] Joe: All I remember for sure was they asked if I wanted to eat hahaha there was more but I can’t remember. I also don’t remember if I said anything
"
3490,"[6/4/20, 10:56:13 AM] Joe: Damn it was so much clearer when I first woke up haha I should’ve just put as much detail as I could in that first message.
"
3491,"[6/4/20, 10:56:53 AM] Joe: “Quieres comer algo?” Haha
"
3492,"[6/4/20, 10:57:13 AM] Joe: That’s all I can remember
"
3493,"[6/4/20, 11:07:00 AM] Joe: Hopefully spanish in my dreams is a good sign that I’m picking it up.
"
3494,"[6/4/20, 11:07:43 AM] Joe: It was so weird though. I was living with some family I didn’t know
"
3495,"[6/4/20, 11:07:44 AM] Joe: Damn
"
3496,"[6/4/20, 11:07:51 AM] Joe: I thought it was coming back to me ahaha
"
3497,"[6/4/20, 11:09:17 AM] Joe: Hhmmm there was an older lady, and a younger man 🤔 she was at a table, the room was small and kind of dark, didn’t feel like a house you find in the US
"
3498,"[6/4/20, 11:10:01 AM] Joe: Shit that’s all I got. I’m going to write it down next time right when I wake up if it happens again.
"
3499,"[6/4/20, 11:14:11 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve had a dream about you I just didn’t tell you 🙊🙈
"
3500,"[6/4/20, 11:19:34 AM] Joe: Haha no it wasn’t bad. I can barely remember anything that happened in the dream now cause that was about a week ago. All I really remember is we were together. It was a good dream
"
3501,"[6/4/20, 11:24:27 AM] Joe: Haha I didn’t want to seem weird and message you all excited that I had a dream about you 😂
"
3502,"[6/4/20, 11:29:19 AM] Joe: Alright well if I have another dream and you’re in it, I’ll let you know haha

3504,"[6/4/20, 11:37:12 AM] Joe: Hahah true
"
3505,"[6/4/20, 11:38:28 AM] Joe: It’s so weird how we live in such different places. You’re so fucking far 😂
"
3506,"[6/4/20, 11:39:32 AM] Joe: I still don’t believe it sometimes how far you are. Never would I have imagined being in this situation

"
3510,"[6/4/20, 11:50:35 AM] Joe: What?
"
3511,"[6/4/20, 11:53:59 AM] Joe: Haha that sounds fun to me.
"
3512,"[6/4/20, 11:54:05 AM] Joe: Tell me all the ideas you come up with.
"
3513,"[6/4/20, 11:55:06 AM] Joe: I mean I’m down to try it out. I have a friend that lives in a van with his dog and has a YouTube channel hahaha
"
3514,"[6/4/20, 11:56:36 AM] Joe: No I haven’t. I wanted to try it for a while but I never did. 
"
3515,"[6/4/20, 11:57:32 AM] Joe: But with you I’d be fine with trying it in a van or motor home Haha keep it simple
"
3516,"[6/4/20, 12:00:33 PM] Joe: Van or motor home is way better for actually moving around often but I always wanted to build something like the houses on this page. 
"
3517,"[6/4/20, 12:02:04 PM] Joe: One more 
"
3518,"[6/4/20, 12:05:13 PM] Joe: I love how some of the designs look. Like full size house shrunk down
"
3519,"[6/4/20, 12:06:42 PM] Joe: I did a lot of research on building a super tiny house haha. It’s so cool cause you can spend money on really high quality material since you don’t need as much material to build small.
"
3520,"[6/4/20, 12:07:12 PM] Joe: Probably cost between $40,000-60,000 to build a really nice tiny house
"
3521,"[6/4/20, 12:08:18 PM] Joe: Ooh that one is nice. The hardest part is finding land to park your house on but damn I hella want one 😂

"
3523,"[6/4/20, 12:11:54 PM] Joe: Hahah if we built a tiny house and lived in the middle of nowhere with some dogs our YouTube channel would be great
"
3524,"[6/4/20, 12:12:34 PM] Joe: Hahahah so embarrassing but I was definitely going to film the process of building the house and make a channel about the house
"
3525,"[6/4/20, 12:13:15 PM] Joe: Hahah yes. It would be perfect
"
3526,"[6/4/20, 12:14:57 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
3527,"[6/4/20, 12:14:59 PM] Joe: Shit

"
3531,"[6/4/20, 12:20:19 PM] Joe: Very true. That’s why I like YouTube. For almost every topic you can find people sharing information just because they want to share it.
"
3532,"[6/4/20, 12:22:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha still roasting me 😂
"
3533,"[6/4/20, 12:24:24 PM] Joe: I have fun making videos so it’s whatever. It’s always a little bit embarrassing when people find them but it’s just me doing things I like to do and saying things I know so it shouldn’t be a big deal.
"
3534,"[6/4/20, 12:25:04 PM] Joe: For me that is. It shouldn’t be a big deal for me
"
3535,"[6/4/20, 12:26:05 PM] Joe: But you can poke fun. I enjoy your button pushing. I’m just saying, making stuff like that is weird in the way that you put yourself out there for people to judge you
"
3536,"[6/4/20, 12:27:58 PM] Joe: Hahah I know i know
"
3537,"[6/4/20, 12:28:12 PM] Joe: No biggie
"
3538,"[6/4/20, 12:29:34 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry I know. I’m just saying what I’m thinking. I don’t take it negatively from you at all. I know you like them and you joke with me in a caring and fun way.
"
3539,"[6/4/20, 12:33:37 PM] Joe: I’m just glad you’re not a girl that is obsessed with those kind of videos haha
"
3540,"[6/4/20, 12:34:59 PM] Joe: I watch so much random shit I can’t judge what other people watch though 🤷‍♂️
"
3541,"[6/4/20, 12:40:00 PM] Joe: I love these pictures
"
3542,"[6/4/20, 12:40:27 PM] Joe: Hahah cute
"
3543,"[6/4/20, 12:40:52 PM] Joe: This is a cool place to wash dishes
"
3544,"[6/4/20, 12:42:33 PM] Joe: You’re such a little hippie girl hahah It’s great
"
3545,"[6/4/20, 12:49:10 PM] Joe: Aw hella cute. You and the dog haha
"
3546,"[6/4/20, 12:51:11 PM] Joe: Dogs and beer. Two of the most frequent things in your photos hahah
"
3547,"[6/4/20, 12:57:53 PM] Joe: You read that beer has lots of benefits? Hahah nice.

"
3553,"[6/4/20, 1:22:09 PM] Joe: Hahah beer and pancakes? Weird 😂
"
3554,"[6/4/20, 1:55:25 PM] Joe: I’ll have to try it sometime. I have literally never heard of such a thing
"
3555,"[6/4/20, 2:16:35 PM] Joe: Hahah damn you really enjoy your beer 😂 that’s cool though. All these things sound strange to me but if you like it, I won’t judge haha
"
3556,"[6/4/20, 2:17:03 PM] Joe: I never would’ve thought to try those combinations haha
"
3557,"[6/4/20, 2:22:50 PM] Joe: Haha all good. If that’s what you like it’s fine with me.
"
3558,"[6/4/20, 2:24:04 PM] Joe: As long as you’re not as drunk as Tokyo in that one episode when Rio comes back. Hahaha i was watching it yesterday, super drunk spanish sounds hilarious
"
3559,"[6/4/20, 2:25:31 PM] Joe: I also realized the hardest character for me to understand is Denver. I don’t know why, maybe he just talks the fastest or something but can never understand him
"
3560,"[6/4/20, 4:02:16 PM] Joe: Hahah I believe you. I just would love to go out and spend some time with “content” you 😂
"
3561,"[6/4/20, 4:03:46 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m watching it again. I can understand more this time but what I do is I’ll watch it and if there is an interesting scene I watch it once with spanish subtitles to know what words they’re using, then again with English subtitles while listening for the words I read the first time. It’s a weird way to study haha
"
3562,"[6/4/20, 4:04:34 PM] Joe: I feel like the subtitles don’t match what he says a lot of the time. Or at least more often than the other characters
"
3563,"[6/4/20, 4:05:51 PM] Joe: Like he was in the bathroom and said he didn’t hear anything. Sounds like he says “escucho nada” but the subtitles were like “no .. ... oido”
"
3564,"[6/4/20, 4:13:13 PM] Joe: Hah I’m missing some filler words that the subtitles had but I listened to it so many times cause I was like, “no way he is saying that” haha
"
3565,"[6/4/20, 4:13:50 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure I will
"
3566,"[6/4/20, 4:14:13 PM] Joe: I can never understand Denver though. It’s so weird.

"
3570,"[6/4/20, 4:26:44 PM] Joe: Green is my favorite color haha and I love nature
"
3571,"[6/4/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: South sounds interesting too haha
"
3572,"[6/4/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha you’re going to induce analysis paralysis with all these options 😂
"
3573,"[6/4/20, 4:29:41 PM] Joe: I can only stay for 90 days unless I apply for some kind of visa or something right? I’ll have to get all that figured out and we need to narrow down a plan haha shit is complicated
"
3574,"[6/4/20, 4:38:41 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3575,"[6/4/20, 4:40:12 PM] Joe: So many options haha maybe instead of picking just one you can make a list and we can live in each place until we find our favorite haha
"
3576,"[6/4/20, 4:48:24 PM] Joe: Is it impossible? I mean...we’re not THAT old haha and it’s not like we have to spend 10 years in each place or anything. Few years here few years there you know?
"
3577,"[6/4/20, 4:48:52 PM] Joe: In the future hahah
"
3578,"[6/4/20, 4:49:08 PM] Joe: But for now I don’t know, whatever works for you. I’ll go wherever
"
3579,"[6/4/20, 4:49:17 PM] Joe: Doesn’t matter too much to me where I am
"
3580,"[6/4/20, 4:50:45 PM] Joe: Spain sounds cool and like it has a wide variety of places. But whatever we can make work is where I’m going haha
"
3581,"[6/4/20, 4:52:13 PM] Joe: You pick the place and I’ll just meet you there
"
3582,"[6/4/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha shit
"
3583,"[6/4/20, 5:00:18 PM] Joe: Haha don’t shut up
"
3584,"[6/4/20, 5:00:36 PM] Joe: It’s all good
"
3585,"[6/4/20, 5:02:14 PM] Joe: Hmm it’s hard to describe but i really don’t mind too much the location as long as I have the necessities. And it would matter even less if I was with you.
"
3586,"[6/4/20, 5:02:59 PM] Joe: If the place is new to me it’s an adventure either way and I want to know all different kinds of places in the world
"
3587,"[6/4/20, 5:08:07 PM] Joe: Haha sweeeet. You’ll be my tour guide 😂
"
3588,"[6/4/20, 5:09:14 PM] Joe: I’ll be back in California in a few days and then I can actually start the process of getting everything setup to go
"
3589,"[6/4/20, 5:20:13 PM] Joe: I better make it there haha shit. 
"
3590,"[6/4/20, 5:32:47 PM] Joe: So no one has told you it’s a bad idea to meet me yet? Your brother must know about me, cause I saw him look at my Instagram story one time 😂 
"
3591,"[6/4/20, 5:37:51 PM] Joe: Haha whaaaat?
"
3592,"[6/4/20, 5:38:00 PM] Joe: Damn haha that’s funny
"
3593,"[6/4/20, 5:38:09 PM] Joe: Nosy brothers haha
"
3594,"[6/4/20, 5:41:03 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s when he saw mine. They couldn’t help themselves

"
3599,"[6/4/20, 5:50:10 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
3600,"[6/4/20, 5:50:14 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3601,"[6/4/20, 5:53:03 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I told Nelly haha she was just like “oooh that’s nice” haha But I didn’t tell her much except that “I have a friend that lives in Spain that I talk to and she only speaks Spanish”
"
3602,"[6/4/20, 5:53:42 PM] Joe: The rest of my family can find out when I have my plans to visit you more figured out
"
3603,"[6/4/20, 5:54:10 PM] Joe: Now I want to know what my brother thinks haha shit
"
3604,"[6/4/20, 5:57:12 PM] Joe: 😂 alright I’ll tell her and see what she says haha
"
3605,"[6/4/20, 5:58:07 PM] Joe: No he didn’t know anything haha. Probably looked at your page so confused.
"
3606,"[6/4/20, 5:58:23 PM] Joe: It’ll all make sense to him in the end haha
"
3607,"[6/4/20, 6:02:11 PM] Joe: Haha for real that’s the part that gets me. He was so curious he had to click the story 😂

"
3612,"[6/5/20, 12:16:20 PM] Joe: Almost. It’s mostly packed but I have a few things out to wear for the next few days.
"
3613,"[6/5/20, 12:16:59 PM] Joe: I found out I have some kind of training for the skate camp next week so I start work the day I get back instead of a week later. Throwing off all my plans haha

3614,"[6/5/20, 12:24:30 PM] Joe: I was hoping to use my free time in the first week back to find a place to stay and start on my passport stuff
"
3615,"[6/5/20, 12:27:42 PM] Joe: I get back on Monday night around midnight and have to be at work Tuesday morning haha. Shit
"
3616,"[6/5/20, 12:40:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
3617,"[6/5/20, 12:41:02 PM] Joe: I wish haha. It’s for training so it’ll be super boring all day meetings
"
3618,"[6/5/20, 12:45:25 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
3619,"[6/5/20, 12:48:20 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully I can find some time to go pick a new skateboard up. If not I can get it over the weekend
"
3620,"[6/5/20, 1:05:04 PM] Joe: Looks like it’s starting to get back to normal slowly. Lots of people.
"
3621,"[6/5/20, 1:05:34 PM] Joe: Haha what did you get for her?
"
3622,"[6/5/20, 1:18:11 PM] Joe: 😂
"
3623,"[6/5/20, 1:19:16 PM] Joe: Ah yeah I guess I’ve never seen it at normal levels. But compared to when you first started going out, it’s pretty busy haha
"
3624,"[6/5/20, 1:19:48 PM] Joe: That’s nice of you. Yeah good thing you had the music with you haha.
"
3625,"[6/5/20, 1:20:31 PM] Joe: I’m trying to draw a new design for my portfolio but I can’t come up with any good ideas. I’m trying to do the mobile phone design first then I’ll make another for bigger screens.
"
3626,"[6/5/20, 1:24:38 PM] Joe: Hahaha nooooo not yet. I don’t even have anything yet. I just started and I can’t draw shit haha
"

"
3628,"[6/5/20, 1:28:13 PM] Joe: Super simple sketches first then I’ll probably try to make it in a program like Adobe XD before coding it up. Going to go through the whole process this time haha. I kind of just went straight to coding the last version, that’s probably why it sucks haha
"
3629,"[6/5/20, 1:29:51 PM] Joe: I suck at designing stuff haha fuck
"
3630,"[6/5/20, 1:30:12 PM] Joe: My brain just loves to come up with ugly stuff haha
"
3631,"[6/5/20, 1:32:29 PM] Joe: Haha totally! I welcome your help.
"
3632,"[6/5/20, 1:39:35 PM] Joe: Siempre con un cerveza jaja 🍻

"
3637,"[6/5/20, 4:05:21 PM] Joe: Yeah I got a little bit done. I don’t know if I like it. Probably should draw another. Then I need to draw what it would look like on a bigger screen before I make the prototype in Adobe XD or figma.
"
3638,"[6/5/20, 4:05:31 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
"
3639,"[6/5/20, 4:05:50 PM] Joe: Hahahah whoops

3643,"[6/5/20, 4:22:02 PM] Joe: The one of my crappy sketch? Its terrible haha. I should practice sketching designs more often
"
3644,"[6/5/20, 4:33:34 PM] Joe: It’s a start haha. This will be the third time I try to design my portfolio. The one I showed you was version 2.
"
3645,"[6/5/20, 4:34:27 PM] Joe: jmvcode.com
"
3646,"[6/5/20, 4:37:41 PM] Joe: Don’t worry I hate the first one so much. I don’t even know why I made it like that haha. But that’s why I made the second one
"
3647,"[6/5/20, 4:41:44 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s an iterative process
"
3648,"[6/5/20, 4:42:08 PM] Joe: Just have to keep trying different things until I get an idea of what works and what doesn’t
"
3649,"[6/5/20, 5:13:16 PM] Joe: Hahahah 😂 aaah
"
3650,"[6/5/20, 5:13:23 PM] Joe: What’re you doing???

"
3653,"[6/5/20, 5:40:48 PM] Joe: Damn
"
3654,"[6/5/20, 5:41:53 PM] Joe: You’re good at that. Not even using the right tools and still make a nice looking design haha
"
3655,"[6/5/20, 5:42:09 PM] Joe: I would love to see what you could make if you used actual UO design tools
"
3656,"[6/5/20, 5:43:24 PM] Joe: Haha oh for sure I’m just saying, your stuff looks good and without the right tool so it’d probably look fairly professional if you ever use the other tools in the future
"
3657,"[6/5/20, 5:44:01 PM] Joe: But you did a pretty good job haha way better than me. Thank youuu
"
3658,"[6/5/20, 5:46:29 PM] Joe: Hahah siiii
"
3659,"[6/5/20, 5:47:33 PM] Joe: Alright cool. I’ll use that font
"
3660,"[6/5/20, 5:52:12 PM] Joe: Haha thanks design master
"
3661,"[6/5/20, 5:52:14 PM] Joe: So many tips
"
3662,"[6/5/20, 5:52:45 PM] Joe: I like the idea of removing the stack section and adding it to the about me
"
3663,"[6/5/20, 5:53:29 PM] Joe: Black and white is probably a good idea too and I’ll take a picture with another hat soon haha
"
3664,"[6/5/20, 5:55:55 PM] Joe: Haha no math for the next photo
"
3665,"[6/5/20, 5:56:39 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll let you know if I think of any other ideas.
"
3666,"[6/5/20, 5:57:45 PM] Joe: Haha the math one? That’s good to know 😂
"
3667,"[6/5/20, 5:57:54 PM] Joe: I like that hat 🧢
"
3668,"[6/5/20, 5:58:18 PM] Joe: But like you said, the hat is political so not great for a portfolio haha
"
3669,"[6/5/20, 6:06:20 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
3670,"[6/5/20, 6:06:47 PM] Joe: You talked to me thanks to my dude Andrew Yang 😂
"
3671,"[6/5/20, 6:14:30 PM] Joe: Oooh hahah that one is good too
"
3672,"[6/5/20, 6:14:39 PM] Joe: Siiiick
"
3673,"[6/5/20, 6:14:44 PM] Joe: That looks really good
"
3674,"[6/5/20, 6:15:21 PM] Joe: I like it
"
3675,"[6/5/20, 6:15:34 PM] Joe: Me gusta mucho or something haha
"
3676,"[6/5/20, 6:16:23 PM] Joe: Well it’s definitely better than what I was thinking of
"
3677,"[6/5/20, 6:16:41 PM] Joe: Looks professional
"
3678,"[6/5/20, 6:21:31 PM] Joe: From what I remember...much easier than that hahaa that looks complicated
"
3679,"[6/5/20, 6:22:17 PM] Joe: Or like a lot of unnecessary layers compared to how you build them with Adobe XD or Figma
"
3680,"[6/5/20, 6:25:28 PM] Joe: Haha thank you I really appreciate the work you put into that. Another design for your web design portfolio 💼
"
3681,"[6/5/20, 6:29:52 PM] Joe: Your sleep schedule is crazy right now haha you better get back on track before going back to work
"
3682,"[6/5/20, 6:30:57 PM] Joe: Staying up late and helping me with my portfolio design is hella sweet though 😘
"
3683,"[6/5/20, 6:41:30 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s going to be weird figuring out our new schedules haha
"
3684,"[6/5/20, 6:42:01 PM] Joe: And getting used to talking at different times
"
3685,"[6/5/20, 6:45:48 PM] Joe: You’ll just slowly forget about me 😂
"
3686,"[6/5/20, 6:46:51 PM] Joe: Taaaarde 
"
3687,"[6/5/20, 6:53:04 PM] Joe: Hahah we might miss a few days of talking here and there but it’ll be hard to forget when I’m making my plans to meet you
"
3688,"[6/5/20, 6:53:54 PM] Joe: And I only tell you to sleep cause I feel bad keeping you up all night
"
3689,"[6/5/20, 7:00:39 PM] Joe: Mmmm....never mind haha
"
3690,"[6/5/20, 7:01:20 PM] Joe: Haha I can’t lie, even though I feel bad keeping you up I’ll miss talking to you as much as we do now.
"
3691,"[6/5/20, 7:05:36 PM] Joe: I was trying to say there will probably be days we don’t talk because we’re too busy
"
3692,"[6/5/20, 7:06:55 PM] Joe: But that’s ok, I think it’s understood it’ll be a little more difficult. I’m still going to come visit you haha
"
3693,"[6/5/20, 7:10:57 PM] Joe: Alright babe sleep well. Talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘

"
3697,"[6/6/20, 10:38:37 AM] Joe: Yeaaah that’s true. I’m sure I’ll find something to do today
"
3698,"[6/6/20, 10:59:51 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ve heard of that movie. Never saw it though. What kind of phrases did you get from the movie?
"
3699,"[6/6/20, 11:06:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’ve resisted watching it ever since it came out
"
3700,"[6/6/20, 11:06:38 AM] Joe: But for you I’ll watch it 😂

"
3705,"[6/6/20, 11:27:40 AM] Joe: You wrote down so many phrases. I love it 😂
"
3706,"[6/6/20, 11:40:57 AM] Joe: Hahaha they seriously sounded good. The only one I notice anything is, “I’ll call you later.” Sounded like you said, “I call you later”.
"
3707,"[6/6/20, 11:43:22 AM] Joe: Yeah those are good ones haha it’s going to be so funny when we meet and only have some random phrases to communicate 😂
"
3708,"[6/6/20, 11:49:41 AM] Joe: If I lived in Madrid you would not be interested in me hahaha you love the distance
"
3709,"[6/6/20, 11:56:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha my bad 🤗
"
3710,"[6/6/20, 11:58:41 AM] Joe: I’m going to start my class for today now haha I’ll talk message you after 😘
"
3711,"[6/6/20, 12:00:24 PM] Joe: Wait...she didn’t answer 😞
"
3712,"[6/6/20, 12:00:52 PM] Joe: Alright. She’ll probably call back haha. Have fun exercising!
"
3713,"[6/6/20, 12:01:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks I’ll put it on 😂
"
3714,"[6/6/20, 12:02:46 PM] Joe: Good idea. Alright I’ll let you know how it goes
"
3715,"[6/6/20, 12:03:40 PM] Joe: 😘
"
3716,"[6/6/20, 12:17:46 PM] Joe: Movie is not available here 🤔 Probably because different regions have different things available. I’ll see if I can find it somewhere else

"
3720,"[6/6/20, 1:45:17 PM] Joe: Regional content is whack. I would just use a VPN but I watch Netflix on the smartTV with my sisters account haha So I can’t use one
"
3721,"[6/6/20, 1:48:20 PM] Joe: VPNs are useful sometimes haha. I have one that lets me change the country anytime. They don’t have servers in Spain but they do have servers in lots of countries nearby
"
3722,"[6/6/20, 1:56:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"

"
3727,"[6/7/20, 12:31:53 PM] Joe: Now if we could actually be in the same place instead of same environment that’d be great.
"
3728,"[6/7/20, 1:01:29 PM] Joe: Yeah the time will come before we know it. Feels like I just got here and already tomorrow is the day I leave. Time flew by
"
3729,"[6/7/20, 1:06:10 PM] Joe: Don’t you have work tomorrow? You ready to go?
"
3730,"[6/7/20, 1:26:45 PM] Joe: Sii 6 meses

"
3737,"[6/7/20, 1:30:55 PM] Joe: Sorry I thought I told you about them
"
3738,"[6/7/20, 1:34:17 PM] Joe: 11:30pm California time
"
3739,"[6/7/20, 1:35:01 PM] Joe: Yeah the schedule is a mess but it’s ok. I get paid to go to the meetings so can’t complain too much
"
3740,"[6/7/20, 1:36:06 PM] Joe: I don’t know. The camp might be cut down to shorter hours. Still 5 days a week though. We’ll see how it goes.
"
3741,"[6/7/20, 1:42:58 PM] Joe: Mmmm I feel like going back for some things but not for others haha. Yeah like my friends and family that are there. It will be nice to see them. 
"
3742,"[6/7/20, 1:43:31 PM] Joe: I’ll be looking forward to when I can get back to Hawaii. I’ll come back eventually. Need to do some more stuff first haha
"
3743,"[6/7/20, 1:48:04 PM] Joe: I could still skate here so it wasn’t a big deal. Lots of stuff I like skating near by.
"
3744,"[6/7/20, 1:48:54 PM] Joe: But I like the vibe out here in Hawaii compared to the Bay Area.  And less people haha
"
3745,"[6/7/20, 1:49:40 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I’ll make sure to go to you first

3902,"[6/11/20, 5:54:02 PM] Joe: It’s great. Took a while to get used to though. I was struggling at first haha. But I was getting back in the groove by the end. I almost got a cramp too so i know it was a good session 😂
"
3903,"[6/11/20, 6:00:14 PM] Joe: HahHah I hella want a dog that can skate 😂
"
3904,"[6/11/20, 6:00:53 PM] Joe: The most common one I see is a bulldog. The big ones not the tiny ones
"
3905,"[6/11/20, 6:04:29 PM] Joe: They drool a lot and like to bite things too haha not the best dog. But cool when they skate 🛹 🐕
"
3906,"[6/11/20, 6:09:18 PM] Joe: I had something like that in Hawaii. Or my sister did. It smelled like mint and had a cooling sensation when you put it on.
"
3907,"[6/11/20, 6:10:48 PM] Joe: Haha that stuff must smell super strong to wake you up when you put it on 😂
"
3908,"[6/11/20, 6:11:40 PM] Joe: It better work good. At least you found another use for it haha put it on in the morning and you won’t even need coffee

"
3910,"[6/11/20, 6:18:16 PM] Joe: I just got back from the skatepark about an hour ago. My legs are sore haha. I’m probably just going to rest for the rest of the night. Maybe I’ll go by my friends house later when he gets off work.

"
3938,"[6/12/20, 9:25:58 PM] Joe: I’m sorry 😞 I’m lame haha but it’s like how you didn’t want to message me back when it was the middle of the night here. Not that I don’t want to talk to you

4003,"[6/13/20, 11:23:35 AM] Joe: What’re you doing? I’m getting ready to go to a skate for black lives matter thing in Berkeley. A bunch of skaters are going to skate from the downtown area to the waterfront. Starts in an hour and a half
"

4014,"[6/13/20, 3:45:47 PM] Joe: He has a gold “grill” haha. It’s removable
"
4015,"[6/13/20, 3:46:54 PM] Joe: Yeah a lot of people living in the streets. That’s just one of the many camps around the city
"
4016,"[6/13/20, 3:52:44 PM] Joe: Yeah we ended at city hall and skated there for a while. I think the skate was about 6-7 miles so everyone was hella tired by the time we got to city hall
"
4017,"[6/13/20, 3:56:19 PM] Joe: Hahaha for real my legs feel like jello
"
4018,"[6/13/20, 4:03:17 PM] Joe: Yeah it was good. Now it’s time to eat. Going to go barbecue with my friends. Try and get some energy back haha.
"
4019,"[6/13/20, 4:06:32 PM] Joe: Ok sleep well. Talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘

4026,"[6/13/20, 9:57:33 PM] Joe: Haha no socks. I’m at my other friend Alex’s house.
"
4027,"[6/13/20, 9:58:06 PM] Joe: But his dogs are a little scared. They don’t like the fireworks
"
4028,"[6/13/20, 11:58:58 PM] Joe: Haha that’s ok. I don’t mind if you wait until the morning to respond to me. If you wake up in the night and check my message it’s totally chill if you wait to respond. I just wanted to send you videos. 
"
4029,"[6/14/20, 12:00:19 AM] Joe: I just got home 20 minutes ago but I’ll probably be falling asleep soon over here. Super tired and sore from a long day of skating.
"
4030,"[6/14/20, 12:05:11 AM] Joe: Ooooh boy haha. Still dreaming of that island life
"
4031,"[6/14/20, 12:07:44 AM] Joe: You’ll get back to the tropical life one day I’m sure haha
"
4032,"[6/14/20, 12:10:40 AM] Joe: Alriiiiight if you say so haha 🤷‍♂️ 
"
4033,"[6/14/20, 7:40:36 AM] Joe: Hahaha that always happens. I just got up a little while ago. I figured you were at work or something
"
4034,"[6/14/20, 7:43:38 AM] Joe: Absolutely nothing. I’m getting hungry but I’m being too lazy to get up haha
"
4035,"[6/14/20, 7:44:52 AM] Joe: Haha that sounds unpleasant
"
4036,"[6/14/20, 7:51:38 AM] Joe: Hahaha what the hell? That’s so weird 😂
"
4037,"[6/14/20, 7:52:09 AM] Joe: Now it sounds even more unpleasant than before. Good luck with that haha
"
4038,"[6/14/20, 7:57:51 AM] Joe: Hah they’re loud. You need some headphone or ear plugs 😂

4040,"[6/14/20, 8:02:27 AM] Joe: You definitely need that. Is everyone in the same spot all day or do you move around the event at all?

"
4045,"[6/14/20, 8:15:42 AM] Joe: And before you judge my shirt, my friend made it hahaha
"
4046,"[6/14/20, 8:19:43 AM] Joe: No this is another friend of mine. He makes clothes as a little side gig type of thing. He is the one I was trying to convince to use my e-commerce website I was building
"
4047,"[6/14/20, 8:20:21 AM] Joe: He is taking forever to give me all the things I need to complete it for him though
"
4048,"[6/14/20, 8:36:04 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s true. I need more projects in the portfolio for sure. Maybe I should work on that a little bit today.
"
4049,"[6/14/20, 8:38:23 AM] Joe: Damn tomorrow I start camp. Going to be a little strange with all the extra stuff we have to do. Hopefully since it’s only half days we can mostly skate outside and not have to worry too much.
"
4050,"[6/14/20, 8:39:56 AM] Joe: They had all kinds of rules for cleaning things before and after they get used, social distancing, when to wear mask and/or gloves
"
4051,"[6/14/20, 8:46:05 AM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
"
4052,"[6/14/20, 8:46:10 AM] Joe: haha sorry
"
4053,"[6/14/20, 8:46:17 AM] Joe: didn't mean to send that
"
4054,"[6/14/20, 8:47:06 AM] Joe: I think i only need gloves for when kids are getting to camp. I check them in and have to take their temperature and ask a bunch of questions every morning
"
4055,"[6/14/20, 8:48:06 AM] Joe: Yeah pretty much. We get everyone into groups by skill level and teach tricks and how to skate the park better in general
"
4056,"[6/14/20, 8:48:23 AM] Joe: how to utilize the ramps better and all that
"
4057,"[6/14/20, 8:49:14 AM] Joe: I'm on my computer and i accidentally hit send halfway through typing a sentence haha
"
4058,"[6/14/20, 8:53:22 AM] Joe: I think it's 7 to 14 year olds. And we get a maximum of 12.
"
4059,"[6/14/20, 8:55:27 AM] Joe: Of course hahaha i'm an fairly decent teacher of skateboarding i think 😂
"
4060,"[6/14/20, 9:11:08 AM] Joe: Hmmmm I like the older ones but we don’t get many
"
4061,"[6/14/20, 9:11:39 AM] Joe: We get more girls than we do boys between 10-14
"
4062,"[6/14/20, 9:13:53 AM] Joe: They’re just mellower and easier to deal with haha. If there is a little one that is super well behaved they’ll end up being my favorite haha.
"
4063,"[6/14/20, 9:14:25 AM] Joe: Oh god I hope not hahaha
"
4064,"[6/14/20, 9:18:59 AM] Joe: Haha good thing we don’t get too many teenage girls either. 1 or 2 maybe. Lots of younger girls though which is interesting. Parents signing them up for skate camp. They’re usually pretty cool though, more helpful and listen better than the boys haha
"
4065,"[6/14/20, 9:26:25 AM] Joe: The demographics are changing slowly in skateboarding. Lots of girls are skating now. It’s cool to see. Skateboarding is supposed to be for everyone so I like to see it expanding.
"
4066,"[6/14/20, 9:32:04 AM] Joe: Hahahaha

"
4069,"[6/14/20, 11:12:06 AM] Joe: I tried haha. Then I ate a little and didn’t have a coffee. Made me sleepy again
"
4070,"[6/14/20, 2:39:32 PM] Joe: haha you probably needed that after listening to those chicks all day
"
4071,"[6/14/20, 2:39:56 PM] Joe: I'm good, just messing with some of my old projects. Cleaning up the code a little bit
"
4072,"[6/14/20, 2:41:32 PM] Joe: Haha you love little Rogel. You always have him wrapped up like his Kangaroo mama hahaha
"
4073,"[6/14/20, 2:43:02 PM] Joe: Yeah i was surprised when you starting talking shit about them hahaha not a bad thing though. Can't be super sweet all the time haha
"
4074,"[6/14/20, 2:46:38 PM] Joe: Haha i can tell. You're very sweet with meeee 😂 But that's totally understandable. I really dislike superficiality
"
4075,"[6/14/20, 2:53:39 PM] Joe: Being sweet is all part of your scheme to get me to Spain haha
"
4076,"[6/14/20, 2:54:19 PM] Joe: I'm interested to see/hear you get mad or annoyed at me a little bit haha I reaaaaallly want to know what you get like when you're upset with me. I
"
4077,"[6/14/20, 2:54:32 PM] Joe: I'm sure i'll push your buttons enough to find out eventually haha
"
4078,"[6/14/20, 3:00:49 PM] Joe: haha i'm nervous 😂
"
4079,"[6/14/20, 3:01:43 PM] Joe: Alright haha for sure. I'm sure i can handle it regardless. I just want to be prepared haha
"
4080,"[6/14/20, 3:03:25 PM] Joe: Haha i don't expect you to be sweet all the time. I just want to know how to work with the type of person you are. If you're the type that needs space or needs to talk about it right away, it's good to know these things
"
4081,"[6/14/20, 3:04:36 PM] Joe: It sucks when someone doesn't understand how you deal with being angry. Usually that leads to even more anger and bigger fights haha.
"
4082,"[6/14/20, 3:06:03 PM] Joe: i just like to know what works and what doesn't haha.
"
4083,"[6/14/20, 3:06:26 PM] Joe: hahah ok so don't give too much room when you're mad...got it
"
4084,"[6/14/20, 3:10:13 PM] Joe: Ok ok i get that. Makes sense.
"
4085,"[6/14/20, 3:11:20 PM] Joe: Well....i want you to know that if you feel i'm not giving you enough of anything, attention or space, let me know. I agree that communication is key so be as open as you can and i'll try my best to do the same
"
4086,"[6/14/20, 3:17:30 PM] Joe: Noooo problem. I just want to know more about you haha. I'm super interested in what you're like day to day now since we've been talking for so long.
"
4087,"‎[6/14/20, 3:24:02 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted

4088,"[6/14/20, 3:24:24 PM] Joe: Soon I hope 🤞

4091,"[6/14/20, 3:29:22 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s all in the hands. I need to find more haha
"
4092,"[6/14/20, 3:34:36 PM] Joe: Aah what you got to ride horses? Siiiick
"
4093,"[6/14/20, 3:37:58 PM] Joe: Damn you have so many haha i can't find more. When i do i'll send them though. You win this round haha
"
4094,"[6/14/20, 3:45:13 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha. It's situational for me. If i'm only a little mad or annoyed, i'd like to talk about it. But if i get really upset, to the point i want to yell, i would rather just have space and not fight. Take time to breathe then come back and talk about it.
"
4095,"[6/14/20, 3:45:56 PM] Joe: It's really hard to upset me to the point of yelling. That's rare. But when it does happen space for a short time, with the understanding we'll try to talk about it later, is best for me.
"
4096,"[6/14/20, 3:47:49 PM] Joe: But most of the time I just try to bring up what i'm feeling if there are any problems before it gets to be too big of a deal and since you seem like you're willing to talk to me about things we should be good
"
4097,"[6/14/20, 3:53:20 PM] Joe: haha it's super rare. Not much upsets me to that point.
"
4098,"[6/14/20, 3:55:04 PM] Joe: Now i know what you mean about it being hard to describe haha
"
4099,"[6/14/20, 3:55:48 PM] Joe: But I don't want you to think i get super mad often cause i don't. I try to not let things bug me.
"
4100,"[6/14/20, 3:58:03 PM] Joe: What time do you have to get up tomorrow?

"
4128,"[6/15/20, 3:38:51 PM] Joe: Alright alright i'm going to stop giving you the play by play. You know how this movie goes haha.
"
4129,"[6/15/20, 3:46:32 PM] Joe: All romance type movies are a little corny so i can't judge too harshly. I'm enjoying it so far though
"
4130,"[6/15/20, 3:50:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I read this and look back at the screen and she is walking up to Noa 😂 major drama

4142,"[6/15/20, 4:52:52 PM] Joe: When she remembered and then after they dance she gets all mad. Hella sad dammit haha it was good though. Noa was a coooool dude

4144,"[6/15/20, 4:56:44 PM] Joe: Yeah my grandma on my moms side had something similar. She forgot everyone
"
4145,"[6/15/20, 4:57:09 PM] Joe: People definitely get easily upset when they're like that
"
4146,"[6/15/20, 4:57:22 PM] Joe: hahaha
"
4147,"[6/15/20, 4:58:13 PM] Joe: Oh the one cool thing about forgetting everything was, we tricked her into thinking she quit smoking hahaha
"
4148,"[6/15/20, 4:59:02 PM] Joe: One day she was going to go buy her pack of smokes and my aunt just told her, ""you don't smoke anymore, remember?"". Grandma said, ""oh i don't? Ok"" and never smoked again.
"
4149,"[6/15/20, 5:01:02 PM] Joe: When that happened she was in her 80s i think, and she had been smoking since a teenager haha. She passed away like 10 years ago but it's just an interesting example of how powerful those mental problems can be.
"
4150,"[6/15/20, 5:01:50 PM] Joe: But yeah, in the movie, super said that moment when she remembers haha
"
4151,"[6/15/20, 5:02:02 PM] Joe: sad* not said
"
4152,"[6/15/20, 5:02:43 PM] Joe: That was a rollercoaster of drama haha
"
4153,"[6/15/20, 5:17:33 PM] Joe: Hahaha you’ll see my sad face one day
"
4154,"[6/15/20, 7:02:10 PM] Joe: Nooo worries
"
4155,"[6/15/20, 7:03:15 PM] Joe: Haha I just thought it was a good story. Beautiful. Both happy and sad. Like real life. It’s complicated.
"
4156,"[6/15/20, 7:03:36 PM] Joe: Ok we can talk about it more later though 😘

"
4160,"[6/16/20, 6:21:09 AM] Joe: Haha you’re so sweet. That’s cool I was just thinking about how I can get my own started relatively soon
"
4161,"[6/16/20, 6:28:10 AM] Joe: Oh nice good timing
"
4162,"[6/16/20, 6:29:04 AM] Joe: Yeah doesn’t seem too difficult at all. I need to get some land haha
"
4163,"[6/16/20, 6:29:40 AM] Joe: I enjoyed the movie a lot. I was very into it haha
"
4164,"[6/16/20, 6:36:15 AM] Joe: Nah it wasn’t too corny haha. I liked it. The story was beautifully sad haha good movie
"
4165,"[6/16/20, 7:01:20 AM] Joe: Work is going well. First day went smooth besides one kid having a mini meltdown and not wanting to do anything but he’s not in my group haha. I have to go to work in about 30-45 minutes
"
4166,"[6/16/20, 7:25:11 AM] Joe: Thanks babe 😘

"
4170,"[6/16/20, 12:35:27 PM] Joe: So normally I work a very short day. 8:30am until 12:30. But sometimes I’ll pick up extra hours monitoring the park or giving private lessons. On those days I’m not sure what time I’ll get off. Depends on the day
"
4171,"[6/16/20, 12:39:12 PM] Joe: Hahaha we have a limit on how many people can enter so I’m sitting by the entrance keeping track and letting people in
"
4172,"[6/16/20, 12:41:49 PM] Joe: It’s open to the public now. Camp ended at noon(40 minutes ago)
"
4173,"[6/16/20, 12:42:53 PM] Joe: It’s cool though. I just hang out here and skate once in while to pass the time. Should go by quick. I like getting paid to be at the skatepark anyway. Best job 😂
"
4174,"[6/16/20, 12:49:55 PM] Joe: Hahah someone said I looked hella young for 30 yesterday. They didn’t believe my age when I told them. It was pretty funny.

4176,"[6/16/20, 2:33:47 PM] Joe: I’m bored haha. I skated for a while and now my legs are getting sore.
"
4177,"[6/16/20, 2:34:09 PM] Joe: Only 2 1/2 hours to go though. Not bad
"
4178,"[6/16/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha true! I’ve been skating too much since I got back and not enough when I was in Hawaii. Have to build the strength back up.
"
4179,"[6/16/20, 2:49:18 PM] Joe: How are youuu? What’re you doing?
"
4180,"[6/16/20, 3:07:48 PM] Joe: Yeah it was great haha
"
4181,"[6/17/20, 1:07:17 AM] Joe: Buenos días. I want our old schedules back. I’m getting ready to go to bed soon but I wanted to say hello first haha
"
4182,"[6/17/20, 1:19:02 AM] Joe: Oh last thing before I fall asleep...I don’t think I sent you this before. What this dude built is really cool to me. It has subtitles you can turn on. 
"

4184,"[6/17/20, 1:29:44 AM] Joe: Thank you for the video haha you’re cute. I’ll try to send videos of myself to you soon. Have to stay in touch however I can at this point 😂
"
4185,"[6/17/20, 1:30:43 AM] Joe: I have to get up early though so I should get to sleep. I’ll talk to you soon though
"
4186,"[6/17/20, 1:31:38 AM] Joe: Whisissidi dammit hahaha I want to be with you 😭
"
4187,"[6/17/20, 1:32:18 AM] Joe: That’s ok. I love videos from you so much. They always make me smile. You’re the best

"
4189,"[6/17/20, 1:36:16 AM] Joe: Oh for sure I agee. I really want to work something out to make sure we keep talking.
"
4190,"[6/17/20, 1:36:40 AM] Joe: And I don’t want you to feel like I’m not giving you attention or something like that.
"
4191,"[6/17/20, 1:37:37 AM] Joe: That’s why I wanted to say something to you before I went to bed. I really want to talk to you all the time but it’s just been difficult lately.
"
4192,"[6/17/20, 1:42:22 AM] Joe: Haha Jealous of these cats. Thank you. Alright have a good morning ☀️

4197,"[6/17/20, 11:38:54 AM] Joe: Damn I thought I was tan when I was in Hawaii but I’m getting hella darker being at the skatepark haha. Another chaotic day of camp almost over 😀
"
4198,"[6/17/20, 12:15:01 PM] Joe: No monitoring for me today. I’m heading home now. My board hit me in my arm and face hahaha now my arm hurts and i have a little bump on my chin 😂
"

4200,"[6/17/20, 1:19:09 PM] Joe: Get back home safe. Happy birthday to your brother 🥳 🎊
"
4201,"[6/17/20, 1:19:36 PM] Joe: 😂
"
4202,"[6/17/20, 1:19:46 PM] Joe: You need to wear some stretchy pants next time
"
4203,"[6/17/20, 1:23:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got him to shed a tear. Didn’t even have to make him watch The Notebook first haha.
"
4204,"[6/17/20, 1:24:00 PM] Joe: That’s sweet though. Videos like that are great, looking back at all the memories and stuff
"
4205,"[6/17/20, 1:32:35 PM] Joe: hahah what was with the music? Looks like a good time
"
4206,"[6/17/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: Sounds good. How did you like it?
"
4207,"[6/17/20, 1:34:49 PM] Joe: Ooooh, yeah i was confused when the Christmas music came on  haha
"
4208,"[6/17/20, 1:38:37 PM] Joe: That makes sense. Have the fancier stuff when you go out. You can make the classic stuff at home haha
"
4209,"[6/17/20, 1:39:39 PM] Joe: Hella cute
"
4210,"[6/17/20, 1:40:47 PM] Joe: Hmmm I'm not a huge fan of sushi but i still eat it haha
"
4211,"[6/17/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I don't know what i like. Just good tasting food haha. Most things grilled on a barbecue is delicious to me. Lots of meat dishes.
"
4212,"[6/17/20, 1:43:03 PM] Joe: My favorite dish is probably lomo saltado
"
4213,"[6/17/20, 1:43:17 PM] Joe: hella good mmmmm i want some now
"
4214,"[6/17/20, 1:45:33 PM] Joe: Oh i love to eat a good bowl of pho. We have some really good Vietnamese food places around here. Ah there is too much stuff i like. Some i don't like but i'll give most things a try
"
4215,"[6/17/20, 1:45:49 PM] Joe: Yes it's a Peruvian dish
"
4216,"[6/17/20, 1:49:54 PM] Joe: The bay area is a really good place for trying different kinds of food. You can find food from any culture relatively easy around here with a short drive. There are quite a few Vietnamese places around me. It's super good. Especially if you want some hot soup
"
4217,"[6/17/20, 1:49:56 PM] Joe: mmmm
"
4218,"[6/17/20, 1:52:12 PM] Joe: Oh and food from a good taco truck is always smackin haha
"
4219,"[6/17/20, 1:52:59 PM] Joe: I can't believe you've never had Pho
"
4220,"[6/17/20, 2:01:31 PM] Joe: Damn I sure hope so!
"
4221,"‎[6/17/20, 2:02:53 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
4222,"[6/17/20, 2:09:11 PM] Joe: Yeah that's true. It can definitely change your perspective on life
"
4223,"[6/17/20, 2:12:31 PM] Joe: I have friends that have gone on trips to the Philippines and Vietnam and they enjoyed the time there. I need to go
"
4224,"[6/17/20, 2:17:44 PM] Joe: Hahah that would be siiiiick. If only we were free now. We'll get there eventually haha
"
4225,"[6/17/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: Haha I only call her on the weekends officially now. Sometimes I call during the week but I get busy so I don’t want her waiting for me when my schedule changes.
"
4226,"[6/17/20, 2:21:25 PM] Joe: I’m still learning haha I’m sure you’ll get a little English figured out too so we’ll be fiiine 😂
"
4227,"[6/17/20, 2:45:32 PM] Joe: I’m still so terrible at stringing together a sentence so a lot of it is me listening to her speak Spanish to me. But I try to speak Spanish when I can figure out a sentence or two
"
4228,"[6/17/20, 2:47:21 PM] Joe: When you send me audio clips too. I just listen over and over and try to hear what you’re saying really well. I don’t know. I’m trying though. I still have my notebook which I forgot at work today because I was trying to look at it when I had time haha
"
4229,"[6/17/20, 2:48:38 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I did get my one sentence in this morning haha. It’s difficult to remind myself to practice but I try
"
4230,"[6/17/20, 2:49:35 PM] Joe: They’d be so confused. My notes are all over the place. I also have my sketches for websites and notes for programming.
"
4231,"[6/17/20, 2:49:49 PM] Joe: A bunch of nonsense in that notebook to whoever finds it haha
"
4232,"[6/17/20, 2:51:11 PM] Joe: My spanish will be limited to one liners that resemble the structure of a meme 😂
"
4233,"[6/17/20, 2:52:08 PM] Joe: Hahah nah I’ll get better though. My vocabulary is just super limited still. I haven’t been studying vocabulary enough
"
4234,"[6/17/20, 2:54:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha wow that’s a lot of stuff we sent to each other 😂
"
4235,"[6/17/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s hard. You always say things in different ways
"
4236,"[6/17/20, 2:58:58 PM] Joe: The only thing you say often is that you’re sorry you fell asleep haha other than that you vary your sentences quite a bit so you might say something similar but it isn’t the same phrase
"
4237,"[6/17/20, 3:00:16 PM] Joe: Unlike me hahah I’ll say the same exact thing over and over 😂
"
4238,"[6/17/20, 3:01:24 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s the one. You’re most used phrase by far haha
"
4239,"[6/17/20, 3:01:37 PM] Joe: Your*
"
4240,"[6/17/20, 3:03:19 PM] Joe: Haha siii
"
4241,"[6/17/20, 3:04:10 PM] Joe: Yeah now I got up too late. My body is still in Hawaii time. 8am feels like 5am to me.
"
4242,"[6/17/20, 3:07:32 PM] Joe: It does haha
"
4243,"[6/17/20, 3:08:11 PM] Joe: Wait I missed this thing. So what class are you going to take?
"
4244,"[6/17/20, 3:17:08 PM] Joe: Thanks. I appreciate that. That was a lot to type out haha
"
4245,"[6/17/20, 3:18:53 PM] Joe: Eh actually I wasn’t far off from listening to you. There is sooo much I didn’t hear correctly or comprehend but got enough that I was “in the ballpark”
"
4246,"[6/17/20, 3:21:07 PM] Joe: When you say things like “que ir a clase” the words all blend together haha. Like “tener quira clase”
"
4247,"[6/17/20, 3:22:46 PM] Joe: I wasn’t very confident though haha and like I said I missed a lot of it. when I translated i realized I had the basic idea of what you were saying but I missed the specifics
"
4248,"[6/17/20, 3:24:28 PM] Joe: Yeah whenever you start to speed up you lose me a little but it’s ok. It’s good to hear what someone really sounds like when they say these things. The same blending of words happens often when people speak English too
"
4249,"[6/17/20, 3:25:52 PM] Joe: Haha sometimes you say “nada” and my brain totally gets stuck on how it is connected to what you are saying 😂
"
4250,"[6/17/20, 3:26:43 PM] Joe: Like I think you said “nada” at the beginning of an audio clip one time and it confused the crap out of me because it changed the context of what you were saying when I translated it in my head haha
"
4251,"[6/17/20, 3:29:47 PM] Joe: Haha that’s strange. I guess I need to speak “proper English” so you can understand me 😂
"
4252,"[6/17/20, 3:33:52 PM] Joe: Haha damn I still haven’t shown a video of you to my friends. I want to now. I need to get there reactions.
"
4253,"[6/17/20, 3:36:12 PM] Joe: But they’ve probably all lurked on your Instagram already I bet cause everyone is so nosy haha

4256,"[6/17/20, 3:45:05 PM] Joe: Busted haha
"
4257,"[6/17/20, 3:50:45 PM] Joe: He is 2 years younger than me
"
4258,"[6/17/20, 3:54:48 PM] Joe: Haha that’s true. It would be a good time. Got to get you to the US though. It’s in Eugene, Oregon
"
4259,"[6/17/20, 3:59:15 PM] Joe: Hahah fuck that guy. I'll get you here
"
4260,"[6/17/20, 3:59:25 PM] Joe: med
"
4261,"[6/17/20, 3:59:43 PM] Joe: hahah that last one was an accident. Ignore that
"
4262,"[6/17/20, 4:05:07 PM] Joe: Hahah one of the little kids at skate camp said he likes Andrew Yang 😂
"
4263,"[6/17/20, 4:07:20 PM] Joe: He's cool. His name is Marco Joseph haha my middle name is Marco. So i'm Joseph Marco. And he is Peruvian. He doesn't like skating that much though so that's points off for him.
"
4264,"[6/17/20, 4:08:12 PM] Joe: Alright i'll talk to you later. Sleep well! Buenas noches 😘
"
4265,"[6/17/20, 4:10:25 PM] Joe: He comes every year with his friend
"
4266,"[6/17/20, 4:12:34 PM] Joe: Buenas nochesss

4284,"[6/18/20, 2:54:10 PM] Joe: It’s from when I hit my arm and chin with my skateboard the other day. I don’t why the bruise got so bad out of nowhere 🤷‍♂️
"
4285,"[6/18/20, 3:27:01 PM] Joe: Yeah it got me good. But good news is i supposedly won a micro-grant from this foundation that Andrew Yang started. It's only $250 but i'll take it hahaha
"
4286,"[6/18/20, 3:27:34 PM] Joe: We'll see if it's for real in 3-5 business days 😂

"
4290,"[6/18/20, 10:58:40 PM] Joe: It’s only a one time thing haha
"
4291,"[6/18/20, 10:59:46 PM] Joe: Anyone in the US can get it. You just have to sign up for it and hope they pick you eventually
"
4292,"[6/18/20, 11:00:14 PM] Joe: Hahahah

4293,"[6/18/20, 11:00:28 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll do that 😂

"
4437,"[6/22/20, 1:17:56 PM] Joe: I got my appointment to apply for my passport tomorrow. I think normally it takes 6-8 weeks but it’s supposed to take longer right now 😞
"
4438,"[6/22/20, 1:31:20 PM] Joe: Haha damn I wish it was that fast here. I don’t have a photo but I can pay $15 to get one taken at my appointment. I need to fill out some paperwork and make a photocopy of some paperwork though

"
4442,"[6/22/20, 1:52:28 PM] Joe: They'll probably charge some other fees too. Who knows. So far it's $50 total. We'll find out tomorrow if i have to spend more than that for the actual passport itself. Cause the receipt said i paid for ""passport services"" which makes me think i only paid for the appointment
"
4443,"[6/22/20, 1:54:28 PM] Joe: Hopefully it's only 50 total. I'm looking online and supposedly i have to pay more for the booklet or whatever
"
4444,"[6/22/20, 1:54:39 PM] Joe: We'll see
"
4445,"[6/22/20, 1:54:54 PM] Joe: At least i got that money from Andrew Yang to pay for it hahaha
"
4446,"[6/22/20, 2:04:30 PM] Joe: Hahah siii muchooo tiempo

"
4451,"[6/22/20, 2:07:45 PM] Joe: Yes I believe it will be before you are 32. How long can it really be delayed??
"
4452,"[6/22/20, 2:08:32 PM] Joe: Hopefully only a few weeks extra. I’ll have to buy an expensive ticket when I finally get the passport so I can come right away though hahaha

"
4459,"[6/22/20, 2:22:28 PM] Joe: I’m really looking forward to seeing you. It sucks that it’ll take so long but we’ll get there eventually.
"
4460,"[6/22/20, 2:23:47 PM] Joe: I have a lot to figure out though too. How long do I go for? Will I stay with you? What if you end up hating me? Do I go back to the US after?
"
4461,"[6/22/20, 2:24:30 PM] Joe: There is a lot of complications with international travel
"
4462,"[6/22/20, 2:24:46 PM] Joe: Whatever, I’ll figure it out eventually haha

4487,"[6/22/20, 2:52:54 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I believe that one
"
4488,"[6/22/20, 2:53:08 PM] Joe: It’ll be an interesting moment for sure haha
"
4489,"[6/22/20, 2:57:28 PM] Joe: Haha yeah but I think I’m only allowed to go for 90 days unless I apply for something specific. Or even if I want to work there or whatever. It’s all different stuff I have to do. I don’t know it’s complicated.
"
4490,"[6/22/20, 2:58:59 PM] Joe: But what I do depends a lot on what you want. When I buy my ticket I’ll need to know what I should be planning for I guess. Haha I don’t know it’s hard to explain. I don’t need all the details but a general idea of what you want would be nice.
"
4491,"[6/22/20, 2:59:14 PM] Joe: I don’t want to come barging into your life in a way you didn’t want
"
4492,"[6/22/20, 3:04:54 PM] Joe: Haha we'll figure it all out later i guess. Got to get my passport first.
"
4493,"[6/22/20, 3:05:47 PM] Joe: I doubt i'll get bored with you though, especially after only 3 months. It will be hard to leave you i'm sure 🥺

"
4497,"[6/22/20, 4:37:19 PM] Joe: Today was super short. Only 4 hours. It was a good day though. Less kids came this week so only 10 total now.
"
4498,"[6/22/20, 4:37:44 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I got to skate a little bit yesterday. Not as much as I would’ve liked to

"
4515,"[6/23/20, 12:23:19 PM] Joe: I hurt my leg hahaha
"
4516,"[6/23/20, 12:24:00 PM] Joe: Just a little bit. It feels sore. I’m just getting home now. I have to print out some papers and then go to that appointment
"
4517,"[6/23/20, 12:30:54 PM] Joe: Siiick. That place looks fun to skate. Is it the same plaza you sent a video of the other day?
"
4518,"[6/23/20, 12:31:13 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
4519,"[6/23/20, 12:34:35 PM] Joe: I was trying to grind a ledge but I missed it with my skateboard and hit my leg on the ledge pretty hard. It’s not too bad. Just really sore

"
4527,"[6/23/20, 1:06:44 PM] Joe: Tied. It’s all messed up from being in a helmet all day so tied is the only option haha

"
4551,"[6/23/20, 3:43:40 PM] Joe: Oh haha just girls
"
4552,"[6/23/20, 3:45:19 PM] Joe: What about youuu? Do you also like girls or just boys?
"
4553,"[6/23/20, 3:46:02 PM] Joe: Haha ok. Interesting questions 😂 😂
"
4554,"[6/23/20, 3:46:10 PM] Joe: Hahahah

4561,"[6/23/20, 3:55:00 PM] Joe: Haha this makes me wonder if I gave you a reason to think that I would like guys in the first place
"
4562,"[6/23/20, 3:55:41 PM] Joe: It’s not my preferred situation but it wouldn’t be a deal breaker i guess
"
4563,"[6/23/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: As long as you like me at the moment, I don’t see why I should care if you like girls too 🤷‍♂️
"
4564,"[6/23/20, 3:58:28 PM] Joe: i’m not into like open relationships or whatever either. So if I like you, you’re the one person I like in that way.
"
4565,"[6/23/20, 4:00:48 PM] Joe: Haha ok I was also going to ask if you’ve been in that situation before or something.
"
4566,"[6/23/20, 4:01:27 PM] Joe: It’s fine though, I’m not bisexual so you won’t have that problem with me
"
4567,"[6/23/20, 4:03:27 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I’ll tell them about it someday

"
4571,"[6/23/20, 4:13:06 PM] Joe: Cause I’m coming haha

"
4579,"[6/23/20, 11:44:45 PM] Joe: I forgot to tell you that some kid smacked his chin on the ground today at camp 😬 luckily he didn’t knock out any teeth or anything like that. He just had a cut and bump on his chin. I always forget about the injuries that happen at skate camp

"
4582,"[6/24/20, 12:05:49 AM] Joe: It wasn’t bad enough to need to go to the hospital or anything but hitting your chin on the ground always sucks. His dad came and picked him up early. He definitely took a solid hit
"
4583,"[6/24/20, 12:12:19 AM] Joe: Hmm I guess I hate when I sprain my ankle the most haha.
"
4584,"[6/24/20, 12:14:15 AM] Joe: I’ve done it so many times now. It sucks. I also hate getting hit in the shin. That sucks and is super common.
"
4585,"[6/24/20, 12:18:24 AM] Joe: Recording what? Skateboard videos?
"
4586,"[6/24/20, 12:18:56 AM] Joe: Haha shiiiit

"
4604,"[6/24/20, 12:35:20 PM] Joe: Our public transportation is so trash haha. It would take me forever to get home if I didn’t drive.
"
4605,"[6/24/20, 12:39:30 PM] Joe: 30 minutes driving but probably 1 or 2 hours with public transportation. Either a train and bus or two busses
"
4606,"[6/24/20, 12:47:54 PM] Joe: Haha yeah same. I was really enjoying life without a car in Hawaii. Everything I needed was close enough I could just skate everywhere
"
4607,"[6/24/20, 12:56:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha sounds like a plan
"
4608,"[6/24/20, 12:56:38 PM] Joe: Is it more typical to use public transportation than to drive your own car around where you live?
"
4609,"[6/24/20, 1:05:07 PM] Joe: Hahah romancitoooo https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDcxNTI1MzExMDEzNjA5?igshid=l79aoy7fh4k7&story_media_id=2214225930074223088

4616,"[6/24/20, 1:35:41 PM] Joe: Also, that car looks like it was in pretty good shape for as old as it is. We don’t have Renaults here

4659,"[6/26/20, 8:01:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah hopefully today goes a little smoother and the kids aren’t being such little jerks haha. Alright babe I’ll talk to you soon! 😘

4660,"[6/26/20, 12:46:32 PM] Joe: Hahah me toooo!

4663,"[6/26/20, 12:49:40 PM] Joe: What happened???
"
4664,"[6/26/20, 12:50:44 PM] Joe: Ooooooh haha do you get a commission?
"
4665,"[6/26/20, 12:51:03 PM] Joe: That’s funny. You must’ve done a really good job 😂
"
4666,"[6/26/20, 12:53:07 PM] Joe: Hahahah so he just thought you were cute or something? Haha that’s funny

"
4670,"[6/26/20, 12:59:48 PM] Joe: But at least he came back to buy stuff haha
"
4671,"[6/26/20, 1:00:51 PM] Joe: No one ever comes to the skatepark looking nice for me haha Mostly a bunch of smelly dudes when it’s not time for camp hahaha

"
4674,"[6/26/20, 1:13:28 PM] Joe: I always think about how I barely said anything when you first messaged me hahaha. Oblivious
"
4675,"[6/26/20, 1:14:27 PM] Joe: Only a little bit longer and you’ll get what you want. I promise

4679,"[6/26/20, 3:34:52 PM] Joe: Haha socks just ignores the snoring. She’s chill. I want to take socks for myself sometimes 😂
"
4680,"[6/26/20, 4:17:41 PM] Joe: I think we just might have to. I’ll tell Kyle that his dog is now ours

"
4684,"[6/26/20, 11:59:55 PM] Joe: Oh haha that’s a little better I guess.
"
4685,"[6/27/20, 12:02:54 AM] Joe: This is hella random but my friend is letting me learn to drive stick with his car so I can drift it too haha. I’m pretty excited to try drifting
"

"
4687,"[6/27/20, 12:07:03 AM] Joe: It’s a stick shift. I’ve only driven auto. My first time driving a manual transmission was a few days ago when he let me drive that car haha
"
4688,"[6/27/20, 12:08:29 AM] Joe: I figured it out quick. I learned already how to drive a stick shift in a video game and it was about the same. But next I have to learn how to slide the car. That’s going to be hella fun. He keeps trying to convince me to buy my own drift car but I don’t want to haha
"
4689,"[6/27/20, 12:13:29 AM] Joe: Haha yeah his car has a manual gearshift
"
4690,"[6/27/20, 12:14:25 AM] Joe: Every car I’ve had has been automatic
"
4691,"[6/27/20, 12:15:01 AM] Joe: Good thing I learned now haha
"
4692,"[6/27/20, 12:15:18 AM] Joe: There is probably a lot of good drift cars near you then
"
4693,"[6/27/20, 12:16:14 AM] Joe: Hahaha damn now I want to get my drifting down before i meet you.
"
4694,"[6/27/20, 12:16:45 AM] Joe: So I can scare the shit out of you by sliding the car around

"
4697,"[6/27/20, 12:35:09 AM] Joe: Yeah that place looks really nice. I like the patio.
"
4698,"[6/27/20, 12:36:14 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ll have to add that to my notebook. But yeah it’s a controlled skid. Well....hopefully it’s controlled 😂
"
4699,"[6/27/20, 12:38:17 AM] Joe: Damn that’s hella sick. It’s like in the city too? Not just outside the city or something?
"
4700,"[6/27/20, 12:45:16 AM] Joe: Yeah it’s a suburban area so lots of houses. It’s an ok little neighborhood, not the best haha but not the worst either
"
4701,"[6/27/20, 1:11:39 AM] Joe: I believe it’s like $1800, maybe a little more, for their 2 bedroom 1 bathroom. They live in one half of a duplex.
"
4702,"[6/27/20, 1:13:46 AM] Joe: No not at all. Like i said it’s not the best neighborhood, it can be a little sketchy in that area. But the block he lives on is chill
"
4703,"[6/27/20, 1:15:00 AM] Joe: The architecture near you is way cooler than what’s around here haha
"
4704,"[6/27/20, 1:15:24 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m getting tired. I’ll probably fall asleep really soon

"
4707,"[6/27/20, 8:35:10 AM] Joe: Hahah ok ok. Did you ever find the that bud you lost the other day?
"
4708,"[6/27/20, 8:35:49 AM] Joe: Hahaha niiiiiice
"
4709,"[6/27/20, 8:47:07 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s true, it’ll be a nice surprise. I love when I randomly find stuff that I misplaced
"
4710,"[6/27/20, 9:12:40 AM] Joe: So rare that it’s money for me. It’s usually just a receipt or something useless in my pockets hahaha

"
4714,"[6/27/20, 9:47:26 AM] Joe: It’s been a long time since I’ve been in snow haha. Shit. I’m going to need warmer clothes 😂
"
4715,"[6/27/20, 9:51:43 AM] Joe: Haha dude 2 degrees is hella cold. That’s like 35F. It’s 60F now and I’m already cold 😂
"
4716,"[6/27/20, 9:52:25 AM] Joe: No I haven’t snowboarded before. I really want to try it. Looks fun
"
4717,"[6/27/20, 9:52:47 AM] Joe: Have you snowboarded before?
"
4718,"[6/27/20, 10:16:21 AM] Joe: FUCK!
"
4719,"[6/27/20, 10:16:56 AM] Joe: Can I at least get to you first? That would be nice. Then they can start another quarantine but this time we can be together hahaha

4721,"[6/27/20, 10:21:54 AM] Joe: Why is this happening???? I just want to see you. One person. Is that so much to ask for?
"
4722,"[6/27/20, 10:22:01 AM] Joe: The world is against me here hahaha fuck
"
4723,"[6/27/20, 10:23:15 AM] Joe: So now if I can’t get to you before the end of the year I need more shit?? I better figure out how to get to you as soon as possible haha. What a shitty situation
"
4724,"[6/27/20, 10:39:26 AM] Joe: I feel like I’m going to go for sure. I’ve actually been getting nervous cause my spanish is still trash 😂
"
4725,"[6/27/20, 10:40:36 AM] Joe: But also excited cause it will be a really different experience for me and I’ll learn a lot while also being around you haha
"
4726,"[6/27/20, 10:53:34 AM] Joe: Hahaha our first video call will be a bunch of “uuuuuuh mmmmm hmmmm” 😂 I really don’t mind the challenge. Even if I don’t understand a single word you say I’ll still enjoy our call I’m sure.
"
4727,"[6/27/20, 10:54:29 AM] Joe: But yeah, one step at a time. Have to get that passport. My excitement is building as the days go by. It feels like we’re getting close haha
"
4728,"[6/27/20, 2:56:42 PM] Joe: No worries. I’m working on the “drift car” again haha.
"
4729,"[6/27/20, 2:59:40 PM] Joe: How much were flights? Super expensive? I haven’t been looking. Just saving my money. I already know I’m going to have to spend a lot for a ticket most likely
"
4730,"[6/27/20, 3:03:34 PM] Joe: Just let me know when you’re ready for a video chat and we can make it happen hahah
"
4731,"[6/27/20, 3:08:34 PM] Joe: I won’t tell you the cost lol I
"
4732,"[6/27/20, 3:08:39 PM] Joe: 😂
"
4733,"[6/27/20, 3:09:08 PM] Joe: You found good deals. You need to come see me instead hahah
"
4734,"[6/27/20, 3:09:48 PM] Joe: Or when it’s time for me to get a ticket you can find me a good deal too. That would work
"
4735,"[6/27/20, 3:12:18 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
4736,"[6/27/20, 3:14:23 PM] Joe: Niiiice not bad at all. They better let me go see you haha
"
4737,"[6/27/20, 3:15:07 PM] Joe: I was thinking that it might be a good idea for me to have a drink or two before I chat with you 😂 we can drink beers together over a video chat hahaha

"
4739,"[6/27/20, 3:32:09 PM] Joe: Hahah I understand. We’ve already talked plenty through messages anyway and I feel like I’ve gotten to know you a lot. I’m definitely more interested in what it’s like to actually be with you in person
"
4740,"[6/28/20, 8:24:24 AM] Joe: Holaaaa
"
4741,"[6/28/20, 8:27:03 AM] Joe: Damn 3 months already?? It goes by fast. 
"
4742,"[6/28/20, 8:34:56 AM] Joe: Hahah niiiice
"
4743,"[6/28/20, 8:35:21 AM] Joe: Let me join you 😂
"
4744,"[6/28/20, 8:39:15 AM] Joe: That’s so wild. I never imagined talking to you for so long or planning to see you when you first messaged me. But I’m happy about it now. We only missed like 1 day talking to each other in all that time haha. Not bad.
"
4745,"[6/28/20, 9:40:59 AM] Joe: Junk food and beer 😋
"
4746,"[6/28/20, 9:44:19 AM] Joe: I would love to join you for a movie. We would probably get “distracted” or fall asleep before the end of the movie 😂
"
4747,"[6/28/20, 9:44:24 AM] Joe: But I’d enjoy that

"

"
4753,"[6/28/20, 11:06:23 AM] Joe: I noticed your meals are usually pretty small. I can’t lie, I eat a lot sometimes hahaha but it all gets burned off from skating so it’s cool
"
4754,"[6/28/20, 11:11:21 AM] Joe: Haha 🤷‍♂️ that’s what it looks like when you send videos or pictures of your meals to me.
"
4755,"[6/28/20, 11:12:05 AM] Joe: But good to know it’s not what it seems like haha
"
4756,"[6/28/20, 11:12:11 AM] Joe: I love food
"
4757,"[6/28/20, 11:13:42 AM] Joe: Yeah I eat a lot. Especially when I’m doing a lot of skating. 
"
4758,"[6/28/20, 11:32:33 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s hella cute. I need to teach my dog cool tricks when I get one 🐕

"
4761,"[6/28/20, 11:41:28 AM] Joe: But honestly I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it too much. I’ll know when I see the dog haha
"
4762,"[6/28/20, 11:42:29 AM] Joe: Hahaha 🙈
"
4763,"[6/28/20, 12:12:10 PM] Joe: Hmmm I like medium sized short hair dogs. Interesting coloration of the fur is cool to me. I’ll have to pay more attention to what makes me like dogs when I see them.
"
4764,"[6/28/20, 12:13:35 PM] Joe: I do like long tail instead of the little stump tail. And funny ears too. I was having too much fun playing with Sock’a ears cause one is floppy and the other stands up straight
"
4765,"[6/28/20, 12:15:55 PM] Joe: I like an affectionate dog but not to the point where they get overly needy for attention. A nice balance haha
"
4766,"[6/28/20, 12:58:10 PM] Joe: Haha that’s why I like short hair. So they can be close to me without shedding too much everywhere.
"
4767,"[6/28/20, 12:59:56 PM] Joe: Haha whoops

4770,"[6/29/20, 7:38:38 AM] Joe: Holaaaaa! I’m leaving to camp in a little bit and I have an interview for a temporary position doing some programming work later. Hopefully I get the coding job, it pays really good! Wish me luck haha

"
4773,"[6/29/20, 7:47:40 AM] Joe: It looks so nice out there. Also, there’s a lot of parks around the city it seems like
"
4774,"[6/29/20, 7:48:01 AM] Joe: 🍅
"
4775,"[6/29/20, 7:53:23 AM] Joe: I can work from a distance. “Remote work” or whatever.
"
4776,"[6/29/20, 7:53:40 AM] Joe: Haha true. Thanks for the advice.
"
4777,"[6/29/20, 7:54:24 AM] Joe: Oh I can’t wait to see the pictures after you get back 😂 🍅
"
4778,"[6/29/20, 7:55:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m confident in my ability to learn the technology for the project. It’s similar to what I’ve worked with before.
"
4779,"[6/29/20, 7:56:12 AM] Joe: Oh I forgot to tell you how i got it. I actually know the guy from a class I took a few years ago. He messaged me on LinkedIn about the position
"
4780,"[6/29/20, 7:59:48 AM] Joe: Haha be careful in the sun. You’re going to get toasted 😂
"
4781,"[6/29/20, 8:02:11 AM] Joe: I’m pretty confident about this one since he approached me and he knows me from a class but we’ll see 🤷‍♂️
"
4782,"[6/29/20, 8:02:20 AM] Joe: 😂 😂
"
4783,"[6/29/20, 8:05:05 AM] Joe: Around 1
"
4784,"[6/29/20, 8:05:52 AM] Joe: I’m going to work now so I’ll be driving. Barely going to make it on time haha. I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
"
4785,"[6/29/20, 11:48:55 AM] Joe: I’m almost free haha. I’m so tired and hungry. I’m going to eat, talk to the guy about the job, and probably take a nap. I had zero energy today for some reason
"
4786,"[6/29/20, 1:45:27 PM] Joe: It went pretty good! He said he will email me later with more details. But it sounds like a cool gig. $1500/week to code 1-2 features every 2 weeks. All remote work so I can work from anywhere. I hope this works out. It would be perfect
"
4787,"[6/29/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: $1500 every week. So $6000/month. But that’s before taxes. And doing the math it’s about $78,000/year which isn’t great for software developers but I’ll take it haha. Something to pad the resume with so I can get the big money later. Writing code pays really well, it’s just hard to find work sometimes.
"
4788,"[6/29/20, 2:22:59 PM] Joe: We’ll see what happens. Hopefully it works out. I still have to learn some new technologies I haven’t worked with. Ooooh I’m excited haha
"
4789,"[6/29/20, 3:12:46 PM] Joe: Thank you thank you! 😊
"
4790,"[6/29/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I was eating
"
4791,"[6/29/20, 3:18:09 PM] Joe: He didn’t email me yet but I’m assuming it would be in a week or two.
"
4792,"[6/29/20, 3:18:50 PM] Joe: I’m going to keep myself from getting too excited in case he never emails me 😂

4795,"[6/29/20, 3:22:24 PM] Joe: You’re probably right. He wouldn’t tell me he would email me if he wasn’t going to.
"
4796,"[6/29/20, 3:23:07 PM] Joe: I don’t know for how long. Seemed like an ongoing project. I’ll have to see what the contract looks like that he sends
"
4797,"[6/29/20, 3:25:35 PM] Joe: It’s not really going to have hours per day. More like, get the work done within 2 weeks. Work however long and whenever you need to so you can finish it
"
4798,"[6/29/20, 3:26:20 PM] Joe: Haha it’s an app for IOS and Android
"
4799,"[6/29/20, 3:30:42 PM] Joe: It’s some music app or something like that.
"
4800,"[6/29/20, 3:32:06 PM] Joe: Not too sure. It’s something about music recommendations and it will work with different music apps. I don’t know. He didn’t explain it super well but it sounded interesting

"
4803,"[6/30/20, 7:10:33 AM] Joe: Thanks babe. I’m stoked.
"
4804,"[6/30/20, 7:13:06 AM] Joe: I need to start waking up earlier again. Then I can talk to you in the mornings for longer before I go to work. I’ve been lazy lately, waking up at the last minute
"
4805,"[6/30/20, 7:13:26 AM] Joe: And I always fall asleep right around the time you wake up haha
"
4806,"[6/30/20, 7:17:23 AM] Joe: Hah yeah our schedules our messed up right now. I’ll do better though
"
4807,"[6/30/20, 7:17:47 AM] Joe: Today was shit? What happened?

4811,"[6/30/20, 7:23:46 AM] Joe: Fucking coronavirus dammit. Ugh
"
4812,"[6/30/20, 7:31:40 AM] Joe: Hahah my passport should be coming right around the time camp ends unless it’s really delayed
"
4813,"[6/30/20, 7:31:58 AM] Joe: So it’s perfect
"
4814,"[6/30/20, 7:32:51 AM] Joe: I have Apple Music and they make a favorite playlist every week. This week is the first time they added some of the spanish music you sent me haha. I must be listening to it a lot
"
4815,"[6/30/20, 7:43:06 AM] Joe: Haha yeah we’ll see. If I make it to you first, then they can reimplement the quarantine as long as they want 😂
"
4816,"[6/30/20, 7:43:19 AM] Joe: Mmmm 😋
"
4817,"[6/30/20, 7:44:48 AM] Joe: They put a song by Los Delinqüentes. Tartarichi. I listen to their album a lot haha
"
4818,"[6/30/20, 7:52:54 AM] Joe: Hahah I don’t go a pick that song to listen to. It just plays a lot from when I play the album
"

4859,"[7/1/20, 7:50:03 AM] Joe: He said we’ll talk more today and possibly start “on boarding”. Not sure if I’ll actually start working or just get setup with access to the codebase and all that.
"
4860,"[7/1/20, 7:50:19 AM] Joe: Do the contract and non-disclosures and all that
"
4861,"[7/1/20, 7:51:38 AM] Joe: The schedule is basically every 2 weeks I need to complete 1-2 task that have been assigned to me. Doesn’t matter how many hours it takes

"
4877,"[7/1/20, 10:41:39 AM] Joe: Hahaha I figured. You said you don’t even really like the idea of marriage that much.
"
4878,"[7/1/20, 10:42:17 AM] Joe: But that’s good. I hope that goes well. I should’ve used all my extra time this morning to make breakfast or pack a lunch. I’m hella hungry
"

"
4882,"[7/1/20, 11:33:58 AM] Joe: Sorry I was attending to injured children. They were dropping like flys for a minute there
"
4883,"[7/1/20, 11:34:41 AM] Joe: Getting through a whole day with no injuries is tough
"
4884,"[7/1/20, 11:45:52 AM] Joe: No worries, I’m almost out of here. I bring them to get lunch in a few minutes and then they go home
"
4885,"[7/1/20, 1:46:19 PM] Joe: I don’t know when this guy is going to call me 🤷‍♂️ still waiting
"
4886,"‎[7/1/20, 2:14:06 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
4887,"[7/1/20, 2:15:02 PM] Joe: I guess I told him I’m free after 1pm and he never really confirmed the exact time he would contact me. So I guess I just have to wait around for his call
"
4888,"[7/1/20, 2:19:44 PM] Joe: Yesterday he was free after 3pm so I’m assuming he’ll call around that time. I’m not doing anything anyway so it’s fine
"
4889,"[7/1/20, 2:21:05 PM] Joe: I just finished eating some ribs. I do kind of want another snack though 🤔
"
4890,"[7/1/20, 2:31:14 PM] Joe: I’m just going to keep eating snacks until he calls. I think I might have some grapes or something
"
4891,"[7/1/20, 2:32:57 PM] Joe: Interesting choice haha is it good? I don’t think I’ve had a wine with lemon in it
"
4892,"[7/1/20, 3:08:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
4893,"[7/1/20, 3:09:20 PM] Joe: Noooo still no call. I’m going to end up taking a nap haha

4895,"[7/1/20, 3:16:48 PM] Joe: He just never confirmed when he would contact me. Terrible.

"
4897,"[7/1/20, 3:19:54 PM] Joe: True. Alright maybe I’ll send a text or something.
"
4898,"[7/1/20, 3:23:00 PM] Joe: Awww no I didn’t knooow

4899,"[7/1/20, 3:24:02 PM] Joe: Yo tambien te echo de menos babe

4902,"[7/1/20, 3:29:51 PM] Joe: Aaah so shitty. The US is having a cases go up and talking about slowing down opening up. I hate it.
"
4903,"[7/1/20, 3:30:36 PM] Joe: Saaaame. They can lock us down as long as they want if I can just get to you first.
"
4904,"[7/1/20, 3:30:54 PM] Joe: I just don’t want to be so far away anymore
"
4905,"[7/1/20, 3:36:52 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck
"
4906,"[7/1/20, 3:37:17 PM] Joe: Of course I’m coming! That’s all I’m trying to do haha
"
4907,"[7/1/20, 3:37:53 PM] Joe: People keeps asking if I’m staying for good since I came back from Hawaii...I always tell them I want to go to Spain when I can
"
4908,"[7/1/20, 3:40:34 PM] Joe: Everyone is pretty stoked for me
"
4909,"[7/1/20, 3:42:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah the people that I tell why I’m going know
"
4910,"[7/1/20, 3:52:11 PM] Joe: I bet some people think it’s a little crazy and don’t want to say anything haha. But I really don’t see why not
"
4911,"[7/1/20, 3:59:38 PM] Joe: Honestly when you told me you didn’t have much patience early on, I was a little nervous that you wouldn’t wait. I’m really glad you’re holding out so long haha
"
4912,"[7/1/20, 3:59:47 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
4913,"[7/1/20, 4:02:21 PM] Joe: This place looks epic

"
4917,"[7/1/20, 4:07:02 PM] Joe: Haha you can’t win them all
"
4918,"[7/1/20, 4:07:36 PM] Joe: It’s ok. You can make fun of my gif selection anytime. Sometimes those are the best option haha
"
4919,"[7/1/20, 4:08:07 PM] Joe: Ok cool. Not so bad then. Glad it wasn’t 3 strikes and I’m out
"
4920,"[7/1/20, 4:08:59 PM] Joe: We’ve probably sent a whole episode worth of Mr Bean with gifs hahaha
"
4921,"[7/1/20, 4:11:43 PM] Joe: Oh thank you haha I try
"
4922,"[7/1/20, 4:12:10 PM] Joe: I pass that picture everyday on the way to work now haha. Mr Bean stares at me at that stoplight every morning

4924,"[7/1/20, 4:18:10 PM] Joe: Haha I was sleepy but then I got up and started to eat some food instead of taking a nap. But we can talk later if you want. I always enjoy talking to you.
"
4925,"[7/1/20, 4:26:08 PM] Joe: Looks like a beautiful night. Enjoy it. I’ll talk to you later babe. Buenas noches 😘
"
4926,"[7/2/20, 3:37:52 AM] Joe: Hahah you’re like me. I never say anything either
"
4927,"[7/2/20, 3:38:00 AM] Joe: That’s hella cool though
"
4928,"[7/2/20, 3:38:21 AM] Joe: Don’t worry I fell asleep way too early. Now I’m laying here regretting it
"
4929,"[7/2/20, 3:48:35 AM] Joe: Don’t worry you didn’t wake me up. But I’m going to try and go back to sleep now haha. Have a good day! Talk to you soon

"
4933,"[7/2/20, 6:50:25 AM] Joe: He called me back yesterday at around 4pm. But when we talked he didn’t set much up and ended up scheduling another call tomorrow but said we’d probably get started when he calls
"
4934,"[7/2/20, 6:52:22 AM] Joe: Haha I want to see how you interact with people in general but I would especially like to see this “less polite” Lore 😂
"

"
4936,"[7/2/20, 7:03:32 AM] Joe: Hahaha the bosses probably hate that 😂 I like it though.

"
4940,"[7/2/20, 7:12:47 AM] Joe: Hahaha “y cerveza??”
"
4941,"[7/2/20, 7:16:56 AM] Joe: I kind of like the idea of working hard for a few months and taking a bunch of time off haha I think I make most of the money I get all year in the summer time
"
4942,"[7/2/20, 7:17:38 AM] Joe: Only the best for you haha
"
4943,"[7/2/20, 7:42:30 AM] Joe: Haha true. I was going to move but I think since I’m only here till August i might as well save 2 months of rent. Plus my dad is redoing the house to sell it soon so I can help him out
"
4944,"[7/2/20, 7:44:05 AM] Joe: That’s good. I was hella trying to remember the one you like to drink. Alhambra especial 1933 or something like that hahah I don’t remember exactly.
"
4945,"[7/2/20, 7:46:40 AM] Joe: They’re going to move to Hawaii most likely. Join the rest of the family that’s out there haha.
"
4946,"[7/2/20, 7:47:00 AM] Joe: Shit I was close hahah
"
4947,"[7/2/20, 7:49:10 AM] Joe: Yeah but I have lots of cousins, uncles, and aunts still here in California. Boom Boom says Hawaii is too hot for him. He doesn’t like it 😂
"
4948,"[7/2/20, 7:53:18 AM] Joe: Haha true. He was excited about his little avocados on his tree so he’d love those big Hawaiian avocados.
"
4949,"[7/2/20, 7:59:50 AM] Joe: Hahaha
"
4950,"[7/2/20, 8:00:20 AM] Joe: It’s time for me to go to work now 😔

"
4955,"[7/2/20, 9:12:30 AM] Joe: I’m done checking in kids so I get to take off the goggles now
"
4956,"[7/2/20, 9:12:57 AM] Joe: But I have to do stretches now and start skating I guess
"
4957,"[7/2/20, 10:02:09 AM] Joe: Only if they ask. They’re doing their own thing mostly now. Learning from each other and I just give tips now and then
"

"
4959,"[7/2/20, 12:34:04 PM] Joe: It was pretty good today. No camp tomorrow so I just have to work on the coding stuff once the guy calls me
"
4960,"[7/2/20, 12:40:46 PM] Joe: Sky is pretty. Have fun. Where you going?
"
4961,"[7/2/20, 12:46:43 PM] Joe: Sweeeeet
"
4962,"[7/2/20, 12:47:39 PM] Joe: That’s awesome. I almost had a 3 day weekend but I feel I’m going to spend most of it learning the technology for the job haha.
"
4963,"[7/2/20, 1:05:12 PM] Joe: Either go skate and film, try to learn some coding stuff or some more spanish, or go to my friends house. Depends on the day but usually i get lunch after i get off then decide what to do.
"
4964,"[7/2/20, 1:15:02 PM] Joe: Oh yeah i guess that's true.
"
4965,"[7/2/20, 1:16:32 PM] Joe: I have nothing to teach you haha i learn in a weird way. I just listen to stuff i don't know and keep looking up words until it sticks. I never feel like i learned something at the end of the day. I only notice it's working when i don't have to use the translator as much or i understand something i didn't before
"
4966,"[7/2/20, 1:17:17 PM] Joe: I'm really trying to practice hearing all the words that people say but it's hard to know when some words end and others start when i don't know the word they're saying in the first place haha
"
4967,"[7/2/20, 1:17:48 PM] Joe: They're going to be soo happy to see you
"
4968,"[7/2/20, 2:16:53 PM] Joe: I learn every time i talk to you a little more
"
4969,"[7/2/20, 2:18:02 PM] Joe: Haha i mean, there isn't anything in particular i think i need to learn. Not that i can think of anyway. But i have been picking up a lot from talking to you.
"
4970,"[7/2/20, 2:18:43 PM] Joe: I don't have to use the translator as often haha and sometimes i use it just to double check or because i don't know only a few of the words. I'm getting better
"
4971,"[7/2/20, 2:19:36 PM] Joe: hahah i can't wait
"
4972,"[7/2/20, 2:20:09 PM] Joe: it'll be pretty funny haha damn hopefully i can communicate enough to keep you entertained
"
4973,"[7/2/20, 2:20:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
4974,"[7/2/20, 2:23:08 PM] Joe: Hahaha dammit
"
4975,"[7/2/20, 2:23:26 PM] Joe: Yeah but what about when i talk to you? That'll be good too haha
"
4976,"[7/2/20, 2:23:39 PM] Joe: blahblahblah
"
4977,"[7/2/20, 2:24:00 PM] Joe: ahha for sure
"
4978,"[7/2/20, 2:25:55 PM] Joe: How? Freak out?
"
4979,"[7/2/20, 2:25:58 PM] Joe: hahaha
"
4980,"[7/2/20, 2:26:13 PM] Joe: I'm going to be the best mime in the world
"
4981,"[7/2/20, 2:30:13 PM] Joe: Hahaha i like it. Totally fine with me 😂
"
4982,"[7/2/20, 2:40:33 PM] Joe: I'm really excited. Things are falling into place, except the possibility of another quarantine. But i have the passport coming and now i got my remote job.
"
4983,"[7/2/20, 2:40:46 PM] Joe: I wish i could just go today hahah mother fuckers
"
4984,"[7/2/20, 2:41:14 PM] Joe: I'm trying to read all these different things about the project i'm supposed to do for the guy haha
"
4985,"[7/2/20, 2:41:25 PM] Joe: https://gaugr.com/gaugrtools

4986,"[7/2/20, 2:41:39 PM] Joe: this is the tool or whatever that i'm going to work on
"
4987,"[7/2/20, 2:58:31 PM] Joe: We’ve been talking a lot still I think. Just not as much as the beginning of quarantine haha. I was talking to you all day every day
"
4988,"[7/2/20, 3:09:14 PM] Joe: haha for sure! I have a really big album full of the videos and pictures you send me
"
4989,"[7/2/20, 3:10:14 PM] Joe: That's very true. I guess i've already asked a lot of the main things i wanted to know about you. We kind of skipped the small talk but now we can't escape it hahah
"
4990,"[7/2/20, 3:11:02 PM] Joe: I'll have to think of some deep dark secret or something to tell you. Spice it up haha. Or i need to come up with some good questions.
"
4991,"[7/2/20, 3:19:54 PM] Joe: Yeah i like the same things about you. My mom was asking me what i like about you and that was basically the list i gave her. The way you look at life and your personality. I like to hear you laugh and i'm always smiling when i listen to the audio clips you send or watch the videos. Standing there like an idiot smiling with my phone in my hand hahah 😂😂
"
4992,"[7/2/20, 3:20:17 PM] Joe: Don't even understand half of what i'm hearing too haha
"
4993,"[7/2/20, 3:21:36 PM] Joe: But you seem ""lighthearted"" to me. And the fact that you would even entertain the idea of me visiting you and how you pursued me, i find it all very interesting haha
"
4994,"[7/2/20, 3:46:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i try to speak slowly and clearly as i can. Sometimes i forget. And the mask makes it extra difficult to understand me i'm sure
"
4995,"[7/2/20, 3:47:01 PM] Joe: It's funny, when you talk fast, the first time i listen i don't hear anything haha but after i pick up the words i can't stop hearing it when i listen again. Practicing listening to you really helps
"
4996,"[7/2/20, 3:48:24 PM] Joe: Haha you were definitely good at making me nervous at the beginning. Always making me do stuff a little outside of my normal
"
4997,"[7/2/20, 3:48:54 PM] Joe: It was good though. It made it fun. Like when you started asking me to send you audio in spanish 😂 oh god
"
4998,"[7/2/20, 3:49:17 PM] Joe: I would try so hard to not sound absolutely ridiculous haha
"
4999,"[7/2/20, 3:49:24 PM] Joe: ronronear
"
5000,"[7/2/20, 3:51:13 PM] Joe: Haha yeah like going in the water so early in the morning
"
5001,"[7/2/20, 3:51:21 PM] Joe: oooh that was so cold haha
"
5002,"[7/2/20, 3:51:30 PM] Joe: It was nice though
"
5003,"[7/2/20, 3:52:15 PM] Joe: I bet that helped a lot. I was your window into the outside world.
"
5004,"[7/2/20, 3:52:46 PM] Joe: Aaaaah hahaha i forgot about that one hahahaha
"
5005,"[7/2/20, 3:52:47 PM] Joe: shit
"
5006,"[7/2/20, 3:53:12 PM] Joe: Well...i told you i'd send you a video of those things, so i did
"
5007,"[7/2/20, 3:54:46 PM] Joe: I don't know why but when i watch a video you send from WhatsApp it downloads it to my phone. So i made an album with all the stuff you send me. Easy to find...i'll save them for when i need to embarrass you haha
"
5008,"[7/2/20, 3:55:13 PM] Joe: Just kidding i wouldn't do that, don't stop sending videos😂
"
5009,"[7/2/20, 3:56:24 PM] Joe: What? Which one?
"
5010,"[7/2/20, 3:59:39 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha shiiiiit
"
5011,"[7/2/20, 3:59:51 PM] Joe: I knew i shouldn't have sent those 😂
"
5012,"[7/2/20, 4:00:22 PM] Joe: Seriously that's the first time i've every taken a picture and sent it to someone like that haha
"
5013,"[7/2/20, 4:01:15 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, spitfire haha
"
5014,"[7/2/20, 4:01:42 PM] Joe: Wait did I? I don't remember hahaha
"
5015,"[7/2/20, 4:02:03 PM] Joe: Haha i don't know how you convinced me to do so much from so far away
"
5016,"[7/2/20, 4:02:46 PM] Joe: 🙉🙈🙈 Aaaaah hahah delete them 😂
"
5017,"[7/2/20, 4:05:32 PM] Joe: Oh i know the one
"

"
5019,"[7/2/20, 4:05:53 PM] Joe: My favorite hahah
"
5020,"[7/2/20, 4:07:58 PM] Joe: Hahahaha that was so strange to me when you asked that. I was thinking to myself, ""what kind of vibes am i giving off here!?""
"
5021,"[7/2/20, 4:11:15 PM] Joe: Saaame
"
5022,"[7/2/20, 4:12:25 PM] Joe: Damn i like how i've done things with you that i haven't done with anyone else haha. All cause of the distance. But it's such a different way of getting to know someone. There is literally no option to skip the talking part of it all
"
5023,"[7/2/20, 4:14:20 PM] Joe: No i don't feel uncomfortable with it. I enjoyed it haha
"
5024,"[7/2/20, 4:15:15 PM] Joe: I must really like you to be convinced to do it in the first place though haha. Shit, i didn't even have WhatsApp until you told me to download it so we could get off instagram
"
5025,"[7/2/20, 4:16:16 PM] Joe: Exactly 😊
"
5026,"[7/2/20, 4:17:59 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha to be convinced to have ""WhatsApp sex"" in the first place hahah
"
5027,"[7/2/20, 4:19:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i only got super horny because you sent me sexy videos. Mmmmm very sexy videos lasnjdob
"
5028,"[7/2/20, 4:20:35 PM] Joe: I'll try to take the initiative sometime haha sorry, i'm not great at that from a distance.
"
5029,"[7/2/20, 4:21:38 PM] Joe: Haha that dog loves to cuddle with you
"
5030,"[7/2/20, 4:24:20 PM] Joe: Hella sweet!
"
5031,"[7/2/20, 4:24:42 PM] Joe: Also, i don't know how the hell i didn't notice you have a nose ring until now hahah
"
5032,"[7/2/20, 4:25:31 PM] Joe: Mmm hahah you make this difficult for me 😂
"
5033,"[7/2/20, 4:26:09 PM] Joe: You need a better camera 😂😂
"
5034,"[7/2/20, 4:26:42 PM] Joe: Just kidding haha i'm sorry i never noticed your nose ring 🙃
"
5035,"[7/2/20, 4:27:16 PM] Joe: I don't know why i never saw it...i'm blind. It's cute though 🤷‍♂️
"
5036,"[7/2/20, 4:27:53 PM] Joe: Hahahaha don't beat me up
"
5037,"[7/2/20, 4:29:07 PM] Joe: Haha rocked that kangaroo
"
5038,"[7/2/20, 4:29:50 PM] Joe: The kangaroo looks like it wants to beat that dudes ass haha good gif
"
5039,"[7/2/20, 4:33:13 PM] Joe: I'm totally not jealous of your dog right now ahha
"
5040,"[7/2/20, 4:33:36 PM] Joe: And did you flip me off?? hahaha
"
5041,"[7/2/20, 4:36:19 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look trapped
"
5042,"[7/2/20, 4:36:40 PM] Joe: But it's so cute haha the dog with it's arm on you. Lot's of love
"
5043,"[7/2/20, 4:43:33 PM] Joe: I want some animals to cuddle with me haha. Dookie still isn’t feeling well so he isn’t having any of my shit when I try to get him to sit near me
"
5044,"[7/2/20, 4:44:21 PM] Joe: Hah there won’t be any room for me when the dogs are around
"
5045,"‎[7/2/20, 4:45:36 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
5046,"[7/2/20, 4:46:09 PM] Joe: Those are his favorite treats and he is usually a little fatty so he must not be feeling well since he isn’t really eating
"
5047,"[7/2/20, 4:47:22 PM] Joe: True. I love socks.
"
5048,"[7/2/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, they didn’t really find much. They ended up saying he has acid reflex or something like that. But then he had another appointment and might have some kind of infection
"
5049,"[7/2/20, 4:48:54 PM] Joe: Naaaaah, the best
"
5050,"[7/2/20, 4:49:28 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t know what’s wrong with him but he has an attitude and doesn’t like to be touched right now but usually he doesn’t mind
"
5051,"[7/2/20, 4:51:54 PM] Joe: Yeah poor little dude. He is super grumpy haha

"
5055,"[7/2/20, 4:57:46 PM] Joe: Oh yeah Elvis has super long hair and leaves it everywhere. He’s a cool cat though. Let’s you pick him up and carry him like a baby hahah
"
5056,"[7/2/20, 4:58:54 PM] Joe: Hahahhh whoops 😂

"
5059,"[7/2/20, 5:28:37 PM] Joe: I honestly don’t have a good grasp on how much English you know haha I know that you know some for sure. I guess it’s hard to describe how much you know and don’t know.
"
5060,"[7/2/20, 5:29:07 PM] Joe: I wonder if you know more english than I know spanish 🤔
"
5061,"[7/2/20, 5:38:00 PM] Joe: Well if I’m coming to Spain I’ll probably have more spanish than you have english eventually. But then if you want to come to the US to see me you’ll need to learn more engliiish
"
5062,"[7/2/20, 5:38:16 PM] Joe: So you can go to Hawaii hahaha
"
5063,"[7/2/20, 5:38:56 PM] Joe: I’m looking forward to visiting you in Spain but it would be the dream to be on an island with you somewhere in the world haha. One day
"
5064,"[7/2/20, 5:42:58 PM] Joe: You’ll just have to have a “green card marriage” hahaha
"
5065,"[7/2/20, 5:43:05 PM] Joe: Just kidding just kidding
"
5066,"[7/2/20, 5:44:06 PM] Joe: I’m sure you’ll be able to come at least to visit someday. Fuck Trump haha
"
5067,"[7/2/20, 5:44:47 PM] Joe: We’ll go on the tv show “90 day fiancé” 😂
"
5068,"[7/2/20, 5:47:29 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
"
5069,"[7/2/20, 5:47:35 PM] Joe: I’m just kidding
"
5070,"[7/2/20, 5:47:55 PM] Joe: That would be siiiick. Perfect place with the mix of spanish and english hahah
"
5071,"[7/2/20, 5:49:02 PM] Joe: For sure! She likes that show too much haha. It’s funny to watch it now that I’ve been talking to you for so long
"
5072,"[7/2/20, 5:49:52 PM] Joe: Sometimes I think what we’re doing is crazy...but then I see that show hahaha
"
5073,"[7/2/20, 5:51:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh it’s a crazy show haha. The person will go to another country to meet someone they have never met. Then they have to get married in 90 days or the person would have to go back to their country
"
5074,"[7/2/20, 5:52:39 PM] Joe: Oh yeah definitely.
"
5075,"[7/2/20, 5:53:09 PM] Joe: But yeah, the show is wild. I’m sure much of it is staged but supposedly some of the people really get married
"
5076,"[7/2/20, 5:56:01 PM] Joe: Haha oh that’ll be good. I’m looking forward to hearing your reaction.
"
5077,"[7/2/20, 5:56:59 PM] Joe: Damn I wonder what TV is like in other places now. Hopefully I’ll be finding out soon enough but I never really thought about the differences in TV around the world
"
5078,"[7/2/20, 6:00:46 PM] Joe: Are you watching already?
"
5079,"[7/2/20, 6:02:45 PM] Joe: Hahaha i haven’t seen a lot of the people but I didn’t like the ones that I saw very much
"
5080,"[7/2/20, 6:04:44 PM] Joe: Hahah you’re just going to judge all the people 😂 I wonder why they decide to go on the show. They must pay for a bunch of stuff or something. I don’t get it
"
5081,"[7/2/20, 6:07:34 PM] Joe: You judging the people is entertaining to me 🤷‍♂️ I think it’s funny the things you notice or point out to me. But yeah, real life is ok, on tv though 😬
"
5082,"[7/2/20, 6:08:43 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that can happen. Even with phrases, you can start off saying something as a joke and eventually you’re really using the phrase haha
"
5083,"[7/2/20, 6:09:18 PM] Joe: I’m going to watch La Casa De Papel over and over until I understand everyone 😂
"
5084,"[7/2/20, 6:10:29 PM] Joe: Haha like when you were judging those ladies with the annoying voices. I don’t know how to describe it but you seem like such a nice person that when I hear you talk like that it makes me laugh
"
5085,"[7/2/20, 6:12:05 PM] Joe: Perfect haha
"
5086,"[7/2/20, 6:12:52 PM] Joe: Hahahah
"
5087,"[7/2/20, 6:13:05 PM] Joe: Mischievous
"
5088,"[7/2/20, 6:16:57 PM] Joe: Hahaha 😂
"
5089,"[7/2/20, 6:17:09 PM] Joe: She had to share with a video haha
"
5090,"[7/2/20, 6:21:32 PM] Joe: Hahaha yes her outfit is not very flattering on her
"
5091,"[7/2/20, 6:26:21 PM] Joe: Hahah if I ever judge you, the only conclusion I come to at the end is that you’re beautiful
"
5092,"[7/2/20, 6:27:00 PM] Joe: I enjoy it. Say whatever about whoever haha

"
5096,"[7/2/20, 6:33:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn this gif makes me think about how little I talked at first every time you send it 😂
"
5097,"[7/2/20, 6:38:48 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s rare for me to compliment too 😂 I guess you’ve noticed. Well in case I don’t say anything like that for a while, I’ll say it now, I think you’re beautiful and funny and smart. I love your attitude towards life and the fun we have just spending hours talking through WhatsApp haha. I think you’re the best

"
5105,"[7/2/20, 6:47:48 PM] Joe: I seriously have no interest in girls at the moment besides you. Shit, before you messaged me I was very content being alone 🤷‍♂️ but something about you won me over

"
5111,"[7/2/20, 6:57:30 PM] Joe: 😬
"
5112,"[7/2/20, 6:57:31 PM] Joe: Hahah
"
5113,"[7/2/20, 6:58:10 PM] Joe: Don’t worry you can tell me anything.
"
5114,"[7/2/20, 6:58:32 PM] Joe: I’m glad I haven’t had to have that conversation with anyone yet 🤣
"
5115,"[7/2/20, 7:00:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha well I doubt that I would ever have that conversation
"
5116,"[7/2/20, 7:00:27 PM] Joe: But I would tell you if I did.
"
5117,"[7/2/20, 7:00:58 PM] Joe: I would tell you anything that you should know. I trust you and I hope you trust me too at this point to be honest with you.
"
5118,"[7/2/20, 7:06:00 PM] Joe: Haha yeah pretty simple I guess

"
5121,"[7/2/20, 7:12:29 PM] Joe: Hahahah
"
5122,"[7/2/20, 7:12:40 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll let you know. But it’s not happening.
"
5123,"[7/2/20, 7:12:48 PM] Joe: If you get tired of waiting, let me know haha
"
5124,"[7/2/20, 7:13:25 PM] Joe: Ok sleep well! I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches babe 😘
"
5125,"[7/2/20, 7:15:40 PM] Joe: My meeting.m? With the guy? He never called!! He texted me at 2:15 asking if I was ready to get started, I texted back saying I was ready...and nothing
"
5126,"[7/2/20, 7:16:39 PM] Joe: Haha but me and you? We’re meeting babe. For sure. It’s happening. Anyway, get some sleep. Buenas nochesss
"
5127,"[7/2/20, 7:21:41 PM] Joe: Yeah he is being weird but the product looks legit. I sent you a link. They have an iOS and Android app too.
"
5128,"[7/2/20, 7:22:06 PM] Joe: We’ll see what happens. I don’t understand either haha

5131,"[7/2/20, 7:23:16 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️ I’ll call him
"
5132,"[7/2/20, 7:24:22 PM] Joe: It’s always text or email that he has been unreliable. He can’t avoid me on the phone. But we just talked on the phone yesterday and it seemed like we were going to start today. Whatever.
"
5133,"[7/2/20, 7:25:02 PM] Joe: I’ll figure it out
"
5134,"[7/2/20, 7:25:17 PM] Joe: Last chance for him haha
"
5135,"[7/2/20, 7:25:55 PM] Joe: It did give me more time to study up on what I need to know so that’s good but yeah, tomorrow is his last chance haha

"
5151,"[7/3/20, 6:36:51 AM] Joe: Aaaah I passed out last night haha my bad
"
5152,"[7/3/20, 6:38:10 AM] Joe: Those dogs belong to my friends upstairs neighbor. Usually they don’t like to be around strangers I guess but they were chillin last night haha

"
5165,"[7/3/20, 1:32:09 PM] Joe: I like your laugh. It’s infectious haha but yeah sleeping out there would be sick. Go camping or something. I’m sure that’s not allowed though.
"
5166,"[7/3/20, 1:32:22 PM] Joe: But the place you went looked awesome
"
5167,"[7/3/20, 1:37:13 PM] Joe: Haha sobre de dormir
"
5168,"[7/3/20, 1:37:42 PM] Joe: Sobre sobres
"
5169,"[7/3/20, 1:39:08 PM] Joe: We’re totally going camping someday haha
"
5170,"[7/3/20, 1:41:29 PM] Joe: Oooh yeaaaaah!!!
"
5171,"[7/3/20, 1:41:38 PM] Joe: I forgot hahah good memory
"
5172,"[7/3/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I knew I learned about “sobre” somewhere before
"
5173,"[7/3/20, 1:43:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha my favorite word. I’m so good at saying it
"
5174,"[7/3/20, 1:45:40 PM] Joe: Haha that was unexpected from you but I like it 😆 I miss you too! I wish I was there to have fun with you on a day like today
"
5175,"[7/3/20, 1:50:56 PM] Joe: Hahah uh oh impulsive Lore is here after a couple of beers and smoking 😂
"
5176,"[7/3/20, 1:51:42 PM] Joe: You’re hilarious. I need to see you in person hahaha ugh stop being far away
"
5177,"[7/3/20, 1:51:58 PM] Joe: Oh, and that dude told me Monday now 🙄

5179,"[7/3/20, 1:57:42 PM] Joe: Yeah he just said he got busy and that he would send me the non-disclosures and contract through email and we’ll start Monday 🤷‍♂️
"
5180,"[7/3/20, 1:57:56 PM] Joe: I’ll believe it when I get paid 😂
"
5181,"[7/3/20, 2:03:17 PM] Joe: Yeah and I’ll make sure to read the contact good haha
"
5182,"[7/3/20, 2:04:09 PM] Joe: If anything I’ll learn the technology and add it to my resume. Its use is super common for building apps so it’s a valuable skill
"
5183,"[7/3/20, 2:13:06 PM] Joe: Well I’ve worked for a company but it wasn’t as an employee. Similar to this project but not as big. Always contract work or consulting.
"
5184,"[7/3/20, 2:26:39 PM] Joe: I’m about to skate and film babe. But I’m glad you had a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😘

5192,"[7/3/20, 11:09:15 PM] Joe: Getting ready to go to a waterfall or something with Kyle and his girlfriend tomorrow. I don’t know exactly, they made the plans and asked if I wanted to go. But we leave early so I’m staying here tonight.
"
5193,"[7/3/20, 11:09:22 PM] Joe: My turn for some nature haha
"
5194,"[7/3/20, 11:21:21 PM] Joe: Aaah we had to send the little dogs back to their own house 😞
"

5210,"[7/4/20, 7:32:14 AM] Joe: Like specific places? So many places to name haha
"
5211,"[7/4/20, 7:35:50 AM] Joe: But the United States is so big I’ve barely seen much even though I have a decent list I guess. I’ve been to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and New York. Still have a lot I haven’t seen
"
5212,"[7/4/20, 7:40:39 AM] Joe: I liked Washington the most but I only went in summer. I heard it is cloudy and rainy most of the year
"
5213,"[7/4/20, 7:41:57 AM] Joe: So I don’t know if I’d like it all year around. Texas was too hot, dry, and flat but at least it is relatively cheap to live there
"
5214,"[7/4/20, 7:43:25 AM] Joe: New York had too many people. I forgot I also went to New Jersey and Pennsylvania too, same trip as New York. East coast is very densely packed compared to when you go out west.
"
5215,"[7/4/20, 7:43:51 AM] Joe: Arizona was hot and a hella racist haha
"
5216,"[7/4/20, 7:45:35 AM] Joe: Oregon is cool. My brother lives there. Great for outdoor stuff. They get snow in the winter, summer and spring are pretty nice. I have to drive a couple of hours to the mountains for snow here.
"
5217,"[7/4/20, 7:50:06 AM] Joe: Haha Texas is pretty racist too. The whole southern part of the states is kind of racist 😬
"
5218,"[7/4/20, 7:50:53 AM] Joe: Oh yeah California is really nice. Ideal weather and have access to all kinds of cool places
"
5219,"[7/4/20, 7:54:34 AM] Joe: Haha no that’s like 8 hours away from me. I rarely go to Southern California
"
5220,"[7/4/20, 7:56:17 AM] Joe: Also, the water is cold at the beaches here. Not the most pleasant unless it’s super hot. Not like tropical waters at all haha
"
5221,"[7/4/20, 8:06:05 AM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s far too. A lot beaches you think of are probably around San Diego
"
5222,"[7/4/20, 8:10:25 AM] Joe: That’s tight! Super far from me though haha. Almost at the California/Mexico border
"
5223,"[7/4/20, 8:18:26 AM] Joe: Haha a little closer but still Southern California

"
5229,"[7/4/20, 8:30:04 AM] Joe: We took his other car. Automatic gears ⚙️
"
5230,"[7/4/20, 8:32:30 AM] Joe: Haha it’s her leash. We stopped recently to let the dogs out for a bit
"
5231,"[7/4/20, 8:43:33 AM] Joe: It’s rare to drive with moving the gears here haha. Super. Having manual gears is the best security for a car here cause people don’t know how to drive them, so they can’t steal them

"
5295,"[7/5/20, 8:47:12 AM] Joe: Damn you’re already doing it haha adding a bunch of stuff I see. Thanks babe!

5298,"[7/5/20, 8:50:26 AM] Joe: Hahaha I can imagine a concert of this band being fun. Good energy to dance and jump around to. Get everyone hyped up
"
5299,"[7/5/20, 8:51:12 AM] Joe: This song sounds like it would be in a montage of a movie. Like a super epic part that’s all feel good and shit 😂
"
5300,"[7/5/20, 8:54:53 AM] Joe: Hahah damn that’s wild. I haven’t gone to too many concerts but they’re fun. I like the outdoor festivals with concerts haha. Those are fun

5320,"[7/5/20, 9:52:43 AM] Joe: I need to go get a new one or get this fixed as soon as possible before it goes out on me
"
5321,"[7/5/20, 9:54:48 AM] Joe: I always drop it but it just started happening randomly a week or two ago. Very slightly. But now it’s getting worse
"
5322,"[7/5/20, 10:08:38 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I guess so 🤷‍♂️ hopefully it doesn’t break for a little while longer. Just need a few more weeks

5346,"[7/6/20, 6:52:38 AM] Joe: We didn’t set anything up for today. Last time I talked to him he said he would send all the contacts and stuff 🤷‍♂️
"
5347,"[7/6/20, 6:52:46 AM] Joe: Good idea
"
5348,"[7/6/20, 6:53:45 AM] Joe: Haha good. I got a super short morning conversation with you just in time 😂
"
5349,"[7/6/20, 6:54:44 AM] Joe: You’re very right. Thanks for the advice babe I appreciate it
"
5350,"[7/6/20, 6:55:53 AM] Joe: Hah I know what you meant
"
5351,"[7/6/20, 6:58:51 AM] Joe: Ok babe sounds good. Have a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😊 😘
"
5352,"[7/6/20, 12:48:46 PM] Joe: Aaaah damn that sucks. I hate people like that. Need it their way even if that isn’t an option haha. Idiots.
"
5353,"[7/6/20, 12:50:07 PM] Joe: *buttons 
"
5354,"[7/6/20, 12:50:20 PM] Joe: Customers are the worst sometimes
"
5355,"[7/6/20, 2:22:10 PM] Joe: That's good. It sounds like for the most part the people are alright haha.
"
5356,"[7/6/20, 2:22:48 PM] Joe: I used to work at a few pharmacies, customers were always in a bad mood 😬
"
5357,"[7/6/20, 2:23:49 PM] Joe: That dude didn't answer my call. I think i'm over working with this guy 🤬
"
5358,"[7/6/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: I was really looking forward to working on a mobile app but i don't know what to do at this point. So frustrating. What a waste of time
"
5359,"[7/6/20, 2:26:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah i had to memorize all the drug names. I worked in pharmacy for like 5 years, i had to do a little school but not much. I wasn't the pharmacist, i was a pharmacy technician, which is like the assistant. Not a fun job hahah
"
5360,"[7/6/20, 2:27:05 PM] Joe: hahhahaa
"
5361,"[7/6/20, 2:27:45 PM] Joe: That's what i was worried about. Especially when he sent the NDA but not the contract for the work.
"
5362,"[7/6/20, 2:28:02 PM] Joe: I still haven't received a contract so yeah, i'm over it haha
"
5363,"[7/6/20, 2:28:24 PM] Joe: True
"
5364,"[7/6/20, 2:29:59 PM] Joe: Part of my job was to literally not answer questions like that, by law i had to get the pharmacist to recommend medication. I will tell you what i think would help if you ask me hahaha but at work i had to get a pharmacist even if i knew the answer
"
5365,"[7/6/20, 2:31:36 PM] Joe: Yeah i already wasted a bunch of time waiting for him.
"
5366,"[7/6/20, 2:31:57 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah for you i will answer
"
5367,"[7/6/20, 2:32:09 PM] Joe: Never
"
5368,"[7/6/20, 2:33:18 PM] Joe: Yeah i'm not too worried about it. I'm just going to keep working on what i can for now. My boss actually said he has a coding job he needs done for his other skate camp haha.
"
5369,"[7/6/20, 2:35:30 PM] Joe: hahaha
"
5370,"[7/6/20, 2:35:36 PM] Joe: 😂😂
"
5371,"[7/6/20, 2:36:17 PM] Joe: I tried not to get too excited about that job anyway.
"
5372,"[7/6/20, 2:36:57 PM] Joe: ugh
"
5373,"[7/6/20, 2:36:59 PM] Joe: whack
"
5374,"[7/6/20, 2:37:17 PM] Joe: I did want to get paid though haha
"
5375,"[7/6/20, 2:38:41 PM] Joe: Yeaaaaah. Whatever it's cool
"
5376,"[7/6/20, 2:38:48 PM] Joe: Life goes on haha
"
5377,"[7/6/20, 2:39:06 PM] Joe: They pay better than that
"
5378,"[7/6/20, 2:39:49 PM] Joe: That was mid-tier pay i would say. At least for the Bay Area but cost of living is crazy high here too so it makes sense
"
5379,"[7/6/20, 2:40:50 PM] Joe: They are paying for the time it took me to learn everything 😂😂
"
5380,"[7/6/20, 2:42:06 PM] Joe: Graphic designer, user interface designer, user experience designer all get very high pay too and can be remote
"
5381,"[7/6/20, 2:42:14 PM] Joe: You would be good at those jobs
"
5382,"[7/6/20, 2:43:34 PM] Joe: I really want to see how well you could design websites if you learned how to use the right tools and spent a tiny amount of time studying it. You already have a good eye which is hard to teach
"
5383,"[7/6/20, 2:44:40 PM] Joe: My designs suuuuuck!
"
5384,"[7/6/20, 2:45:59 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
5385,"[7/6/20, 2:46:09 PM] Joe: Damn you're right we haven't played in a while
"
5386,"[7/6/20, 2:47:00 PM] Joe: I think you would like it too. The way you would send me revisions to my designs, it seemed like you were enjoying it.
"
5387,"[7/6/20, 2:48:00 PM] Joe: I'm sure the 3D course can be tied into web design. You can make 3D assets for websites i bet hahah all kinds of crazy stuff needed on websites now
"
5388,"[7/6/20, 2:49:32 PM] Joe: It was honestly one of the things that made me like you a lot more haha. I could just feel your passion about trying to make it look nice. You weren't being paid, you didn't have to do it, but you wanted to and you tried to do a good job regardless. I appreciated that a lot.
"
5389,"[7/6/20, 2:51:25 PM] Joe: https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/adding-3d-models-to-your-website-d374a8cbbadd
"
5390,"[7/6/20, 2:51:37 PM] Joe: the article makes it seem not that hard haha
"
5391,"[7/6/20, 2:52:02 PM] Joe: Give me 3D model files of like a small object and i might be able to figure it out hahah
"
5392,"[7/6/20, 2:52:47 PM] Joe: But what i was saying was you could just do the 3D modeling part as a part of a team. You'd send the file of the 3D model to the programmer to insert into the website
"
5393,"[7/6/20, 2:54:43 PM] Joe: I'm trying to find an example haha
"
5394,"[7/6/20, 2:56:07 PM] Joe: Yes
"
5395,"[7/6/20, 2:56:29 PM] Joe: Have you ever been to a website that lets you rotate a 3D image to look at all sides of it?
"
5396,"[7/6/20, 2:56:46 PM] Joe: You would be the one to make that 3D model
"
5397,"[7/6/20, 2:56:58 PM] Joe: I can't find an example right now
"
5398,"[7/6/20, 2:58:04 PM] Joe: Yeah it seems frustrating. Probably why it pays well hah
"
5399,"[7/6/20, 2:58:48 PM] Joe: Well if you are ever desperate for a job that uses your new 3D modeling skills, look into it
"
5400,"[7/6/20, 2:59:32 PM] Joe: They can be short jobs to pad the resume haha. But i would support whatever you do 🤷‍♂️
"
5401,"[7/6/20, 3:00:42 PM] Joe: Aaah ok ok. You still need to send me more of your work so i can see it haha
"
5402,"[7/6/20, 3:01:48 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that's true. Back to real life haha
"
5403,"[7/6/20, 3:02:11 PM] Joe: That's cool you started it during quarantine though
"
5404,"[7/6/20, 3:02:57 PM] Joe: I'm sure you'll get it eventually. It'll just be a little slower than before
"
5405,"[7/6/20, 3:03:12 PM] Joe: Let me know when you're ready for dice and we will play again hahah
"
5406,"[7/6/20, 3:03:50 PM] Joe: Maybe when it's not so late there
"
5407,"[7/6/20, 3:05:26 PM] Joe: Definitely. I understand. I work best in the morning time so having to work camp in the morning makes it harder for me to do well with my programming.
"
5408,"[7/6/20, 3:06:08 PM] Joe: Oh we can play haha i just thought it was late there and you might want to go to sleep
"
5409,"[7/6/20, 3:06:31 PM] Joe: Or maybe not go to sleep yet, but not get kept up late by my dumb game 😂
"
5410,"[7/6/20, 3:07:35 PM] Joe: haha then let's play 😈
"
5411,"[7/6/20, 3:09:07 PM] Joe: Haha what's the room name?
"
5412,"[7/6/20, 3:09:50 PM] Joe: Hahahahah dammit
"
5413,"[7/6/20, 3:10:12 PM] Joe: Oh i know the name. You're on mobile though so it was probably a capital ""O""
"
5414,"[7/6/20, 3:11:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha
"
5415,"[7/6/20, 3:11:43 PM] Joe: It's ok. You are right in the end
"
5416,"[7/6/20, 3:12:11 PM] Joe: Aaah you got disconnected. My game still sucks. Sweet
"
5417,"[7/6/20, 3:13:44 PM] Joe: Ok i made it. Lower case ""o""
"
5418,"[7/6/20, 3:14:32 PM] Joe: Siii
"
5419,"[7/6/20, 3:16:08 PM] Joe: Oh haha yeah mobile is weird when entering the name of stuff for some reason
"
5420,"[7/6/20, 3:28:39 PM] Joe: I did too well hahah sorry 😬 I'll fix those dice on mobile, put them all in a row. Thanks for the tip!
"
5421,"[7/6/20, 3:29:55 PM] Joe: Hmmm interesting. Maybe there is a border on the dice or something? I'll try to fix that
"
5422,"[7/6/20, 3:31:31 PM] Joe: Oooooh yup that's probably a border or shadow setting. So it should just be flat looking dice right? No shadow or border would be better?
"
5423,"[7/6/20, 3:34:18 PM] Joe: You got disconnected from my room haha
"
5424,"[7/6/20, 3:34:32 PM] Joe: A while ago. That happens on mobile when you close the browser sometimes
"
5425,"[7/6/20, 3:35:28 PM] Joe: Nooooo totally disconnected. I know it doesn't look like it but that is only because my game sucks hahah
"
5426,"[7/6/20, 3:36:01 PM] Joe: hahah ok i wait
"
5427,"[7/6/20, 3:45:57 PM] Joe: Aaah disconnected.
"
5428,"[7/6/20, 3:46:01 PM] Joe: Was fun though hahah
"
5429,"[7/6/20, 3:46:41 PM] Joe: Oh your phone tried to reload the website i think
"
5430,"[7/6/20, 3:47:19 PM] Joe: I still haven't figured out how to fix that. Something to do with mobile. It never happens on computer. Or at least i haven't experienced it on a computer
"
5431,"[7/6/20, 3:48:14 PM] Joe: I should make an actual app for use on mobile phones. That way i can teach myself that technology i was supposed to be using and hopefully fix some of these weird issues that happen with mobile browsers
"
5432,"[7/6/20, 3:56:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry babe my dad was telling me something. I was distracted! I miss you I swear!!! Hahaha
"
5433,"[7/6/20, 3:59:39 PM] Joe: Hahaha

"
5437,"[7/6/20, 4:16:05 PM] Joe: I should probably start looking for more remote work now too since this guy is not coming through
"
5438,"[7/6/20, 4:16:15 PM] Joe: After food haha
"
5439,"[7/6/20, 4:17:54 PM] Joe: Hopefully i find something soon. I like coding work haha
"
5440,"[7/6/20, 4:17:58 PM] Joe: What are you doing?
"
5441,"[7/6/20, 4:21:15 PM] Joe: Hahah dammit
"
5442,"[7/6/20, 4:21:31 PM] Joe: Ok babe sleep well. I'll talk to you later. Buenas noches

"
5445,"[7/7/20, 12:10:14 PM] Joe: Such a short shift
"
5446,"[7/7/20, 12:13:14 PM] Joe: Haha the schedule actually works out for once
"
5447,"[7/7/20, 12:13:42 PM] Joe: It was so hot at the park today. I was dying. How was your day?
"
5448,"[7/7/20, 12:18:00 PM] Joe: Ooooh shit 😬
"
5449,"[7/7/20, 12:19:06 PM] Joe: Yeah it sounds painful haha. I can’t imagine

5451,"[7/7/20, 12:23:26 PM] Joe: Oh what?? That sounds terrible! People do such strange things sometimes haha
"
5452,"[7/7/20, 12:23:52 PM] Joe: Hahah niiiice 👍 😂
"
5453,"[7/7/20, 12:24:39 PM] Joe: I cannot imagine lasering my dick hahaha
"
5454,"[7/7/20, 12:24:53 PM] Joe: Fuck that would suck so bad
"
5455,"[7/7/20, 12:34:25 PM] Joe: Damn it’s so bad you need anesthetic the next day!? What the hell Lore! Why would you do that? hahahah
"
5456,"[7/7/20, 12:36:56 PM] Joe: I actually just learned concha the other day on Instagram haha. So random
"
5457,"[7/7/20, 12:40:10 PM] Joe: No wait....it was “chocho” I learned. Damn there is a lot of ways to say it haha
"

"
5459,"[7/7/20, 12:47:30 PM] Joe: Haha I sent you the post on Instagram where I learned it chocho.
"
5460,"[7/7/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: Aaah ok. Noted. So I’m guessing you would use the word concha most out of all the options??
"
5461,"[7/7/20, 12:56:35 PM] Joe: Haha the memes teach me a lot. Memes, music, and tv shows are my main sources of learning besides talking to you  😂
"
5462,"[7/7/20, 12:57:38 PM] Joe: I’ll try to remember that haha
"
5463,"[7/7/20, 12:59:03 PM] Joe: Dude my pinky finger hurts so bad. I think I sprained it 😣 I don’t know, it hurts to bend it now. I’m always injured haha
"
5464,"[7/7/20, 1:02:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks 😂
"
5465,"[7/7/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I just watch La Casa De Papel over and over hahaha and when I watch something in English I put Spanish subtitles
"
5466,"[7/7/20, 1:03:20 PM] Joe: Or if it has the option i put the audio in spanish if I’m watching a movie or something
"
5467,"[7/7/20, 1:04:25 PM] Joe: From earlier today. It’s just swollen like I jammed it. It’ll be fine in a few days

5468,"‎[7/7/20, 1:06:04 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
"
5469,"[7/7/20, 1:06:25 PM] Joe: Please do haha
"
5470,"[7/7/20, 1:07:29 PM] Joe: To answer your Instagram question....I can barely understand those people. Only some of what they are saying. I don’t understand most of it haha
"
5471,"[7/7/20, 1:09:01 PM] Joe: I know she was asking people about if they send pictures of their cock and later if the women sent pictures of their pussy. And I understand some of the responses but most of the time I’m lost haha
"
5472,"[7/7/20, 1:10:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha 🤷‍♂️
"
5473,"[7/7/20, 1:12:58 PM] Joe: Hmmmm let me think 🤔 . There isn’t as many ways in English haha.
"
5474,"[7/7/20, 1:14:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha

5475,"‎[7/7/20, 1:15:49 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
"
5476,"[7/7/20, 1:16:34 PM] Joe: Hahaha sorry there aren’t many. I mean, there are a lot of slang words for them that no one uses
"
5477,"[7/7/20, 1:18:13 PM] Joe: Haha I was wondering what you would think of the girls answers 😂
"
5478,"[7/7/20, 1:18:46 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be nice if everyone could just be honest without feeling super judged.
"
5479,"[7/7/20, 1:23:40 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that was good. You had the last one right. “Coochie” haha
"
5480,"[7/7/20, 1:31:57 PM] Joe: I listened to this so many times 😂 but yeah that’s crazy stuff like that is still going on. Poor education or bad parenting, who knows but hopefully the world is moving in the right direction over time
"
5481,"[7/7/20, 1:32:51 PM] Joe: You look good to me as usual
"
5482,"[7/7/20, 1:47:49 PM] Joe: Lonely Lore haha. How long are they gone for?
"
5483,"[7/7/20, 1:48:53 PM] Joe: Oh yeah after the 1000th time listening I understood the situation. Super messed up what he did!
"
5484,"[7/7/20, 1:50:10 PM] Joe: They made a law here in the states that would classify what he did as “revenge porn” since he posted nudes cause that kind of stuff was a huge problem. Now you can go to jail for doing stuff like that.
"
5485,"[7/7/20, 1:52:44 PM] Joe: Oh damn so you’re alone for a few days then. Well....with only Rogel haha
"
5486,"[7/7/20, 1:54:07 PM] Joe: Holy shit, gnarly. Yeah I think it is a good law. Especially with how people send those kind of pictures or videos to each other nowadays. Very common.
"
5487,"[7/7/20, 1:54:21 PM] Joe: Shit....you even got me to send a video 😬
"
5488,"[7/7/20, 1:55:38 PM] Joe: The protection is needed though. So many people do messed up stuff like share those pictures or videos when they get upset or breakup with a person. Or they send it to a friend and it spreads fast. Either way, people are messed up sometimes
"
5489,"[7/7/20, 1:56:04 PM] Joe: I have all the trust in the world for you
"
5490,"[7/7/20, 2:01:53 PM] Joe: I hope you are never in that situation but I feel like you would handle it well and the boy would end up regretting his decision
"
5491,"[7/7/20, 2:02:37 PM] Joe: What you send to me is for my eyes only! I’d never show anyone haha
"
5492,"‎[7/7/20, 2:10:17 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
"
5493,"[7/7/20, 2:11:59 PM] Joe: Hahah I don’t knoooow 😂 now? Or whenever you send me more sexy stuff haha you get me “worked up”
"
5494,"[7/7/20, 2:14:22 PM] Joe: Hahah I am not sexy like you though 😂
"
5495,"[7/7/20, 2:17:17 PM] Joe: It’s easier when you make a request haha. I don’t even know what is sexy to you hahah. Fuck I’m the worst 🤦‍♂️
"
5496,"[7/7/20, 2:18:45 PM] Joe: Hahahahahaha
"
5497,"[7/7/20, 2:18:55 PM] Joe: 💩
"
5498,"[7/7/20, 2:25:47 PM] Joe: Aaaah haha gross 😝
"
5499,"[7/7/20, 2:26:02 PM] Joe: Rogel with his little poopoo butt hahaha

"
5504,"[7/7/20, 2:37:49 PM] Joe: cause i do
"
5505,"[7/7/20, 2:47:08 PM] Joe: Haha I’m easily provoked by you. I’m really sorry. Half of it is me being shy and not knowing what to even send you. And the other half is the schedule. I’m hornier in the morning and evening I guess 🤷‍♂️
"
5506,"[7/7/20, 2:47:49 PM] Joe: Ejsoixdjeis I feel like I disappoint you haha fuck 🤦‍♂️
"
5507,"[7/7/20, 2:53:44 PM] Joe: I can’t lie, morning sex is kind of my favorite 🙊🙈
"
5508,"[7/7/20, 2:55:02 PM] Joe: Haha it’s just a little more work to get in the mood in the middle of the day 😆 plus I get so sleepy afterwards hahaha
"
5509,"[7/7/20, 2:55:50 PM] Joe: Yeah I know what you mean
"
5510,"[7/7/20, 3:07:33 PM] Joe: Today is alright. Nothing special haha. The guy never got back to me. Disappeared 😡
"
5511,"[7/7/20, 3:08:53 PM] Joe: And when the hell is Spain going to start letting US citizens visit!? Right now it’s no go. I think they do another update in a week or so
"
5512,"[7/7/20, 3:09:18 PM] Joe: I just want to buy my ticket and go see you
"
5513,"[7/7/20, 3:15:58 PM] Joe: This sucks
"
5514,"[7/7/20, 3:16:01 PM] Joe: We’ll have to meet in Costa Rica haha
"
5515,"[7/7/20, 3:18:04 PM] Joe: Even if everything goes to shit and we can’t be together I’ll visit you someday. Even if it’s far in the future and we can only be friends I would still love to visit you. But that’s not what I want. I want to see you sooner rather than later haha
"
5516,"[7/7/20, 3:18:46 PM] Joe: I’m trying to do all I can to get to you but the situation of the world is fucked. I have one goal right now haha get to Spain to see you
"
5517,"[7/7/20, 3:29:57 PM] Joe: I really really don’t want to just be friends. I just don’t want to keep you waiting for too long haha it’s hard to explain. 
"
5518,"[7/7/20, 3:32:29 PM] Joe: You’re right. It’ll happen eventually! But It feels like it has been so long already that we’ve been talking. I just really want to go to you now haha the ultimate test of patience 😂
"
5519,"[7/8/20, 1:01:39 AM] Joe: All good. I was sleeping well until my aunt from Hawaii arrived haha. My dad just picked her up from the airport. They’re in the other room talking hellaaaa loud!

5527,"[7/8/20, 1:20:59 AM] Joe: Damn you’re the best haha sounds good to me. I’ll keep checking the status of travel until they’ll let me come see you haha
"
5528,"[7/8/20, 1:21:16 AM] Joe: They can’t stop us forever 😂
"
5529,"[7/8/20, 1:26:53 AM] Joe: Hahaha this is me when someone says I’m not allowed to travel to Spain
"
5530,"[7/8/20, 1:28:16 AM] Joe: Thaaaanks. Yeah I’m trying haha

"
5533,"[7/8/20, 1:35:19 AM] Joe: Oh god dammit what the hell people!
"
5534,"[7/8/20, 1:36:36 AM] Joe: It’s so hard to get so many humans to work towards a single goal. This virus stuff needs to be over. Ugh this is ridiculous

"
5537,"[7/8/20, 1:41:21 AM] Joe: It makes me wonder if they are just wearing it to be technically following the rules, but they really don’t want to wear it. Or if they’re just not very educated and don’t know what they’re doing. I guess the answer could be a little of both haha
"
5538,"[7/8/20, 1:48:03 AM] Joe: Yeah I have a lot of family that works in hospitals so I don’t appreciate people’s negligence haha
"
5539,"[7/8/20, 1:48:52 AM] Joe: And I really want to have my own business one day. It’s super difficult as it is. I can’t imagine having something I worked hard to build get crushed because of something completely out of my control
"
5540,"[7/8/20, 1:50:59 AM] Joe: My family has been pretty good about staying home. And no one really visits my grandparents right now cause they’re scared to get them sick
"
5541,"[7/8/20, 1:51:55 AM] Joe: I don’t know. But I don’t like working for other people and I feel like I can find someway to create value in the world
"
5542,"[7/8/20, 1:53:48 AM] Joe: Mmm well technically I already started a business. I have one for my freelance coding stuff.
"
5543,"[7/8/20, 1:54:54 AM] Joe: But yeah other than that, maybe a store, online and/or in real life, not sure. But I don’t know what I would sell haha.
"
5544,"[7/8/20, 1:55:52 AM] Joe: Hahah I know I’m terrible 😆
"
5545,"[7/8/20, 1:57:13 AM] Joe: Haha true. We’ll see.
"
5546,"[7/8/20, 1:58:04 AM] Joe: I wish I had a better idea of what business I want to create but it’s pretty hard to come up with a solid business plan for a lot of ideas haha

"
5549,"[7/8/20, 2:03:07 AM] Joe: Alright babe everyone finally went to bed so I can sleep now. I’m glad we got to talk a little extra today though haha
"
5550,"[7/8/20, 2:04:59 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s true. It would be nice to work where most people are already happy 😆
"
5551,"[7/8/20, 2:05:12 AM] Joe: Ok I’m going to sleeeeep now 😴

5556,"[7/8/20, 12:06:04 PM] Joe: Hahah just the ones that actually like skateboarding. The ones that don’t want to be there probably hate me 😂
"
5557,"[7/8/20, 12:19:49 PM] Joe: Happens all the time haha. Parents have to go to work and just pick a camp they think the kid will like
"
5558,"[7/8/20, 12:20:44 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m a man child 😂

5560,"[7/8/20, 12:22:52 PM] Joe: Today was pretty fun though. I got an offer to teach a couple of kids private lessons next week. 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. Should make up for not getting that other job a little bit haha
"
5561,"[7/8/20, 12:30:24 PM] Joe: Haha same when I’m a dad. I don’t think it’s on purpose. The parents and even the kids might think they’ll like it but when they find out how hard it is and how much they get hurt some lose interest
"
5562,"[7/8/20, 12:31:34 PM] Joe: It’s two kids that are in camp this week. Honestly they’re some of my least favorite kids haha but the parents are paying good
"
5563,"[7/8/20, 12:39:55 PM] Joe: Hahahah this kid is so stoked!
"
5564,"[7/8/20, 12:40:03 PM] Joe: “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida!!” Hahahah
"
5565,"[7/8/20, 12:43:09 PM] Joe: The gasp at 1 min 30 sec Hahahaha
"
5566,"[7/8/20, 12:47:47 PM] Joe: He got so many gifts haha. He was so excited about the colors and book haha and I don’t know what it was after the chocolate but he was hella happy about whatever it was
"
5567,"[7/8/20, 1:02:32 PM] Joe: Haha that’s definitely a video you can watch to help get in a better mood. How can you stay mad watching that little dude be so happy?? Haha impossible
"
5568,"[7/8/20, 2:38:27 PM] Joe: Dookie died last night. I just found out 😢
"
5569,"[7/8/20, 3:13:42 PM] Joe: I don’t know. He hasn’t been eating much lately and didn’t seem well. My dad found him upstairs this morning
"
5570,"[7/8/20, 3:14:02 PM] Joe: We’re going to bury him in the backyard now
"
5571,"[7/8/20, 3:15:36 PM] Joe: Poor little Dookie 😔
"
5572,"[7/8/20, 4:01:21 PM] Joe: Thanks babe
"
5573,"[7/8/20, 5:10:31 PM] Joe: We’re good. It’s just me and my dad here. My mom went with my aunt up north to see my cousin. We had dookie for almost 10 years. He was definitely a part of the family.
"
5574,"[7/8/20, 5:11:10 PM] Joe: ‎You deleted this message.
"
5575,"[7/8/20, 5:12:31 PM] Joe: So weird though. I totally didn’t think he was going to die
"
5576,"[7/8/20, 5:41:02 PM] Joe: I really appreciate you. Thanks a lot. It sucks but that’s life. There is always an end 😔
"
5577,"[7/9/20, 6:14:37 AM] Joe: Buenos días. I fell asleep pretty early last night.

"
5581,"[7/9/20, 11:45:16 AM] Joe: Hahah yeah the one that looks like Shelby. He is ok. Just had a cut under his eye. Could’ve been worse I guess
"

5586,"[7/9/20, 12:17:09 PM] Joe: Voy a cubrir unas horas en el parque. Así que estoy aquí por 3 horas más para monitorear
"
5587,"[7/9/20, 12:19:19 PM] Joe: Aaaaah ok ok
"
5588,"[7/9/20, 12:52:35 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
"
5589,"[7/9/20, 12:53:19 PM] Joe: 😂
"
5590,"[7/9/20, 12:53:38 PM] Joe: Good. I’m just sitting in the shade right now keeping an eye on the park
"
5591,"[7/9/20, 12:53:49 PM] Joe: Easy work
"
5592,"[7/9/20, 1:17:49 PM] Joe: Haha that’s a relief 😅
"
5593,"[7/9/20, 1:18:48 PM] Joe: I think I like working at the skatepark too much hahah all I do is skate around or sit all day haha. I used to use them time to learn stuff when they’d let me sit in the building but now i have to be in the park or at the front all the time
"
5594,"[7/9/20, 1:36:40 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. Getting paid to skate is awesome. The only time it’s not fun is when a parent gets mad when I tell them their kid can’t ride a scooter or bike at the park haha
"
5595,"[7/9/20, 1:37:25 PM] Joe: Some people get so upset when I tell them no but I’m just doing my job 🤷‍♂️
"
5596,"[7/9/20, 1:42:56 PM] Joe: Mmmm 4 years now
"
5597,"[7/9/20, 1:43:40 PM] Joe: Well I’ve been working 4 years at the skatepark but I’ve only done 3 years of lessons. The first year I just did monitoring of the park
"
5598,"[7/9/20, 1:59:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah and every time I leave I tell them not to fire me so I can work next summer if I come back.
"
5599,"[7/9/20, 2:59:47 PM] Joe: Some lady just asked me to tutor her kid 😂 like not in skateboarding but actually tutor them for school haha. Weird
"
5600,"[7/9/20, 3:47:13 PM] Joe: Hahahah whaaaat??
"
5601,"[7/9/20, 3:49:40 PM] Joe: The kids mom talked to me today while I was monitoring the park and asked if I would be interested in tutoring her son. He isn’t in camp or anything. I’ve seen that kid at the park a few times and his mom knows that he likes me so she thought it would be easier for me to teach him his school stuff instead of her 😂
"
5602,"[7/9/20, 3:56:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha you look hella sleepy
"
5603,"[7/9/20, 3:59:31 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look beautiful as always!
"
5604,"[7/9/20, 4:00:24 PM] Joe: I am a little worried about how much work teaching actual school work is going to be haha
"
5605,"[7/9/20, 4:00:55 PM] Joe: But I’m willing to try it out and see how it goes. We’ll do like 25 minutes of school then take a skateboard break and repeat haha
"
5606,"‎[7/9/20, 4:04:09 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
"
5607,"[7/9/20, 4:06:47 PM] Joe: No this would be a new thing. The mom just asked me this today and got my phone number. The kid is not a part of camp. It would probably be in the afternoon after I’m done working camp
"
5608,"[7/9/20, 4:11:47 PM] Joe: Ooh haha sorry. I’m worried because teaching school work isn’t the same as teaching skateboarding. Or maybe it is? I don’t know haha.
"
5609,"[7/9/20, 4:12:51 PM] Joe: I just don’t want to do a bad job and it would be my first time doing something like that
"
5610,"[7/9/20, 4:14:51 PM] Joe: Yeah she wants me to help him study and do school work. With skateboarding breaks in between.
"
5611,"[7/9/20, 4:15:16 PM] Joe: She said she was having a hard time getting him interested in learning anything for school during quarantine
"
5612,"[7/9/20, 4:15:46 PM] Joe: Actually she said “I tried to teach him for the first 2 months of quarantine and we almost killed each other” 😬
"
5613,"[7/9/20, 4:16:40 PM] Joe: He is in 1st grade so everything I have to teach him is supposed to be easy
"
5614,"[7/9/20, 4:17:02 PM] Joe: Not sure how old first grade is. 6 or 7 maybe?
"
5615,"[7/9/20, 4:19:13 PM] Joe: Yeah she sounded like she needed help haha. But also she is a white lady and her kid is brown and she was like “I think it would be good for an older boy to help him. Especially someone that looks like him. And he seems to have gravitated towards you”. 
"
5616,"[7/9/20, 4:20:17 PM] Joe: We’re going to schedule something when I’m not working the skatepark. I don’t think we’ll be at the skatepark when I teach him either. Probably just going to skate near his house
"
5617,"[7/9/20, 4:21:52 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s what it is. I mean we also do “kindergarten” but that’s more like daycare disguised as school for 5 year olds haha
"
5618,"[7/9/20, 4:25:47 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully. I’ll let you know how it goes. She might not even contact me 🤷‍♂️
"
5619,"[7/9/20, 4:27:19 PM] Joe: She’ll flake like the other guy haha and the only ones who will be true to their word is the 2 little devils I’m supposed to give skate lessons to hahaha I’m really thinking about cancelling those lessons. Those kids are not pleasant 😂

"
5631,"[7/9/20, 11:13:28 PM] Joe: I worked at the park from 8:30-3 then I came home and did some coding. Took a nap. Ate food. Went to my friends house. I think that was it 🤔
"
5632,"[7/9/20, 11:18:20 PM] Joe: Yeah I have a lot of time during the day. I need to start building a new website or something to fill the time. I’ve just been doing “coding challenges” where you try to solve the problem given to you.
"
5633,"[7/9/20, 11:19:26 PM] Joe: But right now I’m super sleepy haha. I’m going to bed now 😴

"
5678,"[7/10/20, 4:01:10 PM] Joe: Yeah I just don’t really like to post stuff I guess. I’ll just keep the photos and videos for myself. I share them you instead haha
"
5679,"[7/10/20, 4:09:31 PM] Joe: Hahah I send so much of me doing absolutely nothing. Or hanging out with the dogs. I never know what to send you but I want you to see me. I’ve sent a lot of stuff but I’m going to keep sending things until you tell me to stop haha
"
5680,"[7/10/20, 4:19:58 PM] Joe: I send them when I can haha I’ve been trying to remember to do it more often. I also want to send more of me practicing Spanish.

5681,"[7/11/20, 6:33:47 AM] Joe: Buenos díasss
"
5682,"[7/11/20, 6:34:40 AM] Joe: I almost forgot I picked up some more short shifts this weekend. I have to monitor the park 7:45-12 today and tomorrow.
"
5683,"[7/11/20, 7:00:26 AM] Joe: Haha yeah it’s not bad. Plus my friends like to sleep in so they’ll barely be ready for the day when I’m getting off work.
"
5684,"[7/11/20, 7:00:49 AM] Joe: Hurray! What’s the plan for the rest of your day?
"
5685,"[7/11/20, 7:08:51 AM] Joe: I’m not doing any partying 🤷‍♂️ i go to my close friends houses and chill but that’s about it. 
"
5686,"[7/11/20, 7:09:04 AM] Joe: Haha of course. Have fun!
"
5687,"[7/11/20, 7:09:56 AM] Joe: Damn that’s hella cheap haha. Good find. Send pictures later 😆
"
5688,"[7/11/20, 7:10:47 AM] Joe: Oh yeah everyone has to clear that inventory that’s been sitting. Time for good deals. I’m sure you’ll find some great stuff

5690,"[7/11/20, 7:13:13 AM] Joe: Haha alright babe I have to get on the road now! I’ll message you when I’m bored at work but I’ll be driving for a little while. I’ll talk to you soooon
"
5691,"[7/11/20, 7:16:12 AM] Joe: Hahaha that sounded bad.sorry hahah
"
5692,"[7/11/20, 7:16:21 AM] Joe: Not just when I’m bored 😂
"
5693,"[7/11/20, 7:16:39 AM] Joe: Ok I miss you I’ll talk to you super soon 😘

5695,"[7/11/20, 8:08:58 AM] Joe: Hahaha I’m getting a little dark being out here everyday 😂
"
5696,"[7/11/20, 8:09:31 AM] Joe: It’s super nice. Except I burned my tongue with my coffee hahah shit
"
5697,"[7/11/20, 8:33:31 AM] Joe: Mmmmm I want some 😋
"
5698,"[7/11/20, 8:48:46 AM] Joe: I usually get regular glazed doughnuts or doughnut holes haha
"
5699,"[7/11/20, 8:48:50 AM] Joe: Super plain
"
5700,"[7/11/20, 9:01:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha we do like our doughnuts. It’s weirdly considered a breakfast food here 😂
"
5701,"[7/11/20, 9:02:12 AM] Joe: Hahah spanish way of spelling it makes more sense.
"
5702,"[7/11/20, 10:01:41 AM] Joe: Haha noooo. Usually eggs and avocados or something like that.
"
5703,"[7/11/20, 10:02:38 AM] Joe: Doughnuts are too sweet for me to eat for breakfast most of the time. I was definitely eating a lot of pancakes when I was staying with my sister but haven’t had any since I came back to California
"
5704,"[7/11/20, 10:25:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha I eat relatively healthy....for an American 😂
"
5705,"[7/11/20, 11:11:07 AM] Joe: I actually just watched a video recently about Americans weird sugary breakfasts. We eat super sweet and/or heavy breakfast compared to the rest of the world. The pictures of breakfast you send me always look super light and healthy compared to what is typical here
"
5706,"[7/11/20, 11:51:18 AM] Joe: Hahahah you’re the fucking best!
"
5707,"[7/11/20, 11:53:41 AM] Joe: I got to leave a few minutes early. Time for some food! I only had a coffee this morning.
"
5708,"[7/11/20, 12:07:07 PM] Joe: Haha I think I told you before. I’m good at following recipes 😂
"
5709,"[7/11/20, 12:07:27 PM] Joe: FUCK

"
5711,"[7/11/20, 12:16:24 PM] Joe: The number is getting big. I was looking at the way the 1918 spanish flu worked out. Took 2 to 3 years before the infection rate went way down. This could take a while
"
5712,"[7/11/20, 12:16:38 PM] Joe: So shitty haha
"
5713,"[7/11/20, 12:32:28 PM] Joe: Damn that would suuuuck. It seems like a possibility though. I really hope this doesn’t last that long.
"
5714,"[7/11/20, 12:32:40 PM] Joe: 2 years of this madness is too much haha
"
5715,"[7/11/20, 12:37:05 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. But I’m already going to remember this forever
"
5716,"[7/11/20, 12:37:38 PM] Joe: Hopefully we aren’t in two countries that are going to go to shit haha
"
5717,"[7/11/20, 12:38:37 PM] Joe: Whoops haha I totally said the same thing before I read this. But we might be in two of the worst countries right now 😂
"
5718,"[7/11/20, 12:50:55 PM] Joe: Haha I better be with you by November! I was hoping I’d get there before your birthday haha
"

5722,"[7/11/20, 12:57:34 PM] Joe: I have no idea haha. They really didn’t give me a good timeframe. Just said it would be delayed. Usually it’s 6-8 weeks I believe but that’s without the delay 😬
"
5723,"[7/11/20, 12:59:18 PM] Joe: I can’t wait to hear you say, “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida” ahahaha
"
5724,"[7/11/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s right.
"
5725,"[7/11/20, 1:00:41 PM] Joe: I probably did the appointment before camp started so that was at least 4 weeks ago
"
5726,"[7/11/20, 1:01:06 PM] Joe: Damn it must be coming soon

"
5730,"[7/11/20, 3:16:41 PM] Joe: Haha cute picture. Kenya loves to cuddle you so much. You look super pretty too. With a glow around your head haha
"
5731,"[7/11/20, 3:17:49 PM] Joe: Super cute haha 🥰
"
5732,"[7/11/20, 3:20:05 PM] Joe: Well I really like that picture haha it’s a good one
"
5733,"[7/11/20, 3:20:35 PM] Joe: She doesn’t want you to go anywhere Haha

5742,"[7/11/20, 3:40:45 PM] Joe: She brings you in like quicksand haha

"
5744,"[7/11/20, 3:41:35 PM] Joe: It’s like a photo shoot haha
"
5745,"[7/11/20, 3:49:45 PM] Joe: Hahaha now I want to be Kenya like how you wanted to be socks the other day 😂
"
5746,"[7/11/20, 3:50:07 PM] Joe: Looks comfy
"
5747,"[7/11/20, 4:04:05 PM] Joe: Hahah I would be so tempted to just cuddle with at least one of you all the time 😂
"
5748,"[7/11/20, 4:04:54 PM] Joe: Super unproductive hahaha but soooo great haha
"
5749,"[7/11/20, 4:11:37 PM] Joe: Whenever that’s an option I choose you every time haha no doubt
"
5750,"[7/11/20, 4:14:14 PM] Joe: Damn that sucks. Poor brother. It sucks that she tries to leave instead of working it out. Not a great sign haha
"
5751,"[7/11/20, 4:14:44 PM] Joe: 😂
"
5752,"[7/11/20, 4:15:06 PM] Joe: Yessss haha
"
5753,"[7/11/20, 4:15:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha 😆
"
5754,"[7/11/20, 4:16:30 PM] Joe: I mean sometimes people need time before they want to talk about something. But I don’t now the situation so I don’t want to speculate 😂
"
5755,"[7/11/20, 4:18:07 PM] Joe: Aaah that’s a tough situation. Working hard, being tired, stress from COVID stuff. Not a great combination
"
5756,"[7/11/20, 4:20:44 PM] Joe: If we have a fight I’ll have to send you messages or write you a letter cause I won’t know how to express myself well enough haha shit
"
5757,"[7/11/20, 4:22:41 PM] Joe: Yeah i guess it sounds like Gastón could do a little more. Or at least seem more concerned? But I’m sure he is tired as well which makes it hard
"
5758,"[7/11/20, 4:26:30 PM] Joe: I think we would be able to resolve most things for sure haha
"
5759,"[7/11/20, 4:27:20 PM] Joe: 😬😬 yeaah that's tough. Sounds like a response that someone with a lot of stress would give
"
5760,"[7/11/20, 4:28:36 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. Yeah i've noticed you care quite a bit, especially for having never met me 😂
"
5761,"[7/11/20, 5:10:23 PM] Joe: Hahah
"
5762,"[7/11/20, 5:10:35 PM] Joe: i almost fell asleep 😂 I need to take a nap
"
5763,"[7/11/20, 11:17:29 PM] Joe: Hahah Kenya is such a sleepy dog. I swear most of the videos you send with Kenya are of her cuddling and sleeping on you 😂
"
5764,"[7/11/20, 11:18:32 PM] Joe: I ended up taking that nap. Now I feel like that meme of the kangaroo I sent you haha. It was supposed to be a 30 minute nap and I slept for 5 hours haha
"
5765,"[7/11/20, 11:24:14 PM] Joe: Hahah now I don’t know what to do. I’m not very tired but i also am supposed to wake up early. I guess I’ll try to go back to sleep in an hour or two.

"
5769,"[7/11/20, 11:32:50 PM] Joe: I had just eaten a bunch of food and it was super hot. I got so sleepy haha. Oh well it happens 🤷‍♂️
"
5770,"[7/11/20, 11:48:32 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s what I felt like.
"
5771,"[7/11/20, 11:49:01 PM] Joe: I actually slept on the floor cause it was too hot in my bed. I didn’t think I’d be asleep for so long so sleeping on the floor seemed like a good idea.
"
5772,"[7/11/20, 11:57:18 PM] Joe: The floor was carpet but I was laying on a towel. Pretty comfortable actually
"
5773,"[7/11/20, 11:57:34 PM] Joe: Maybe a little too comfortable apparently 😆
"
5774,"[7/12/20, 12:11:28 AM] Joe: Interesting. I didn’t realize having a lot of carpet is kind of an American thing. Americans must be a strange bunch to the rest of the world haha
"
5775,"[7/12/20, 12:29:50 AM] Joe: Now i am just wondering what other things seem common to me but are actually not super common haha. Like how we have mostly automatic gears in our cars. I didn’t realize automatics are less common in other places
"
5776,"[7/12/20, 12:31:30 AM] Joe: We’re actually taking out a lot of the carpet and putting in hardwood floors. Carpet is nice but it is difficult to keep it looking nice for years
"

"
5843,"[7/12/20, 2:54:41 PM] Joe: This is a different car haha we got to drive the other one already but we didn’t get to do much drifting. It was already getting dark when we got to the spot that day we fixed it. Now he is trying to get this one ready for an event on Wednesday
"
5844,"[7/12/20, 3:04:07 PM] Joe: He has too many cars haha and they all need work 😂
"
5845,"[7/12/20, 3:04:34 PM] Joe: I always tell him that he should just have 1 nice car instead of 3 or 4 shitty ones

"
5849,"[7/12/20, 3:15:48 PM] Joe: Homeless 😂

5852,"[7/12/20, 3:19:42 PM] Joe: Well she explained that he dog doesn’t like people that are afraid of it.
"
5853,"[7/12/20, 3:20:26 PM] Joe: I asked one of my friends and he said that dog is like a guard dog in China often. It’s seen as an aggressive breed to many, like how Americans see pit bulls as aggressive.

5854,"[7/12/20, 3:21:29 PM] Joe: But, she hella pulled the dog away when my Asian homie came up even though he wasn’t afraid of the dog haha so that made me question that lady and how she is training the dog
"
5855,"[7/12/20, 3:24:17 PM] Joe: Woooah! It wasn’t as big as that huge one but it was just as fluffy looking
"
5856,"[7/12/20, 3:24:42 PM] Joe: Actually it was probably pretty close in size to that dog. Just a tiny bit smaller
"
5857,"[7/12/20, 3:27:01 PM] Joe: He had a big giant eye booger hahah but he was cool. The owner was surprised he liked me and had to take a picture for the trainer 😂
"
5858,"[7/13/20, 6:32:09 AM] Joe: Hola I hope you’re having a good day at work. I don’t want to get up hahah

"
5904,"[7/13/20, 1:52:16 PM] Joe: I refer to a lot of alcohol as juice though. Like I will call it skate juice if we drink while skating, even if it’s beer. It’s just something me and my friends say a lot when referring to alcohol 😂

5927,"[7/13/20, 3:33:06 PM] Joe: I just need underwear that keep my balls safe and are comfortable to move around in. I don’t put too much thought into it when I buy them haha
"
5928,"[7/13/20, 3:40:49 PM] Joe: 🤔 I mean, I like all the things you’ve been wearing in the videos you send so far. Very sexy. I guess as long as you aren’t wearing grandma underwear it’s all good haha.

"
5988,"[7/15/20, 7:31:14 AM] Joe: This is probably weird for me to say but I was hella wanting my own little baby yesterday 😂

"
5992,"[7/15/20, 7:36:38 AM] Joe: The funny thing is, my friends that have kids are the super irresponsible friends haha. The friends that we guessed would’ve been the last to have kids had kids first haha
"
5993,"[7/15/20, 7:37:40 AM] Joe: I don’t want to take care of everyone else’s kids haha I want to make my own kids cool
"
5994,"[7/15/20, 7:41:30 AM] Joe: I guess it makes sense. They had the kids on accident which matches their irresponsible personalities hahaa
"
5995,"[7/15/20, 7:44:12 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I thought it would be weird to tell you but that’s what I’ve been feeling lately. Probably from just being around kids so much and trying to help them learn.
"
5996,"[7/15/20, 7:45:39 AM] Joe: I don’t know. Am I supposed to want other things at this age? I feel like I want to be a dad 😂

5998,"[7/15/20, 7:50:42 AM] Joe: Haha that makes sense. What would you say is a typical age to have kids in Spain?
"
5999,"[7/15/20, 7:52:28 AM] Joe: Hmmm I don’t know if I would adopt. Maybe if that was my only option haha I wouldn’t be totally against it. If I knew I’d never have a kid I’d probably adopt at that point
"
6000,"[7/15/20, 7:53:05 AM] Joe: Damn that’s pretty late haha. Everyone in Spain has old ass parents 😆
"
6001,"[7/15/20, 7:54:21 AM] Joe: Haha yeah it would be my preference to have my own. Little mini me hahaha
"
6002,"[7/15/20, 7:55:54 AM] Joe: My friend’s son looks hella like me. Super similar hair and everything. Seeing that little dude hella makes me want my own little dude haha
"
6003,"[7/15/20, 7:58:03 AM] Joe: They came after it got dark. I sent a Instagram post with his kids
"
6004,"[7/15/20, 8:01:31 AM] Joe: I want a little one 😩
"
6005,"[7/15/20, 8:02:02 AM] Joe: Ok ok I’m sorry enough of that. I’ll get over it hahaha. Alright babe I have to go to work now. I hope you have a wonderful day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
"
6006,"[7/15/20, 8:03:39 AM] Joe: Fuck. Too cute haha
"
6007,"[7/15/20, 8:03:45 AM] Joe: 😂
"
6008,"[7/15/20, 8:06:42 AM] Joe: 😩
"
6009,"[7/15/20, 12:00:16 PM] Joe: It’s going well. Just waiting for the last 2 kids to get picked up and I can get some lunch before starting the private lesson
"
6010,"[7/15/20, 12:13:53 PM] Joe: The private lesson wasn’t actually that bad. The kids were better behaved compared to when they were at camp. I think it’s because the park had a lot of adults skating so they weren’t as comfortable.
"
6011,"[7/15/20, 12:19:07 PM] Joe: The private lesson for today starts at 1. Yesterday’s lesson went well
"
6012,"[7/15/20, 12:21:00 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s not so bad. We’ll see how many weeks I continue doing these lessons for. I have some other people trying to get lessons too. Going to start a bidding war haha
"
6013,"[7/15/20, 12:24:03 PM] Joe: Actually I’ve been thinking I need to increase my prices for private lessons. I have a friend that does them and he charges almost twice what I charge haha
"
6014,"[7/15/20, 12:28:12 PM] Joe: Yeah I charge about that much. $30-40 per hour. But my friend charges $60+ per hour and has no trouble getting lessons
"
6015,"[7/15/20, 12:31:02 PM] Joe: Yeah he also teaches children. He is probably about the same level of skating as me.
"
6016,"[7/15/20, 12:31:31 PM] Joe: Nothing. He just asked for that much. Parents have a lot of money around here haha
"
6017,"[7/15/20, 12:31:48 PM] Joe: Have you seen Orange Is The New Black on Netflix?
"
6018,"[7/15/20, 12:32:32 PM] Joe: One of the kids that I’m giving private lessons to said his mom wrote the book and sold it to Netflix. So I’m assuming his mom is the main character and also very rich hahaa
"
6019,"[7/15/20, 12:33:33 PM] Joe: Oh yeah for sure haha. I’m getting $70 hour but I have to watch 2 kids haha. That should be the price for just 1
"
6020,"[7/15/20, 12:39:12 PM] Joe: I think 60 and 50 for two is probably reasonable.
"
6021,"[7/15/20, 12:40:37 PM] Joe: That’s probably true. I know one guy that would charge $100 per hour. He was really good instructor but very expensive
"
6022,"[7/15/20, 12:45:48 PM] Joe: I guess it depends on the goal. If the parents basically want a babysitter $100 is too much. But if they’re actually trying to get their kid to the next level and progress it’s not super unreasonable. It doesn’t take a crazy amount of hours to get a lot of improvement so it seems worth it.

6023,"[7/15/20, 12:46:55 PM] Joe: The parents of these kids seem like they want a babysitter and it’s just a bonus that I can skate with the kids while doing it haha.

"
6029,"[7/16/20, 6:42:19 AM] Joe: The mountains are such a constant feature in the background here that I sometimes don’t even notice them anymore. But when I go somewhere without mountains i definitely notice they’re missing haha

"
6033,"[7/16/20, 12:15:28 PM] Joe: Yeah those two kids are not so bad.
"
6034,"[7/16/20, 12:16:26 PM] Joe: Time for a short break before the lessons start. I’m getting tired.

"
6043,"[7/16/20, 1:55:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha I like the hat 😂
"
6044,"[7/16/20, 1:55:50 PM] Joe: I was going to say it looks like a fishing hat haha
"
6045,"[7/16/20, 2:14:33 PM] Joe: Hahah dude I was just thinking I need to start bringing a hat 🧢
"
6046,"[7/16/20, 2:15:03 PM] Joe: You look great in the hat hahah wear it wherever you want

"
6050,"[7/16/20, 3:08:42 PM] Joe: I’m finally free! No lessons after work tomorrow so it’ll be an easy short day
"
6051,"[7/16/20, 3:26:40 PM] Joe: Shit I’m going to be an ugly old man 👴🏽
"
6052,"[7/16/20, 3:26:49 PM] Joe: I better get some sunscreen hahaha
"
6053,"[7/16/20, 3:37:48 PM] Joe: Damn I always get free when you go to bed lately. Alright babe, sleep well. Talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘

6055,"[7/16/20, 10:23:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you should definitely do that some day haha. I love going out when there is very few people out. It’s especially interesting in bigger cities that you usually see very full. Completely different vibe haha
"
6056,"[7/16/20, 10:28:37 PM] Joe: Haha that’s also true. Well I hope you have a good day at work. You’ll probably be getting off around the time I wake up 🙄
"
6057,"[7/16/20, 10:29:22 PM] Joe: hahaha Is this where we meet?
"
6058,"[7/16/20, 10:32:41 PM] Joe: Sounds like a plan haha I’d be super stoked to get back to island life haha 🌴
"
6059,"[7/16/20, 10:34:12 PM] Joe: It would be great if my passport would show up. And if they would open up travel 😑
"
6060,"[7/16/20, 10:41:32 PM] Joe: A lot of people knowing English would be great. I still need to know my spanish for you though haha most important.
"
6061,"[7/16/20, 10:42:35 PM] Joe: Oh yeah things are closing again in some states. Cases are going up. They’re considering whether or not to open schools after summer.
"
6062,"[7/16/20, 10:43:46 PM] Joe: I think in the city I work they decided they’ll do 8 weeks of online classes at least to start the school year.
"
6063,"[7/16/20, 10:52:38 PM] Joe: Shiiiiit
"
6064,"[7/16/20, 10:54:00 PM] Joe: For real! Fuck. This is some ridiculous shit. If I was just “allowed” to go, I’d be there so soon.

"
6070,"[7/16/20, 10:59:00 PM] Joe: I appreciate it. I’m still going. I still tell people I’m trying to get to Spain when they ask when I’m going back to Hawaii haha
"
6071,"[7/16/20, 11:00:17 PM] Joe: I know you said you won’t stop talking to me...but if for some reason this went on for years and you actually did stop talking to me, I’d still go to Spain the first chance I get hahaa. I can’t not go
"
6072,"[7/16/20, 11:01:10 PM] Joe: No I’m not going back to Hawaii. I’m going to you haha.
"
6073,"[7/16/20, 11:01:38 PM] Joe: It better not be years. It was an extreme hypothetical situation haha
"
6074,"[7/16/20, 11:02:47 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m just saying. I’m going to Spain no matter what. I need to go at this point 😆
"
6075,"[7/16/20, 11:04:40 PM] Joe: Haha well besides seeing you, which is what I really want...I’ve also grown super fond of the idea of going to a country and learning more spanish. But like you said, it would be good for me to learn with you 😊
"
6076,"[7/16/20, 11:06:20 PM] Joe: Yesss haha you should definitely do that. We’ll see who can get to the other fastest. Though I’m pretty sure I’ll win this race haha

"
6080,"[7/16/20, 11:22:18 PM] Joe: Alright you tell me what huequitos is when you can. I’m going to fall asleep any second haha have a great day, I’ll talk to you soon! Buenas noches 😘
"
6081,"[7/17/20, 6:34:33 AM] Joe: Niiice. But do you wish to start early too haha?
"
6082,"[7/17/20, 6:35:15 AM] Joe: All gooood. I went to sleep soon after messaging you
"
6083,"[7/17/20, 6:36:07 AM] Joe: Hahah ok I understand hueco now 😂 thank you. I have to get up and take a shower now.
"
6084,"[7/17/20, 7:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess getting off early is pretty great. I used to always close when I was a pharmacy tech and sometimes I forget how much I hated it. I could never really do stuff after work cause I got off too late
"
6085,"[7/17/20, 7:33:15 AM] Joe: Hahah true! Never again 😂

"
6094,"[7/17/20, 12:39:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha this is what today felt like. Some of the kids are so much work 😂
"
6095,"[7/17/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Especially if they decide you’re the “fun” counselor haha cause then they follow you around all day. They say my name so often hahaha it’s like my name being yelled is a constant background sound all day long haha
"
6096,"[7/17/20, 12:42:13 PM] Joe: Hahah sweet! I made it into your dream 😆 I hope it was a good dream haha
"
6097,"[7/17/20, 12:44:42 PM] Joe: Hahah I just want my own kid to annoy me. Not like 10 kids that aren’t mine all at once 😂
"
6098,"[7/17/20, 12:47:20 PM] Joe: Haha sounds like a great dream to me!
"
6099,"[7/17/20, 12:48:37 PM] Joe: I wouldn’t mind some of this right now. I need to touch you 😂 I feel like I haven’t touched another human in so long haha

"
6105,"[7/17/20, 3:00:10 PM] Joe: Damn learning the 3D stuff with someone sounds way better than learning alone. I wish I had a friend to learn how to code with.  It would’ve helped a lot.
"
6106,"[7/17/20, 3:00:24 PM] Joe: That’s really good though. I’m glad you stuck it out until you got it done haha
