","[4/25/20, 1:19:59 PM] Lore: I love all dogs, some breeds seem great to me, like Kenya (weimar braco) super athletic, intelligent, affectionate.....but the chuchos are special, they are a mix, they have personality and they are usually in kennels. I don't like the business that is generated with breed dogs

","[5/11/20, 5:41:32 PM] Lore: ahora estaba mirando una página que me gusta mucho, me apunté a un curso de marketing digital, para instagram y son videos muy cortos.... aunque tengo que reconocer, que si me quedo muchas veces más tarde de lo normal, no es solo por la cuarentena, es por que hablo con vos

","and to be able to be accompanied again with people who don´t live with you, such as friends, family, small groups...

","[5/15/20, 12:52:30 PM] Lore: soy consciente de que hay puestos de trabajo que se eliminan, y que es una mierda, pero también la sociedad en la que vivimos, va a un ritmo muy rápido, y tenés que ajustarte a ella... yo no tengo tiempo o ganas incluso muchas veces, de recorrerme la ciudad para comprar un libro en un sitio, una cafetera en otro, etc.. es algo muy cómodo... y además podés ver opiniones del resto, es como que se crea una comunidad..

","[5/15/20, 1:31:26 PM] Lore: mmm... no me guío tanto por los politicos, normalmente son todos unos mentirosos y me cuesta creerles, incluso si alguno tiene razón en algo, siempre es un titere por los intereses que hay detrás. Solo me identifico con uno de ellos, un ex presidente uruguayo, ""Pepe Mujica"", tengo admiración por ese hombre y su filosofía
","[5/15/20, 1:32:55 PM] Lore: en realidad lo que yo pienso, y me gustaría para mi futuro, y de las siguientes generaciones, es que no se pierda nunca la importancia de la sanidad, una buena asistencia médica para todo el mundo, sin restricciones
","[5/15/20, 1:35:20 PM] Lore: la educación también me parece clave, me gusta mucho los sistemas educativos, que utilizan diferentes países nórdicos, como Finlandia principalmente... ser más prácticos, no tan cuadriculados, poder valorar que existen diferentes tipos de inteligencias, que se valore más todo el tema cultural, en cuanto a artes, música, etc
","[5/15/20, 1:37:15 PM] Lore: y al final la educación es importante también, para los futuros puestos de trabajo... todos son validos, que cada uno pueda elegir lo que le guste realmente, que no existan tantas diferencias salariales
","[5/15/20, 1:39:36 PM] Lore: en cuanto a tema económico, una renta básica independientemente si hay actividad o no, seria lo ideal, por todo lo que comentaste anteriorimente, es lo mínimo... hay muchas situaciones jodidas, y la gente no deberia quedar excluida, o pasar hambre, por no tener comida básica
","[5/15/20, 1:41:32 PM] Lore: y bueno, Mujica, por ejemplo en Uruguay adoptó medidas que para mi son significativas, son una evolución, y me siento orgullosa que en un pais de america latina se hayan adoptado medidas como, legalizacion de marihuana,  matrimonio homosexual, opcion a aboto legal, y ayudas para gente pobre
","[5/15/20, 1:45:34 PM] Lore: *ABORTO ( no sé que traducción te habrá dado Google) jaja

","[5/16/20, 3:36:35 AM] Lore: mmm.. te lo envié porque los videos de este chico me parecen interesantes, toca temas de los que ya hablamos, como idioma, y personalidad.. por lo que nos conocemos por acá, se podría decir que vos sos más introvertido y yo más extrovertida, pero al final yo creo que ahora, ambos estamos balanceados. Me pareció bueno, como el chico habló también de la personalidad de una persona introvertida, su visión, e incluso diferentes etapas de la vida en las que ejerces un rol diferente.
","[5/16/20, 3:39:24 AM] Lore: mi madre siempre me dijo que tuve mucho caracter, aunque en el colegio, tenia una personalidad más introvertida.. no sé hasta que punto, pero recuerdo que era más tímida, a partir de los 15 años, todo eso se esfumó sin darme cuenta.
","[5/16/20, 3:43:06 AM] Lore: Por ejemplo, el trabajo donde estamos con Sandra, fue un proceso de selección de entrevista individual y grupal, y luego hicimos un viaje a Barcelona, para formación todo el equipo. Sandra era suuuuuuper timida,  y yo polo opuesto, ni nos hablamos durante entrevista, yo cree vinculo con otras personas más activas, y luego al final, trabajando, empezamos a charlar diferentes cosas, y ahora es la persona con la que mejor me llevo. A día de hoy, hablamos de eso y nos parece curioso como al final llegamos a el punto, incluso vivir juntas
","[5/16/20, 3:43:30 AM] Lore: jajaja yo... blablabla .. sorry
","[5/16/20, 3:59:22 AM] Lore: jajaja no sé, me encanta hacer vinculos con todo el mundo, incluso con una hormiga que pase por al lado mio.. jajaja pero tengo que reconocer, que me atrae cuando alguien es introvertido, quiero romper esa barrera y que conmigo sea una persona más abierta, no sé jaja no sé si entenderás esto..
","[5/16/20, 4:00:11 AM] Lore: claro... durante tu día todo fue más intenso, más cosas, mi día de ayer fue politica, hoy idiomas y ""psicología""

","[5/17/20, 4:08:36 AM] Lore: acabo de terminar de ver el video, muy interesante. gracias!
","[5/17/20, 4:13:43 AM] Lore: tsssss
","[5/17/20, 4:14:18 AM] Lore: gente ignorante no se divide por clases sociales, si uno es más rico o más pobre
","[5/17/20, 4:14:56 AM] Lore: hay gente tomando decisiones muy malas, que afectan a todos, incluso mundialmente
","[5/17/20, 4:15:45 AM] Lore: puto ascooo
","[5/17/20, 4:17:25 AM] Lore: no tiene sentido, pero siempre la policia abusa de poder...
","[5/17/20, 4:18:36 AM] Lore: acá en la ciudad se ve de todo, mucha gente corriendo sin mascarilla.. es incomoda? si, pero hay que intentar llevarla.. por que un día se puede contagiar alguien de tu familia, o la gente no tendrá como vivir por la falta de trabajo, creo que hay gente que no es consciente de esta situación

","[5/17/20, 4:25:08 AM] Lore: yo tampoco confio mucho, pero intento tener respeto y consideración, es algo temporal, y tenemos que recuperar la normalidad... yo no lo estoy pasando mal, no me falta comida, ni me aburro, hago cosas, estoy sana, etc... pero no paro de pensar en que hay gente que si, que debe estar pasando una muy mala situación, y hay que ser un poquito responsable y tener empatía...
","[5/17/20, 4:31:07 AM] Lore: Si ahí por lo que me muestras, no hay gente parece... acá mucha... yo no sé si en algún momento me contagiaré... cada vez que salgo es inevitable mantener la distancia, como zombies en una ciudad, hay muchas personas para las calles..

","[5/17/20, 4:35:07 AM] Lore: es como que tenemos una presión a decidir bien, y no fracasar. Hay gente que no lo toma tan serio, no da demasiada importancia. Yo tomo notas, cuando tengo que tomar decisiones, necesito hacer esquema o listas, pros y contras, y así lo veo mucho más claro, hay veces que me funciona jajaja
","[5/17/20, 4:35:32 AM] Lore: Volvés al final, dónde vas a vivir, en lo de tus padres?
","[5/17/20, 4:36:35 AM] Lore: Si, pero totalmente cierto... esperamos que otra persona decida, ya que se supone que tiene mejores conocimientos.. entonces nos relajamos y esa decisión no es nuestra
","[5/17/20, 4:37:40 AM] Lore: y vos que haces a la hora de tomar decisiones, te cuesta o utilizas alguna tecnica?
","[5/17/20, 4:45:10 AM] Lore: hay algo que te costó más tiempo en decidir, decisiones de vida? o algo a día de hoy, que no tengas claro que decisión tomar?

","[5/23/20, 5:06:43 AM] Lore: y luego no sé, odio todo el tema este de la sobreprotección, me gustaría criar a mis hijos en contacto con la naturaleza, con respeto de los animales... que sepa hacer varias cosas, no tanto como en la escuela, y compartir viajes.. no sé si me explico
","[5/23/20, 5:10:07 AM] Lore: mmm jaja si hizo mal la traducción. Yo solo tengo un hermano, (Gastón), por eso me gustaría tener más. Y por otro lado, no tendría un hijo solo, desde mi punto de vista, tienen un cariño extra de los padres, no saben lo que es compartir, y poder jugar con otros hermanos, eso puede afectar en sus futuras relaciones, vínculos con la sociedad
","[5/23/20, 5:10:44 AM] Lore: * Se hizo mal la traducción
","[5/23/20, 5:15:44 AM] Lore: jaja mierda, sigo pensando en ello, jajaja estas preguntas me hacen pensar cosas más internas

","[5/23/20, 5:36:33 AM] Lore: yo te di ""detalles"", de lo que creo que sería una buena educación, respecto a lo convencional... obviamente intentaría ver sus cualidades para que hagan lo que más les guste y sean felices
","[5/23/20, 5:42:14 AM] Lore: jaja no pasa nada, podemos pensar de maneras diferentes en algunas cosas jaja, solo que me chocó verlo así, pensé que me decías a mi controlador, jamás haría eso, de hecho las cosas que pienso, son las que me gustaría para que puedan tener más libertad en la vida
","[5/23/20, 5:47:03 AM] Lore: jajajaja
","[5/23/20, 5:50:08 AM] Lore: y una última cosa jajaja, no sé como serán ahi los padres... pero en esta sociedad, muchas veces los hombres quedan en un segundo plano con sus hijos, las madres parece que lo hacen todo ""mejor"" únicas e irreemplazables. No estoy para nada de acuerdo con ello, un hijo es de dos, me gustaría que el padre de mi hijo, pueda tener un contacto tan cercano, como el de una mujer.. no sé como.. jaja estaría genial que tenga pechos y pueda tener el también ese vinculo, jaja esto no lo pensé mucho...
","[5/23/20, 5:51:10 AM] Lore: pero es que con lo que te conté, del hermano de Sandra... es super buen hombre, y lo esta pasando muy muy mal, la mujer nunca dejaba que el tome decisiones, y ahora lo aleja de su hijo... todo tiene que ser como ella dice, eso lo detesto!!!

Pasamos de fase muy lento. Nos costó 2 meses llevar a fase 1. Se supone que ahora podemos salir sin horario, ya empezaron a abrir muchas tiendas, peluquerías, restaurantes con aforo

","[6/4/20, 12:18:42 PM] Lore: creo que una plataforma como Youtube es genial, se pueden ver muchísimos videos de gente que tiene pensamientos interesantes o que construye cosas así, y su intención es solo compartirlo.. muy diferente a la parte negra de Youtube, de gente superficial, egocéntrica que quiere likes o dicen cosas sin sentido

","
","But I think most people here would say 9-10 is normal. I’m weird 😂
","[4/24/20, 11:09:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeah super close to the beach haha. I have to drive nicest beaches but there are some decent small beaches I can walk or skate to.
","[4/24/20, 11:09:37 AM] Joe: The town is called Kailua-Kona
","[4/24/20, 11:47:54 AM] Joe: Thanks! Before quarantine I was skating to the beach everyday and I was loving it. Definitely need a beach near by wherever I end up.
","[4/24/20, 11:49:52 AM] Joe: Haha yeah Kailua is kind of a tourist town but it’s cool and really mellow compared to Honolulu
","[4/24/20, 12:13:57 PM] Joe: I can’t skate into town where all the good skate spots are now and I can’t skate to the good beaches either but it’s ok to skate down the road. Skating the road is fine for exercise but I want to actually skate fun spots 😂
","[4/24/20, 12:15:58 PM] Joe: I’ve never been to Honolulu but I doubt I would like it haha. Too many humans and it’s like a fake Hawaii. 
","
","The other side of the island I’m on has the best nature spots. Beautiful waterfalls and forest  🌳
","[4/24/20, 12:46:10 PM] Joe: There isn’t much near me but the main road and some hotels. The fun places are just random spots downtown. Ledges, benches, rails, & stairs but they’re all in an area we’re not supposed to be.
","[4/24/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: I’d love to show it to you anytime ☺️
","[4/24/20, 1:25:44 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha

","[4/24/20, 1:59:54 PM] Joe: eso está bien, enviar todos los gifs jaja no se detienen
","[4/24/20, 2:03:51 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I might stay in bed longer if I had a reason to hahaha

","[4/24/20, 3:47:57 PM] Joe: I’ll try my best to stay out of jail. I’ve done pretty good at that so far haha
","[4/24/20, 4:07:34 PM] Joe: 😂
","[4/24/20, 4:08:28 PM] Joe: I want to ask you, what do you usually like to do for fun? What keeps you entertained?
","[4/24/20, 4:30:22 PM] Joe: Nice nice. I like that you’re creative and that you love the outdoors so much. That’s really cool. Yoga is ok, I took a class once, it was a little harder than I though it would be but I was enjoying it by the end of the class.
","[4/24/20, 4:54:33 PM] Joe: Haha you look like you’re fun to hang out with. Always with a drink near by 🍹

","[4/25/20, 3:22:18 AM] Joe: Yeah kids are great. That’s one reason I really enjoy my job at the skatepark. We do those summer camps and working with the kids is really fun. They can be little jerks sometimes hahaha but for the most part kids I like children. How about you?
","[4/25/20, 3:29:34 AM] Joe: It’s true! Some of them seem like they just want to make you mad 😡 they think it’s hilarious or they want attention. Their games don’t work on me though, by the end of the week I usually have them on my side haha.

","[4/25/20, 12:02:14 PM] Joe: His name is Oni and he is Ang’s cat. He loves to meow a little too much sometimes which can be annoying but he’s alright.
","[4/25/20, 12:02:44 PM] Joe: He is like me though. Only super affectionate if he is comfortable with you. He runs away from strangers haha
","[4/25/20, 12:32:52 PM] Joe: Damn that sounds rough. I wonder how long until there are zero restrictions? This whole thing is so weird.
","[4/25/20, 12:34:04 PM] Joe: Yeah dogs are the best. I want a dog again soon!
","[4/25/20, 12:35:39 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I guess that’s true. Good thing I don’t run away from strangers or I wouldn’t be talking to you ☺️
","
","Wouldn’t have got that free bud the other day from the hippies either lol
","[4/25/20, 12:44:49 PM] Joe: I like your attitude 🔥🔥
","[4/25/20, 12:46:53 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m waiting for the right time too. I need to settle in somewhere first. Wouldn’t be fair to the dog otherwise.
","
","I had 2 dogs when I was little and i always loved having them around
","[4/25/20, 12:48:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh noooo 🙈
","[4/25/20, 12:59:27 PM] Joe: Yeah I was impressed by the old people weed haha. Not bad! I always assume old people have bammer(bad weed)
","[4/25/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I guess I prefer “chucho”(we call a dog without a breed “mutt”). 
","
","I used to like breeds but breeding dogs is kind of weird when you really think about it. Trying to get certain features even if it’s not good for the dog is sad to me 😞
","[4/25/20, 1:14:46 PM] Joe: I mean, they’re the way nature made them, and that’s fine with me. 
","
","Does that mean you prefer chucho? It’s ok to like dogs with breeds, they are just not for me haha
","[4/25/20, 1:27:36 PM] Joe: I feel similar about the business from dog breeding. I would never hold it against a dog for being a pure breed and would still love them but I couldn’t bring myself to seek out a pure bred dog when looking to get one if that means I’m helping those kind of businesses. 
","
","My friend has a pure bred French bulldog and I have to admit that little thing is cute as fuck 😂 A little small though haha
","
","Good to know we’re on similar page though haha
","[4/25/20, 3:27:56 PM] Joe: 🤔 looks kind of flat. Is it a picture? Oh, or a book?
","[4/25/20, 3:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha I really don’t know. What is it?
","[4/25/20, 3:29:50 PM] Joe: A letter. Written with a feather pen like it’s the 1700s hahaha
","[4/25/20, 3:35:55 PM] Joe: 😂 I never would’ve guessed that!
","[4/25/20, 3:37:18 PM] Joe: Very cool though
","[4/25/20, 3:38:53 PM] Joe: Hahahah you’ll get it down I’m sure.
","You’re only seeing what some tattoos would look like? Not going to ink yourself up??
","[4/25/20, 3:45:25 PM] Joe: Damn that’s a good idea. I just go to my cousin and tell him the idea and we figure out hahaha
","
","He’s really good though so it’s not like I’m going to my cousins house or something. He works in a shop

","[4/25/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Silly! But I don’t think it’s silly at all 🙃 that makes sense
","
","
","I only have 4. Two on my right arm, one on my right shoulder, and a tiny B with a circle on my side that my friend did while we were drunk at his apartment hahaha that one is funny. It took him soooo long just to make the tiny B.
","[4/25/20, 4:03:20 PM] Joe: I don’t really know exactly where I want the next one but I want one on my side wrapping around to the front a little, like the rib cage area I guess.  And more on my back would be nice. I take forever to think of something though
","[4/25/20, 4:03:42 PM] Joe: Oh maybe the forearm too

","[4/25/20, 4:29:36 PM] Joe: No worries! Plenty of time hahaha take some tomorrow or whenever you feel like it.
","[4/25/20, 4:29:54 PM] Joe: Oh there it is never mind haha
","[4/25/20, 4:30:52 PM] Joe: My friend used to love making these and would always try to get everyone to drink matte with him hahaha that’s a cool one
","[4/25/20, 4:31:15 PM] Joe: Very cute
","[4/25/20, 4:34:20 PM] Joe: Those are awesome and I love that they have meaning for you.

","The friend was someone I grew up skating with but I don’t see him much anymore. Interesting guy, he would always be making his own beer, wine, or cider and trying to get everyone drinking matte with him.
","[4/25/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Muy interesante 😂

","I think his parents are Irish or something like that. He’s Super white boy haha

","[4/25/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 😂
","[4/25/20, 4:51:01 PM] Joe: It was good. I drink my coffee black so I kind of like bitter drinks haha. 
","
","He had it in a cup just like your tattoo, straw and everything. He would drink it pretty often.
","[4/25/20, 5:04:03 PM] Joe: His straw was aluminum hahaha. I guess he knew what he was doing all along 😂
","[4/25/20, 5:04:26 PM] Joe: Ok, sleep well. Talk to you later. Un beso

","[4/26/20, 9:37:14 AM] Joe: Hahahaha
","[4/26/20, 9:39:27 AM] Joe: At least I’m getting practice. That’s good. I’ve practiced more this week than I have in years. I’m starting to pick it up. 
","
","When I started watching that show I could barely catch any words but by the end of season 1 I can understand a lot more. Watching that show is a great way to pick up spanish hahaha
","[4/26/20, 9:54:41 AM] Joe: Well, I really appreciate the lessons professor 👩‍🏫
","[4/26/20, 11:00:42 AM] Joe: It’s was insane! My hands were sweating sometimes hahaha
","
","So far I really like most of the people doing the robbery. Except maybe Berlin. And my most hated character is that Arturo guy. He’s a piece of shit 😂 😂 
","
","But the professor, Tokyo, Denver, and Nairobi are my favorites I think. Helsinki is funny too.
","[4/26/20, 11:30:15 AM] Joe: Oh yeah I forgot about Rio. He is good too. 
","
","When the professor was about to kill the inspectors mom I was losing it hahahaha

","Plot twist around every corner 😂
","[4/26/20, 12:02:37 PM] Joe: I have a lot to watch before I catch up to you haha. Yeah, don’t spoil 🙉🙉

","[4/26/20, 12:29:48 PM] Joe: Yes! Show me!
","[4/26/20, 12:30:13 PM] Joe: That’s sounds super complicated haha that’s so cool though
","[4/26/20, 12:41:22 PM] Joe: That’s siiiiick!! How long does it take to model stuff like that? 
","
","I’m jealous. I want to know how to do that now haha
","[4/26/20, 12:53:42 PM] Joe: Cooooool haha I’m definitely going to learn how to do that someday. Looks like you can make some interesting stuff if you get good. 
","
","What do you want to use the skill for? For interior design?
","[4/26/20, 12:54:21 PM] Joe: That makes sense. I’m the same when I’m learning something in programming
","[4/26/20, 1:04:03 PM] Joe: Nice. Definitely send more of your work to me if you need someone to show off to haha I’m very interested in it!
","[4/26/20, 1:08:57 PM] Joe: My stuff is boring hahah. The last thing I worked on was a website so I guess I can show you that. I only did a few parts of it though. The top section and “the team” section. 
","
","Cronycreative.com
","
","Before that I was working on automation scripts/code that would complete teachers work logging grades. Can’t really show that one but it basically just made the computer automatically transfer grades from one website to another
","[4/26/20, 1:16:07 PM] Joe: No I don’t chose any design at all. I just build it to look like what the designer made.
","[4/26/20, 1:16:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
","[4/26/20, 1:17:42 PM] Joe: So if you need a website you can draw up what you want or make it using a program called Adobe XD and I can make it for you 👍
","[4/26/20, 1:18:03 PM] Joe: But don’t ask me to design anything cause I’m terrible at that part hahaha

","[4/26/20, 1:40:14 PM] Joe: That’s the plan! And yeah, there is a lot of code to make a website.
","
","I was surprised by how much it took to make something simple when I first started learning.
","[4/26/20, 1:42:44 PM] Joe: Hahaha oh nooooo 😱

","[4/26/20, 1:47:12 PM] Joe: 🤗
","[4/26/20, 1:50:32 PM] Joe: I said that to make that simple webpage I need to open this program and its all just a bunch of words haha
","[4/26/20, 1:51:34 PM] Joe: I said too much in the video hahah. But basically it takes all the code I showed in the program to make the website I was showing
","[4/26/20, 2:01:25 PM] Joe: Send music to me!
","[4/26/20, 2:05:33 PM] Joe: It’s my turn to judge you haha👨‍⚖️
","[4/27/20, 10:14:12 AM] Joe: Buenas noches 🌙
","[4/27/20, 10:29:20 AM] Joe: Buenas tardes(?) haha
","
","Only a few more days until you’re allowed outside. You must be looking forward to that.
","[4/27/20, 10:39:49 AM] Joe: I feel it. Your lockdown sounds extreme. I’m good with not being around people and doing my own thing but it’s nice to mix it up. 
","
","What’s the first thing you’re going to do?
","[4/27/20, 10:41:04 AM] Joe: Whatever you like haha I’m not super picky with music and I probably won’t actually judge you so send anything 🤙
","[4/27/20, 10:52:56 AM] Joe: Damn that’s rough. I wonder when it goes back to normal completely
","[4/27/20, 10:53:22 AM] Joe: That sounds super chill. At least you have something to look forward to for now.
","[4/27/20, 11:07:51 AM] Joe: I like this one haha very cool
","[4/27/20, 11:10:56 AM] Joe: Pretty cool how everyone looks so “low key”(informal) in those last two
","[4/27/20, 11:11:28 AM] Joe: Haha good choice
","[4/27/20, 11:15:08 AM] Joe: That’s a good mix. I listen to a pretty wide variety of stuff too. Sometimes I’ll like a song I would usually never like just because it was in a skate video haha so that leads to me liking some weird shit sometimes.
","But if it reminds me of the persons skate part and gets me hyped I like it 🤷‍♂️
","[4/27/20, 11:31:27 AM] Joe: Haha I’m not judging you. I like your music but even if I didn’t I wouldn’t judge you for it
","[4/27/20, 11:32:21 AM] Joe: Sure, I’ll keep you in mind when I hear new songs I like haha. The Hawaiian jams are so good. I love the vibe.
","[4/27/20, 11:44:08 AM] Joe: Today I’ve been lazy. I’m still sitting in bed with Oni 😂 
","
","I finished my recent job last week so I don’t have much to do until I get my next job. Freelance life or whatever haha

","[4/27/20, 3:03:05 PM] Joe: Oh ok. How hot is it out there?

","It’s 70-85F here pretty much everyday.

","I hear you on eating more responsible/sustainable. Would be nice to give it a try. If anything just cut back slightly on the amount of animal product and when I do eat animals try to get stuff that is raised better than the big commercial farm animals.
","[4/27/20, 4:33:09 PM] Joe: Ooooh I’m so excited I might get my infamous dice game working today hahaha. It’s still super ugly cause like I said I’m terrible at design but if it works that’s all that matters to me. 
","
","Although, I might at least make the dice look like actual dice eventually. That’s a lot of work for a dumb game for me and my friends though 😆
","[4/27/20, 4:47:19 PM] Joe: Yeah I just need to get one more thing working. The game needs to sign out users automatically when they close the game so I’m working on that. 
","
","
","The game is called 3s. You roll dice and have to pick up at least one die after every roll. If you pick up a 3 it counts as 0 but all other die give you the value that you rolled when you pick it up. 
","
","
","The goal is to get the lowest score by the end
","[4/27/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: Your turn is over after you pick up all the dice

","[4/27/20, 5:22:15 PM] Joe: Hahahaha it’s broken! I know I know I’m sorry. I’ll get it working for real soon. At least you got to test it once. You can give me design tips and put web designer on your résumé 😂

","[4/27/20, 5:26:23 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I’m super stoked. I stopped working on the game for a few days cause I was frustrated I couldn’t get it working. Getting past this step was a big hurdle so I’m happy.
","[4/27/20, 5:27:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha I guess it could use more of a victory dance type of feel after the win
","[4/27/20, 5:28:20 PM] Joe: Sound would be interesting just because I’ve never had to add sound to a site. Would probably be pretty simple 🤔
","[4/27/20, 5:29:43 PM] Joe: I think that was it. I just needed a break. The solution in the end wasn’t even very difficult to fix but finding where the problem was in the first place was killing me. Had a eureka moment this morning while watching some coding seminar thing on YouTube haha
","[4/27/20, 5:33:46 PM] Joe: If official...Lore the web designer 👩‍🎨
","[4/27/20, 5:38:21 PM] Joe: That’s solid advice. I could really use a checklist or something when I do stuff like this. I usually just start coding without much of a plan beforehand and it gets me into trouble all the time hahaha

","They’re fine with you being out but you can’t sit at the beach on a towel or chair. I usually look like I’m on the move when I’m outside so they think I’m just exercising.

","It was only noticeable because they’re were sat on the bench near a bunch of super brown Hawaiian dudes that were getting ready to surf.

","At least gifs work for jokes haha. Gif....the universal language
","[4/28/20, 4:00:49 PM] Joe: Hahahaha I don’t take notes of it but I will smoke pretty often 😂

","I guess if one ounce last me one month the math works out to about 1 gram per day
","[4/28/20, 4:02:55 PM] Joe: That’s out here in Hawaii. I guess in California it’s a lot less cause I work a lot when I’m out there

","I’m sure it can look better somehow so I’m going to just experiment with it. Try random stuff and see what I like. If anything it’ll be good practice.

","[4/29/20, 2:29:37 PM] Joe: Oh and you can roll up to 5 times at the most. You have to pick up at least one die every time you roll but can pick up more if you want.

","[5/1/20, 9:55:18 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I noticed that 😂

","[5/1/20, 9:57:32 AM] Joe: I have to fix the tie also. It says the first player wins on a tie every time
","[5/1/20, 9:58:54 AM] Joe: Oh yeah. Um you just have to go to the website again. I haven’t figured out why that happens if you press reload
","[5/1/20, 10:00:04 AM] Joe: Hahaha I appreciate you taking the time to try it. You give good feedback that makes the game better
","[5/1/20, 10:06:10 AM] Joe: Haha it was the same guy! My friend Fav does all the illustrations and drew the animations in the Benal video by hand, frame by frame. He was in the video too. I love his style of illustrations
","[5/1/20, 10:07:37 AM] Joe: Yeah I need emojis, gifs, and pictures for the chat. That’s a little more complicated but it can be done. That would definitely make it cooler.

","I added rooms so everyone doesn’t have to be in the same game and that took all yesterday to figure out haha.

","[5/3/20, 5:42:15 PM] Joe: Haha they’ll get too excited. I’m going to be back in California in about a month so I’ll surprise them with some spanish when I get back. They’ll love it
","[5/3/20, 5:45:52 PM] Joe: Being consistent that’s all that matters to me. I don’t want to switch between accents in the middle of sentences. People will think I’m a weirdo haha
","
","
","If someone went from a New York accent to Texas accent, to California accent in a few sentences it would be super weird. I assume it would be similar switching between accents in Spanish too haha
","[5/3/20, 5:57:25 PM] Joe: Yeah we should do that haha otherwise I’ll just tell them how I want to smoke a joint

","[5/3/20, 6:10:25 PM] Joe: Hahahaha!
","[5/3/20, 6:11:55 PM] Joe: Hahaha I was really just joking I’m sorry 😂 
","
","I don’t even like talking to people hahaha
","[5/3/20, 6:13:27 PM] Joe: But also when you say that, I kind of take it as you wanting to be just friends or something so I don’t push the issue 🤷‍♂️
","[5/3/20, 6:13:58 PM] Joe: Even though I do like you very much hahaha 🤗🤗
","[5/3/20, 6:15:39 PM] Joe: If you knew me well, you would’ve thought the gif was funny because I’m faaaar from a “ladies man” hahaha. I’ve had like, 3 girlfriends, all pretty long term relationships
","
","Anyways, hope you’re not actually bummed on that 😬
","[5/3/20, 6:16:52 PM] Joe: I’m definitely not someone that is in constant contact with my friends. I can go a pretty long time without talking to anyone haha
","[5/3/20, 6:17:39 PM] Joe: And usually I avoid talking to strangers but if it’s a cool girl from across the world or an old hippie giving weed I’ll make an exception lol
","[5/3/20, 6:19:34 PM] Joe: Haha I’m pretty much the same. The more distance the more fun to talk to maybe 😂
","[5/3/20, 6:20:24 PM] Joe: It definitely helps when you make me do embarrassing things that you’re so far away
","[5/3/20, 6:25:00 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got a little bit out of me 🤐

","[5/4/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I agree with you there. I don’t see how the show can go on now though haha! 
","
","Seems like that was a fine place to end it. But, 2 parts to go so I guess there is a lot more to go.

","[5/4/20, 2:02:19 PM] Joe: Haha no it’s not like that 😂 
","
","I don’t know why. The best explanation I got from my friend that originally came up with it was because he was on mushrooms hahaha

","[5/5/20, 1:16:20 PM] Joe: 🤔 I’m not sure what you mean. You notice a lot of small details ahah. I think you would be good at this
","[5/5/20, 1:32:47 PM] Joe: Shit. More color picking haha.
","[5/5/20, 1:33:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn you’re good
","[5/5/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: That was quick 😂
","[5/5/20, 1:35:24 PM] Joe: Learn to use Adobe XD and I bet you’ll be able to land freelance jobs doing graphic/web design. Cause people like me have no idea what we’re doing and need help hahah
","[5/5/20, 1:44:37 PM] Joe: Adobe XD is mostly drag and drop. More similar to using photoshop than coding. You would be good at it. 
","
","Then you hand the design off to someone like me to build it. 
","
","
","When you’re ready to design a site for your interior design stuff, try out Adobe XD and I’ll build what you come up with haha
","[5/5/20, 1:51:24 PM] Joe: Haha yeah it’s a pretty cool program for making small designs. I should really practice using it and work on my design skill 😂 
","
","I guess I would be considered developer, not a designer. The people that are really good at both are rare but I’d like to get there one day
","[5/5/20, 2:02:36 PM] Joe: You should’ve seen some of my first website hahaha. Oh god. They looked like they were designed by a 5 year old with a crayon 😂
","[5/5/20, 2:03:34 PM] Joe: Design is weird to me cause of the subjectivity. The code either works, or it doesn’t. But the design is much harder to tell if it’s good in my opinion
","[5/5/20, 2:04:18 PM] Joe: Well...I can tell when something is ugly, and I can tell when it looks good. But coming up with the good looking design in my mind is so difficult!
","[5/5/20, 2:22:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha ok, enjoy!
","[5/5/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Yeah when I first started making websites. They were all so ugly. Good thing I didn’t save those haha
","[5/5/20, 3:44:02 PM] Joe: The best part is you never fully know how to code so there is always a bunch you can learn. Makes it so it doesn’t get boring
","[5/5/20, 3:45:24 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I dont visit enough websites but I started going to random ones for bigger companies to get an idea of how the pros do it
","[5/5/20, 3:45:55 PM] Joe: I’m really far off from their style hahaha but if I get a design I can make it so it doesn’t matter too much I guess.

","‎[5/5/20, 4:26:54 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/5/20, 4:28:11 PM] Joe: motivación para aprender jajaja
","[5/5/20, 4:34:40 PM] Joe: Mmmm I mean...I used to work at a marijuana distribution center in California so I know a little bit of how it works haha
","[5/5/20, 4:35:26 PM] Joe: I don’t know what you mean by this
","[5/5/20, 4:37:23 PM] Joe: Well....it’s all legal, just a lot of regulations. But a licensed farmer takes the crop and gets it tested by the state for purity and quality. They also give the THC/ CBD content as a % of weight.
","[5/5/20, 4:39:21 PM] Joe: Then the farmer can sell it to a distribution center like the place I worked at. We were small and only would buy maybe 10-20 pounds at a time but big places buy way more. 
","
","We take the weed and package it in 1/8ths or 1gram packages or we would make joints with this machine that could make 100 joints at a time haha
","[5/5/20, 4:39:59 PM] Joe: Then we take our packed product and sell them to retail marijuana stores that can sell to anyone 21+
","[5/5/20, 4:40:59 PM] Joe: Basically like any other business but a lot of paperwork and regulations. It was an interesting job. It was only me and one of my friends working the whole distribution so it was really fun hahaha
","‎[5/5/20, 4:42:39 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/5/20, 4:44:06 PM] Joe: I was really good at that job and like it a lot but they treated my friend like shit, then when they fired him I just walked out haha
","[5/5/20, 4:45:39 PM] Joe: Oooh ok. Yeah I’ve done trimming one season and I didn’t like it hahah. That was more farm work
","[5/5/20, 4:46:01 PM] Joe: My cousin grows so I tried it with him one year. I like the distribution side haha
","[5/5/20, 4:46:56 PM] Joe: Usually seasonal work on a farm involves trimming the plant. Usually paid per pound so it’s good money if you’re fast and know how to trim good but when you’re learning it’s not that great haha
","[5/5/20, 4:48:26 PM] Joe: Haha it was their loss not mine. They thought I’d stay when they fired him. Like I said, we ran the whole thing haha. 
","
","Plus i had another job at the time. I only took the distribution gig cause my friend worked there
","[5/5/20, 4:49:09 PM] Joe: Hahaha distribution is hard too!! It had way more variety of stuff to do though and I just found it more fun.
","[5/5/20, 4:49:35 PM] Joe: The real posh boys are the ones in the retail part hahah
","[5/5/20, 4:50:22 PM] Joe: They don’t do shit but give the person what they order and they get tips and all kinds of shit.  You’d probably make hella good money working at a cannabis club hahaha
","[5/5/20, 4:59:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha yeah I think “posh” is good for boy and girl like that. English doesn’t make too many changes based on masculine/feminine. That is one thing that makes spanish hard for me haha
","[5/5/20, 5:00:40 PM] Joe: When to say “o” or “a” kind of makes sense to me but in practice, switching between them at the right time can be a little hard
","[5/5/20, 5:01:16 PM] Joe: Mostly when speaking. If I’m typing it’s easier
","[5/5/20, 5:07:08 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha!!

","[5/6/20, 9:55:08 AM] Joe: Haha another example of me being terrible with colors!
","[5/6/20, 10:13:04 AM] Joe: Haha alright cool! Sounds like I have something to do today now 😂 
","
","Yeah I was thinking the logo should be on the dice page too. Ok ok, smaller chat and logo. What should I do with the “players” make it smaller? Different color? Get rid of it? I dont knooooow
","[5/6/20, 10:13:39 AM] Joe: I appreciate the thought you’re putting into this haha it really does help a lot

","[5/6/20, 11:12:25 AM] Joe: When you make something you worked really hard on or you’re proud of, send some photos
","[5/6/20, 11:14:24 AM] Joe: Aaah it’s a good thing. These ideas will help make everything look complete instead of like a half finished project. Plus any tips you give me to work on are good practice for me.
","[5/6/20, 11:14:57 AM] Joe: You’re definitely keeping me busy though boss haha

","[5/6/20, 11:47:31 AM] Joe: Ok ok

","[5/9/20, 1:33:40 PM] Joe: Haha it felt like skateboarding to me. Trying to make the plane look like it’s doing tricks with style. Making it dance in the sky. Plus it felt like doing flip tricks on a skateboard. Flip the plane fast and try to stop it at the right time and fly away smooth. It was fun 🤷‍♂️
","[5/9/20, 1:33:51 PM] Joe: I don’t have planes anymore though haha
","[5/9/20, 1:39:11 PM] Joe: Partly because my ankle got better and I could finally skate again....and partly because the dude that was giving me free planes suddenly passes away and that I a CRAZY expensive hobby. Definitely couldn’t have flown those big ones if they weren’t free hahaha

","[5/10/20, 3:32:32 PM] Joe: Yeah I didn’t like the way the dice would move all over the place after you pick one. Sometime it would make you choose the wrong dice because they’d move after you pick one up. Now they animate off the screen after you pick one but the remaining dice stay still

","[5/10/20, 3:49:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I got way too into making this game. It’s been really good practice though. I’ve learned about a bunch of stuff I’ve never used before to make this one.

","[5/10/20, 3:58:14 PM] Joe: The funny thing is I was going to stop at the point where it worked. I just wanted to play with my friends. 
","
","But then they asked if I could make the dice look like dice. And the one friend asked if he could draw a logo. And you started making suggestions. Team effort hahah
","[5/10/20, 3:59:01 PM] Joe: Most features were requested by others. I just built it haha
","[5/10/20, 4:07:44 PM] Joe: Yeah now I just need to come up with more ideas that they like so they’ll help me with ideas haha
","
","
","Right now I’m trying to build a generic e-commerce site so they can all just drop in their art or clothing they want to sell and some images and have a working site. That’s been going a lot slower haha

","[5/10/20, 4:48:51 PM] Joe: Haha I’ll show you eventually. It’s supposed to be very minimal. Just enough to sell some items

","[5/10/20, 5:08:48 PM] Joe: I’ll get those cool new headphones with the built in translator 😂 😂

","
","
","But yeah no pressure to answer now. Just think about it
","[5/10/20, 5:29:21 PM] Joe: It was hard to ask haha. I’ve been thinking about it recently though and I don’t see why not. Am I just going to message you on WhatsApp forever? Or ask you to go on an adventure?
","[5/10/20, 5:31:10 PM] Joe: Take your time. And I won’t be crushed if you say no. But I would love if you said yes. I understand it’s kind of crazy.

","[5/10/20, 6:06:36 PM] Joe: Mmmm no I haven’t talked about it with anyone. It was probably about a week ago when I started considering it. When I realized I wake up and send you a message. Like i told you, i don’t talk to people. I’m fine with going long periods of time without talking and being comfortable with it. But I really like to talk to you
","[5/10/20, 6:07:59 PM] Joe: Haha hey that’s always an option too 😂 you probably like the island better though.
","[5/10/20, 6:12:01 PM] Joe: You have an attitude about life that I like. I like that you are outgoing and reached out to me in the first place. It’s like to tell you things or joke with you in ways that I’m sure are going to make you stop talking to me but you don’t. You seem fun. Lighthearted. I’m down for that
","[5/10/20, 6:18:39 PM] Joe: Fuck my life 🤦‍♂️
","[5/10/20, 6:19:18 PM] Joe: Well if you can’t come here. We can go somewhere else haha.
","[5/10/20, 6:26:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you slowly pulled me out of my shell. You can definitely tell me anything. I’d like to know more but I never know what to ask haha

","[5/10/20, 6:35:46 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha

","[5/11/20, 12:40:38 PM] Joe: 😂 didn’t expect that when I started the gif hahaha
","[5/11/20, 12:50:25 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah it’s a little much. I’m still trying to understand it completely. My cousins talk like that sometimes so I get to practice often
","[5/11/20, 1:20:59 PM] Joe: Hahah hopefully it doesn’t turn into some weird mixture of them all where I’m getting all of the  languages wrong 😆
","[5/11/20, 1:33:56 PM] Joe: Haha I know I know. I’m pretty determined to learn this time. Honestly I wasn’t taught much when I was little, only by my grandparents. My dad didn’t teach me anything and my mom only speaks English. 
","
","Then when I took spanish classes in high school i resented he fact that I didn’t already speak Spanish and didn’t really want to put in the effort to learn at that point. It was almost embarrassing to try since I felt like I should already know it. 
","
","But I’m over that hahah. I’m down to start from the bottom and feel like a dummy until I understand.
","[5/11/20, 3:24:09 PM] Joe: No hay problema. Cómo estuvo la cena?
","[5/11/20, 3:43:03 PM] Joe: Damn sound like a tough situation. That’s rough.
","[5/11/20, 3:46:15 PM] Joe: Haha I think my dad grew up in the US in a time where speaking Spanish wasn’t really popular. I don’t know, my grandma always told me he was embarrassed when she would speak Spanish to him in front of his friends when he was younger. He would tell her to speak English to him haha. I think he just wanted to be super American or something 🤷‍♂️
","[5/11/20, 3:46:58 PM] Joe: But he speaks Spanish great. I’ll embarrass the fuck out of myself if I try to speak to him in Spanish hahaha
","[5/11/20, 3:53:41 PM] Joe: Nope, never. 
","
","He would probably just laugh and correct whatever I say wrong or respond with so much I won’t understand all of it. Just my guess though hahah.
","[5/11/20, 3:55:57 PM] Joe: I probably wouldn’t even try to talk to him in spanish until I’ve felt confident in my ability for years hahaha. Not even going to do it. I don’t show him much of what I do 😂
","[5/11/20, 4:00:36 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah I guess he’d be happy. He would probably say something like, “you can get paid more now because you speak two languages” haha. Fucking dads 😂
","[5/11/20, 4:00:46 PM] Joe: Oh god Hahahaha
","[5/11/20, 4:02:23 PM] Joe: My dad would probably say so much shit to embarrass me knowing I won’t understand half of what he is telling you hahaha fuuuck
","[5/11/20, 4:02:29 PM] Joe: I better learn quick

","But when this one is done if you have some random shit you want to sell online let me know.
","[5/11/20, 4:14:36 PM] Joe: And you don’t really have to give me tips. I’m just working on this right now and wanted to show you 👨‍💻
","[5/11/20, 4:19:44 PM] Joe: Haha if you have an eye for what looks good in a room or on a wall, it’s very similar. It’s mostly about placement and relationships between the items on the screen to create the feeling you want. Drawing the eye to the important details and making the less important things a little more subtle, but still there and easy to read.
","[5/11/20, 4:20:07 PM] Joe: Haha no link yet. It’s only on my computer for now.
","[5/11/20, 4:26:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. I know it’s more than that and I hope you explain in more detail when you can. I want to hear more about it!
","[5/11/20, 4:27:54 PM] Joe: I was working on this for a month already before I started my dice game. I’ve been working slowly on this though cause no one I know needs it haha. Less motivation.
","[5/11/20, 4:29:07 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure. You can still teach me the basics so I know more what it’s about
","[5/11/20, 4:36:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah these are all just “stock” images from the web I used to make the layout. It’s just a fake store for now.
","[5/11/20, 4:37:17 PM] Joe: I did the design but it’s just super basic so it was easier. Just keep it to rectangular shapes and make the items in a grid. I just need to work on the buttons and the checkout process then it’s ready for real items.
","[5/11/20, 4:38:49 PM] Joe: Ok ok. These are the 2D plans? Then later you can make a badass 3D model with lighting and all the good shit??
","[5/11/20, 4:39:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh I can’t wait until you can make a whole tiny house in 3D. You can build your dream house and show it to me hahaha
","[5/11/20, 4:39:34 PM] Joe: Then maybe I can build it 😂
","[5/11/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Haha I would be just as bad at doing that layout as I am at web design 😂

","[5/11/20, 5:03:34 PM] Joe: Oh never mind. Just had to read it duh haha

","[5/11/20, 5:30:59 PM] Joe: Oh ok hahah no not at all
","[5/11/20, 5:32:35 PM] Joe: Yeah it was a bad translation. I was worried for a second hahah. Thought I was boring you. But no, these are the things I’m interested in so you’re not boring me even a little
","[5/11/20, 5:36:40 PM] Joe: no worries. I knew it was a bad translation because you said you, “find it hard to stop”. Wouldn’t be hard if it was boring hahah

","[5/11/20, 5:42:47 PM] Joe: Aaaah ok that makes sense. I stay up super late sometimes like I said before but I think more often I fall asleep early. At least compared to the schedule you’re on right now haha. I only get on the late night schedule when I have a project that I’m working on and need to get the ideas out before I forget 😂

","[5/12/20, 1:15:35 PM] Joe: But now I need to find out how many English words you need to learn to get a good understanding. Going to need it if you’re going to Hawaii 😂

","I wonder if it’s more, less, or the same amount of words 🤔

","[5/12/20, 1:21:25 PM] Joe: “
","If you learn only 800 of the most frequently-used lemmas in English, you'll be able to understand 75% of the language as it is spoken in normal life.”
","[5/12/20, 1:22:24 PM] Joe: Oh we’re going to meet hahah whether I go there or you come here or we go wherever we want...it’ll happen. I promise.
","[5/12/20, 1:25:22 PM] Joe: Haha true true. 5% different is weird though. In spanish you get 80% understanding with 1000 words but only get an additional 5% for the next 1000. 
","
","So 2000 words puts you at 85% understanding of spoken Spanish
","[5/12/20, 1:26:22 PM] Joe: And native speakers now between 10,000-20,000 words 🤯

","[5/12/20, 2:15:33 PM] Joe: I don’t know why either but I wish I would’ve found out earlier. When I speak with your accent I sound a lot less like a super white boy trying to learn hahaha. I always hated the way my Spanish accent sounded. It’s so bad

","[5/12/20, 4:28:58 PM] Joe: Well....you don’t have to put your life on pause for me. You’re a grown up and you have a life outside of talking to a stranger on the internet. Do whatever makes you happy. Just stay in touch and we’ll see what happens.

","[5/13/20, 5:01:11 PM] Joe: Hahah I guess it was kind rhetorical(?) like....it is probably the best way to learn. People learn the fastest when they go to a country that speaks the language they’re trying to learn
","[5/13/20, 5:04:20 PM] Joe: Haha no worries. By the way, I just got approved to follow that Instagram page that you tried to share with me from.

","[5/15/20, 11:25:12 AM] Joe: Damn... this is fucked. When the lockdown first happened in the US all they were saying was that we need to “flatten the curve” so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. They made it seem like if we just brought the number of cases down to a number the hospitals could handle it would be fine.
","[5/15/20, 11:27:19 AM] Joe: But now they’re making it seem like we’re locked down until it is gone completely or there is a vaccine or something. They keep moving the goalpost, which is annoying. 
","
","I just want to know what the data needs to look like before things go back to normal. They can’t keep changing the rules hahaha
","[5/15/20, 11:28:58 AM] Joe: Also the US is weird because the federal government might end the lockdown but individual states or cities can impose their own lockdowns so everything will open at different times across the country. 
","
","
","Haha sorry that was a lot 😂
","[5/15/20, 11:37:01 AM] Joe: What do you mean, “is there someone who is very interested”? Like, do I have a resource for you to read about it? Or are you saying that I’m interested in it because of how much I explained? Haha sorry 😐
","[5/15/20, 11:37:31 AM] Joe: The way the stories change isn’t very confidence inspiring haha
","[5/15/20, 11:38:45 AM] Joe: Same hahaha. I’m considered an “independent” in the US. Republicans and democrats both get mad at me cause I talk shit about both sides hahah. Liberals accuse me of being conservative and conservatives accuse me of being liberal but really I’m in the middle and think they’re all idiots hahaha
","[5/15/20, 11:40:32 AM] Joe: And the media is the fucking worst. Very biased and it’s super noticeable.
","[5/15/20, 11:42:02 AM] Joe: Aaaah ok. If you say it in English take of the “is”. It will sound/read more sarcastic or more like a joke. I don’t know why, but adding “is” makes it sound like a real question haha
","[5/15/20, 11:42:31 AM] Joe: Take off* the “if”
","[5/15/20, 11:42:36 AM] Joe: Fuck
","[5/15/20, 11:42:40 AM] Joe: “Is”*
","[5/15/20, 11:42:41 AM] Joe: Haha
","[5/15/20, 11:44:21 AM] Joe: If you say, “someone is interested in the topic??” It would be great. Add “mmm” at the beginning or “eh” at the end and you’re a native speaker haha
","[5/15/20, 11:46:01 AM] Joe: Haha no not too many. I don’t agree with conservatives or liberals on much so I just talk shot about everyone. I used to be a Democrat which would be liberal but they went fucking insane in the last few years so now I’m stuck in the middle
","[5/15/20, 11:47:04 AM] Joe: Oh yeaaaaahhhh
","[5/15/20, 11:47:12 AM] Joe: Perfecto
","[5/15/20, 11:48:00 AM] Joe: It’s been a long time since I watched the mainstream media. I get news from the internet hahah.
","[5/15/20, 11:50:41 AM] Joe: 🤔 I think having a strong family is important. That’s considered a conservative value here. 
","
","Other than that I’m not sure
","[5/15/20, 11:53:30 AM] Joe: I like to save money and I invest a lot of it. Not sure if that’s considered conservative haha
","[5/15/20, 11:54:54 AM] Joe: Strong family like you believe in family bond, maybe marriage, although to answer your other question, I’m not really religious. I believe there is something special spiritually about the universe and the world but I don’t believe in organized religion.
","[5/15/20, 11:55:44 AM] Joe: I’m not sure I even know what conservative values I have, if any, just that i disagree with the liberals often in this country.
","[5/15/20, 11:56:14 AM] Joe: I disagree with conservatives a lot too. I disagree with everything and everyone 😂
","[5/15/20, 11:58:13 AM] Joe: Everyone speaks in platitudes with no real solutions. They say things that sound nice and I hate it. 
","
","
","People all remind me of when I was in elementary school and we did a mock election....some of the kids “running” for president would say “I’ll put a candy machine in the hallway!” and they would win cause all the kids would believe the nice sounding bullshit hahaha
","[5/15/20, 12:00:10 PM] Joe: Haha I have too many thoughts on the subject of politics and media. Should not have got me started 😂
","[5/15/20, 12:06:05 PM] Joe: Are you asking if I have any ideas? Well first thing that needs to happen in the US is an end to the massive divide we have right now. If one side has an idea, even if it’s good, the other side opposes it for political posturing. Literally nothing good gets done because we’re split in half. 
","
","But after that if we’re all on one side we can look at the data objectively and use that to make decisions. Right now it looks like decisions are made for political purposes or based on feelings. Facts need to be the most important thing when considering anything. 
","
","Then since the money printers are going “brrrrrr” printing trillions of dollars...I would give that to the people in the form of universal basic income. It would be a trickle up stimulus package instead of the trickle down stuff we’re getting. We have massive unemployment and food banks are running out of food so I would put a lot of focus there
","
","
","I could go on for days about this hahahah so I’ll stop there
","[5/15/20, 12:14:48 PM] Joe: 🤔 most recently the super liberal people here supported Bernie Sanders. I did too in 2016 because he wanted healthcare for everyone. But looking at his policies this time around, he had things like a federal jobs guarantee, which sounds wonderful. Making sure everyone who is capable of working has a job...but there are too many problems with it that no one ever dealt with....who is in charge? How much does everyone get paid? What if you don’t like the federal job you’ve been guaranteed? What happens when a president like Trump is in charge of the federal jobs guarantee and makes his workforce “build the wall”? What about the people that are not capable of working?
","
","
","
","I’d say I’m way more liberal than conservative....it’s mostly that I don’t agree with the policy choices of the liberal politicians that I consider myself in the middle. 
","
","The so called liberals here want to give too much power to the government and the conservatives want the government to basically do nothing but help rich people.
","
","
","Okey sorry sorry. Please tell me a little about where you fall on the spectrum hahaha. What are you like?
","‎[5/15/20, 12:17:33 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/15/20, 12:27:27 PM] Joe: The normal people come last. Basically I aligned very well with this politician named Andrew Yang this year. He was like my dream candidate hahaha. Very focused on working based of hard numbers/data and had actual solution oriented policies that would help average people. He wrote a book called The War on Normal People. Excellent book 📚
","[5/15/20, 12:33:18 PM] Joe: That’s my duuuuuude! Hahaha
","[5/15/20, 12:36:26 PM] Joe: It’s weird. The states can do their own rules to make things stricter but not more relaxed than the federal government. Technically with marijuana laws a lot of states are breaking federal law but the federal government has mostly stopped enforcement on stores running legally in states.
","[5/15/20, 12:37:11 PM] Joe: Haha it’ll make more sense after the book
","[5/15/20, 12:38:52 PM] Joe: I thought his ideas were kind of crazy at first but I researched them quite a bit and they would theoretically work well and give a lot of power to regular people
","[5/15/20, 12:44:06 PM] Joe: 😂 😂 I’m fucking dead 💀
","[5/15/20, 12:44:12 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
","[5/15/20, 12:44:15 PM] Joe: Fuck
","[5/15/20, 12:47:29 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be great. But if you read the book and learn about automation coming it looks like one of the only smart things to do. 
","
","
","Amazon is starting to open stores that you walk in with your phone to check in, like getting on a subway with a pass that’s on your phone. Then you walk around and pick up what you want and leave. No cashiers. That’s one of the most common jobs here. Google is making a artificial intelligence telemarketer, that’s another common job. Basically automation will come over next 5-25 years and slowly take the most common jobs.
","[5/15/20, 12:52:55 PM] Joe: It’s fine. The technology is there. Whether it’s Amazon or someone else it’s inevitable and should actually be desirable. But we need to make sure people have money even if they have no work. Then we can automate and be very happy about it.
","[5/15/20, 12:54:02 PM] Joe: If people are scared of automation and job losses because they’ll have no money it will only slow us down as a society
","[5/15/20, 12:55:09 PM] Joe: Haha cool. I don’t want to sound like a crazy person 😂 
","
"," But I love technology so I see how close it is and he had very good solutions before it becomes a problem
","[5/15/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Universal basic income. Income not tied to what you do for a living. It’s like this....in the US there is a disagreement about minimum wage. Some think it should go up, others say it would kill small businesses because only big businesses can afford that. I understand both sides. People need more money, small businesses can’t afford it. Universal basic income.
","[5/15/20, 1:01:06 PM] Joe: You don’t. He would say, “we need to decouple human value from economic value and put the money directly in the people’s hands”
","[5/15/20, 1:02:05 PM] Joe: Exactly. We should. I want that. I want the future where humans can do less tedious task and have more time for living. But they’ll need money to live
","[5/15/20, 1:06:15 PM] Joe: And there will still be jobs and ways to move up the ladder in life but everyone will have at least a baseline of income to live from.

","He also gives many examples of people that aren’t valued economically today but do a lot of work we need. Stay at home parents, people that take care of loved ones, a lot of artist hahaha. Universal basic income gives those people something for contributing to society even if there is no way to make money from it.

","I don’t know. Seems like bullshit but amazon is close to eliminating retail, google is close to eliminating receptionist and telemarketers, telsa will get rid of the need for driving jobs. All relatively soon.

Also, if there was a universal basic income, people can be secure in doing what they love. Even if it makes less money than you could survive on without the basic income.

","[5/16/20, 3:56:35 PM] Joe: Haha alright I’ll believe you. Communication is definitely the key. Which makes this hard 😂 
","
","But people can communicate a lot with actions as well I guess
","[5/16/20, 4:02:44 PM] Joe: Hahah eh eh eh
","
","I’m very calm for the most part. I try to work situations out or just walk away and come back to it later. Depends. I’ve had my moments of getting very angry when I was younger for sure but as I got older I’ve become less worried about the things that upset me

","[5/17/20, 4:10:10 AM] Joe: Haha dude you have no idea how bad the US has been with all this do you?
","[5/17/20, 4:12:17 AM] Joe: We basically fucked the whole response and it’s been like this for most of the time with people not listening. But in different places across the country at different times.
","[5/17/20, 4:12:23 AM] Joe: Then we have weird enforcement where police will patrol poor neighborhoods and keep them on a much more serious lockdown than the rich neighborhoods
","[5/17/20, 4:14:03 AM] Joe: It’s the worst. Especially in places like New York
","[5/17/20, 4:15:12 AM] Joe: Yeah but the police let the rich gather in their parks and literally beat and arrest the poor for being outside in their neighborhoods
","[5/17/20, 4:16:21 AM] Joe: It’s so weird to see a video of cops assaulting someone for being outside without a mask...instead of maybe just giving them a mask
","[5/17/20, 4:16:47 AM] Joe: It doesn’t make sense cause now there are a bunch of cops touching this person to arrest them
","[5/17/20, 4:17:10 AM] Joe: They should be distancing themselves not touching people. Shits crazy
","[5/17/20, 4:17:38 AM] Joe: True
","[5/17/20, 4:20:20 AM] Joe: Hahaha
","[5/17/20, 4:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s what made one of the videos of a cop arresting someone for not having a mask so ridiculous. A few of the officers were wearing there mask like that haha
","[5/17/20, 4:23:01 AM] Joe: It’s impossible to get 100% of the humans to believe it all and to actively participate in keeping everyone safe. Some people just don’t trust sources of authority telling them what to do
","[5/17/20, 4:27:33 AM] Joe: Yeah the more we have stuff like that picture, the longer it will take to go to normal
","[5/17/20, 4:28:42 AM] Joe: Hopefully there are more people doing the right thing than the wrong thing. Around here most wear their mask and keep their distance. Beaches are mostly empty but I think they are starting to open them this week.
","[5/17/20, 4:29:32 AM] Joe: Oh and tell me what you thought about the video. I watched it again hahaha I forgot how old that video is
","[5/17/20, 4:34:10 AM] Joe: Yeah it seems a little weirder being in a bigger city. It’ll be an adjustment going back to California. There are a lot of people in the Bay Area.
","[5/17/20, 4:35:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I especially liked the medicine story. Doctors giving the patients the choice even though the doctor has the knowledge and the way medications are marketed
","[5/17/20, 4:37:30 AM] Joe: I don’t know....and I only have 3 weeks to find out. I might have a friend I can stay with if I can’t find anything.
","[5/17/20, 4:39:59 AM] Joe: 🤔 when I pick something I do a lot of research if it’s an expensive item. 
","If it’s something like choosing which bread from the store, I don’t know haha
","[5/17/20, 4:41:37 AM] Joe: Usually I just get the same thing every time once I find something I like. Then I don’t have to choose
","[5/17/20, 4:49:08 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I’m going to bed soon. But um...just deciding what to do with my life hahaha
","I don’t know how to explain it
","[5/17/20, 4:49:51 AM] Joe: Like my decision where to live, who to be, what things do I want to be able to say I’ve done when my life is over. The hard stuff haha

","[5/17/20, 1:55:10 PM] Joe: Haha with the scissors still in hand. Did you find those and cut them?
","[5/17/20, 1:56:43 PM] Joe: Haha I’m going to have to listen to that a bunch of times to get the whole thing but don’t translate it. I’ll use it to practice haha
","[5/17/20, 2:05:10 PM] Joe: Hahaha so I got the part about your friend and the nickname 😂 and that you went to see your friend and went for a long walk with the dog. The dog is super good? Haha
","[5/17/20, 2:07:00 PM] Joe: And you are getting a lot of flowers in nature because there are no gardeners hahah. Very nice.
","[5/17/20, 2:08:35 PM] Joe: Sweet. There are still a bunch of words I miss or don’t understand but I can get barely enough to make a story in my head about what you say 😂
","[5/17/20, 3:10:50 PM] Joe: Yeah that’ll be good. Enjoy dinner. I’m waiting for “Lahaina noon” where the sun is directly overhead and vertical objects have no shadow.

","[5/17/20, 4:56:05 PM] Joe: Hahaha I don’t know how to play but I think it’s fine. I like the discomfort. It’s more from not being used to getting compliments and literally not knowing how to respond 😂

","[5/17/20, 5:00:15 PM] Joe: If I do it’s not in a bad way. Don’t second guess how you’re talking to me...I think everything you’ve said has been fine

","[5/17/20, 5:10:20 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t know what i would do 😂 
","
","I’ve always been told I’m bad at taking compliments. I think i usually try to make a joke about it if you haven’t noticed
","[5/17/20, 5:11:50 PM] Joe: So I would probably joke about whatever compliment you give me then compliment you I guess 🤔 
","
","I’m not super smooth hahahahaha
","[5/17/20, 5:14:26 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck
","[5/17/20, 5:14:39 PM] Joe: Well what do normal people do?? Am I weird for that?
","[5/17/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Haha alright if you say so. I’ll just keep being my weird self since it seems to be working fine
","[5/17/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: I wish you could just have subtitles everywhere you went because I can understand you so much better with subtitles 😂 😂
","[5/17/20, 5:24:26 PM] Joe: So you can meet me sooner and I’ll understand you. You would have a little screen that shows subtitles for everything you say and you bring it everywhere hahah 
","
","I’m better at reading Spanish than listening to it for now

","[5/18/20, 11:50:18 AM] Joe: Mostly “Whaaaaat!? Hahaha, you’re always doing something hella cutty” which is kind of like saying that I’m always doing stuff without many knowing. And they talked about how I’m always doing the opposite of what they’re doing in life haha ever since high school
","[5/18/20, 11:51:17 AM] Joe: But they were stoked on it. A little concerned that I might leave the Bay Area for good but they know wherever I go they’re welcome to visit so it’s bittersweet I guess
","[5/18/20, 12:01:02 PM] Joe: Well when I first told them about you I said I was considering trying to see you. Maybe in Spain. They all traveled internationally without me a few years back. I was too busy working to go. Now it’s the opposite, I have time to travel and they’re all very busy. 
","
","And now I’m single, talking to some girl from across the world, and they all have girlfriends. But like i told you, I had a few very long term relationships, all while my friends were single hahaha. They all had long crazy hair in high school, i stayed clean cut.

","[5/18/20, 11:54:17 PM] Joe: Oh yeah making the little preview instead of the text showing up in the box took forever haha. Had to make the preview appear, then add a button to cancel if you don’t want to use the gif, and make sure if you choose another gif it replaces the current one and doesn’t add another preview
","[5/18/20, 11:54:41 PM] Joe: It was a little complicated and frustrating but I got it. 1/3 today 😂
","[5/18/20, 11:55:53 PM] Joe: Oh but if someone else joins they can’t see any chat that was written before they entered. Or if you rejoin, you won’t be able to see it. But it never gets deleted for anyone that stays in the game
","[5/19/20, 12:00:33 AM] Joe: No cause I’m not in the room now. So if I join i see a blank chat. And actually the room will be deleted when the last player is gone
","[5/19/20, 12:02:25 AM] Joe: Yeah it’ll be another thing to tack onto the resumé so that’s good. Plus it’ll make playing way more fun 😂
","[5/19/20, 12:02:46 AM] Joe: I sent a video to my friends, they were stoked on the new feature
","[5/19/20, 12:03:32 AM] Joe: But yeah it’s kind of crazy to think about how everything we use on the internet had to be made in a similar way. Just a bunch of code
","[5/19/20, 12:05:53 AM] Joe: Haha ok
","[5/19/20, 12:06:20 AM] Joe: Let’s play
","[5/19/20, 12:06:26 AM] Joe: I want to try it
","[5/19/20, 12:15:42 AM] Joe: Damn what happened? It’s stuck? Shit

","[5/19/20, 12:17:57 AM] Joe: I wonder why it didn’t work. I hope it doesn’t do that a lot to people haha
","[5/19/20, 12:19:17 AM] Joe: I could probably do both. Alright...added to the list
","[5/19/20, 12:23:13 AM] Joe: I don’t know hahah. You have access to GIPHY’s whole library of gifs. Probably the same that this app uses.
","[5/19/20, 12:23:31 AM] Joe: Facebook just bought GIPHY this week and the own WhatsApp
","[5/19/20, 12:24:57 AM] Joe: Hahaha i wonder what kind of gifs your mom likes? 😂 
","
","I always think about sending my mom a meme or gif but I rarely do
","[5/19/20, 12:28:35 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good. I need to teach my mom to use them. I’m interested to see what she would send.
","[5/19/20, 12:36:56 AM] Joe: Hahahah “mister bean” “en google?” Hahaha
","[5/19/20, 12:38:23 AM] Joe: You need to teach her how to find the hidden gems 💎 I’ve been getting good with the gifs from talking to you 😂
","[5/19/20, 12:47:54 AM] Joe: Hahaha that’s good to know. I got points for the good gifs 😂 
","
","I’m becoming fluent in the language of gif as a backup in case I can’t learn Spanish. All communication will be with gifs only haha
","[5/19/20, 12:53:30 AM] Joe: Haha hair and pants are looking wild. I love it 😂
","[5/19/20, 1:18:20 AM] Joe: The skateboarding from earlier today wiped me out. I should’ve taken a nap.
","[5/19/20, 1:18:36 AM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if i pass out out of nowhere today haha
","[5/19/20, 1:18:43 AM] Joe: Mmmm
","[5/19/20, 1:21:53 AM] Joe: Haha I like the look very much. Nice and comfortable
","[5/19/20, 1:25:23 AM] Joe: Haha alright. Well I guess I’ll lay down. I’ll probably fall asleep instantly, I can feel it coming haha.
","[5/19/20, 1:26:31 AM] Joe: Have a good day, I hope the course goes well for you! 
","
","I’ll talk you you later 😘
","[5/19/20, 1:30:18 AM] Joe: Haha cool I’ll put it on
","[5/19/20, 1:30:56 AM] Joe: That’s me. But I’m not like super smart or anything hahah. Sounds cool. I’ll watch it
","[5/19/20, 1:35:23 AM] Joe: Same! I LOVE learning but college still was not the right choice for me and I’m glad i didn’t go. I would probably be in so much debt haha. Instead I have a nice little savings 👍
","[5/19/20, 1:36:18 AM] Joe: So far it’s working out. I know a lot of people that went to college but aren’t using their degrees in the end. 
","
","I’m happy with my decisions at the moment. Glad you’re on the same hype with taking your own path to learning
","[5/19/20, 1:42:03 AM] Joe: It only cost this dude $5,000 to stay in Argentina for 4 months. I should do that hahah
","[5/19/20, 1:46:12 AM] Joe: Yeah web development has many self taught people. It’s all about what you can do, so portfolios and projects are important. 
","
","Probably similar with the 3D modeling.
","[5/19/20, 1:47:26 AM] Joe: Hmm well I’m pretty flexible on lifestyle haha I don’t need much. 
","
","But I’ve been saving for a while so I’m ready to go on a trip like that 😂

","[5/19/20, 12:30:20 PM] Joe: Ok all done. Today the main thing I learned it the importance of the apostrophe haha.
","[5/19/20, 12:31:32 PM] Joe: Nelly told me about her friend that would get mad because people would write “Feliz ano nuevo” on Facebook without using the “ñ” hahaha

","[5/19/20, 1:52:54 PM] Joe: Hahaha there is a name for the dudes like me with the gold chain and stuff out here. I forgot what it was though
","[5/19/20, 1:57:33 PM] Joe: I’ll tell you what it is when I remember or I’ll ask my sister. I got this chain from Nelly probably 15 years ago. It has a pendant that is in the shape of Peru and says “PERU” across it. 
","
","The part that holds it to the chain broke so I have to get that fixed
","[5/19/20, 2:08:32 PM] Joe: Haha yeah she got it on a trip to Peru too so I really like it.
","[5/19/20, 2:08:49 PM] Joe: I’m going to take a shower really quick and I’ll redo the audio 🚿
","[5/19/20, 2:41:16 PM] Joe: Haha all the pictures of me at that age are mostly me in sports uniforms. Like baseball and soccer. The baseball ones are funny cause I wore a helmet that made my head look huge 😂

","[5/19/20, 3:22:01 PM] Joe: Gastón is out like a light hahaha

","[5/19/20, 3:36:57 PM] Joe: You’ll be disappointed with my pictures when I send them. I don’t think I have a lot of good ones. I’ll have to ask my parents to see if they’re hiding any.
","[5/19/20, 3:38:48 PM] Joe: So, right now I’m using these things to try and hear words better....music you sent me, la casa de Papel, and I’m watching a bunch of “Casi Creativo” videos hahaha

","If you have anything else I can listen to, send it

","[5/20/20, 3:52:59 PM] Joe: I mean my plan is basically what you described. Maybe I didn’t think it would be so many dogs and cats but “the more the merrier” as they say haha
","[5/20/20, 3:53:15 PM] Joe: Small house. Lots of land. Animals and nature
","[5/20/20, 3:57:14 PM] Joe: Haha wellll I really want my small house to be cute and inconspicuous. Look like a very old style, made by hand, but on the inside it will be like a smart house hahah. And I want to grow mangoes 🥭 and avocados 🥑 possibly coffee if the location is right for it. I also want a garden full of variety. Basically anything I can make grow well in the climate my house ends up in. There is a big difference between being up higher and being near the shore in terms of climate.
","[5/20/20, 3:57:39 PM] Joe: Most likely off grid with solar

","[5/20/20, 4:09:02 PM] Joe: Hahaha you don’t understand. I’ve been imagining this for a long time. I actually have been putting money away to make this dream real for me. I’m not going to take no for an answer from the world on this one.

","[5/20/20, 5:18:49 PM] Joe: Not at all. I love sex hahahah but only with a certain person or I can’t even enjoy anything
","[5/20/20, 5:19:39 PM] Joe: Definitely not asexual. Just.....really picky haha
","[5/20/20, 5:25:21 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised. I mean, a lot of people can sleep with people they’re only physically attracted to, even if they don’t have much of a connection and enjoy it a lot. I can’t do that.
","[5/20/20, 5:25:51 PM] Joe: Don’t worry. I would be all over you hahaha
","[5/20/20, 5:31:47 PM] Joe: I really like you. I don’t know how to make that clear without seeming weird hahaha 
","
","I like talking to you and hearing what you think about things. I enjoy your opinions on the world and I like the things you put value on in your life. Those are the things that attract me to people.
","[5/20/20, 5:32:57 PM] Joe: I would definitely be all over you. And I wouldn’t let you go.

","Seriously reconsider getting into anything with me unless you want to end up married 😂

","[5/20/20, 5:39:23 PM] Joe: That’s fine. Don’t need to get married then, but you’ll end up with me for a long ass time haha
","[5/20/20, 5:41:46 PM] Joe: Ok I’m sorry to keep you up with my crazy dreams of being together hahaha 
","
","maybe you should get some sleep so you’re ready for class tomorrow
","[5/20/20, 5:42:37 PM] Joe: Good cause I’m going to make it happen so I don’t want you to be too surprised

","‎[5/22/20, 2:40:33 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[5/22/20, 2:43:03 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll look at it more tomorrow. It might also be that you don’t have enough memory/RAM which is different than the long term storage in those drives. 
","
","RAM has a big impact on how fast programs can run. Not having enough will make it run slow.
","‎[5/22/20, 2:45:06 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[5/22/20, 2:46:17 AM] Joe: Specs look pretty good. Hmm, it only is running slow when you use that 3d program?
","[5/22/20, 2:47:32 AM] Joe: Or all the time? If it’s only with that program, it’s probably just a super memory intensive program.
","[5/22/20, 2:48:14 AM] Joe: I’m thinking that program is probably just insane with the amount of resources it needs. 3D rendering takes a lot of memory
","[5/22/20, 2:50:03 AM] Joe: I have to see if that laptop allows for you to upgrade the ram but you can go from the 16GB you have to 32GB and that might help
","[5/22/20, 2:52:31 AM] Joe: Yeah because that space that’s full is the long term storage. But i think the problem is with the short term memory/RAM
","[5/22/20, 2:53:19 AM] Joe: 30GB remaining right? Not 30GB RAM?
","[5/22/20, 2:53:39 AM] Joe: A good way to check would be to open the task manager when you’re using the program and see what it says
","‎[5/22/20, 2:54:48 AM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[5/22/20, 2:56:34 AM] Joe: Well it might not look like it’s in there but If you have any photos and videos they’re usually on the C drive. Just hard to find.
","[5/22/20, 2:57:54 AM] Joe: Open the task manager when you have the program open and see if you are using 100% of the memory. Also try not to have google chrome open while using the program cause chrome uses a lot of memory. Maybe try Firefox
","[5/22/20, 2:59:28 AM] Joe: Hahaha Ok now I really think it’s the RAM 😂
","[5/22/20, 2:59:45 AM] Joe: Delete
","[5/22/20, 3:00:11 AM] Joe: Control + alt + delete then open task manager to check on memory usuage
","[5/22/20, 3:00:20 AM] Joe: Usage*
","[5/22/20, 3:01:39 AM] Joe: Haha ok I’ll help tomorrow. I’m going to have to actually read up and make sure you get the right stuff. But it’s most likely not enough memory haha
","[5/22/20, 3:04:27 AM] Joe: Hmmm only 51% usage on your memory. Keep that open and if it starts going slow look at it and see if it is at or above 100%

","[5/22/20, 1:36:07 PM] Joe: I’m not sure hahah. Doctor says he can’t hear. And he supposedly doesn’t hear or mishears things often. But Nelly was saying she’ll tell him “food is ready” in a normal voice,  not even yelling, and he will come from across the house 😂

","[5/23/20, 5:58:34 AM] Joe: Also my dad was not a very affectionate guy haha. He would be the one to take me to do sports and all that but he was definitely one to fall in the background a bit. He worked hard though and I recognize that. 
","
","But I would like to show my children more affection. I can barely give my dad a hug without him being all weird about it
","[5/23/20, 6:15:30 AM] Joe: 😊
","[5/23/20, 6:16:53 AM] Joe: I really appreciate that haha cause I really want to be a good dad. I had the weirdest moment working at summer camp last year when I was helping some kid and I thought to myself, “damn I should be a dad or something” haha
","[5/23/20, 6:18:06 AM] Joe: I’m trying to teach my own kid how to skate...not everyone else’s hahaha
","[5/23/20, 6:23:50 AM] Joe: That does sound nice and I was not expecting you to say that haha
","[5/23/20, 6:25:12 AM] Joe: But thank you 😊 you seem like you’d be a great mom. I would definitely be stoked if you were my kids mom
","[5/23/20, 6:28:03 AM] Joe: Ok now I think I can go to sleep hahaha. i enjoyed our talk. Some good information here 😂

","[5/23/20, 1:14:10 PM] Joe: And good evening to you haha. 
","
","So I was wondering, are there any new updates on opening up over there?
","[5/23/20, 1:33:09 PM] Joe: Glad it’s a nice night. Enjoy it!
","[5/23/20, 1:33:53 PM] Joe: Yeah. There is just so much arguing and confusion in the US right now I was just wondering what kind of updates people are getting in other places
","[5/23/20, 1:36:58 PM] Joe: Hmm ok that sounds reasonable I guess. Everyone here is so divided here it’s hard to come up with a consensus for what we should do. Feels really weird.
","[5/23/20, 1:37:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah that runny nose 🤧 must be hellllllaaaa pollen out there
","[5/23/20, 1:47:24 PM] Joe: Hahahah damn the whole world is a fucking mess 😂 this shit is so weird. Aaaah can’t wait for it to be over
","[5/23/20, 1:52:26 PM] Joe: So many people. I’m not looking forward to going back to the Bay Area haha. Too many humans everywhere! Fuck
","‎[5/23/20, 1:53:10 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/23/20, 2:26:05 PM] Joe: I wish I could stay. I need to go back though. At least for a few months. Skate camp didn’t get cancelled and I need to film for my video part. 
","
","I’m just feeling a little weird about it though. I just need to stay focused for those few months and try to save up some more money.
","[5/23/20, 2:27:25 PM] Joe: I’m getting nervous though cause I’m having a hard time finding a place to stay but I already have my ticket back. Shiiiiiit
","[5/23/20, 2:37:09 PM] Joe: Yeah I was going to stay with my friend but he rented out his extra room a couple weeks back. Now I’m trying to find something
","[5/23/20, 2:39:57 PM] Joe: I just need a room to rent. But I’m not trying to pay crazy high rent or there is no point cause all the money I make will just go to rent. I’m trying to save up over the summer.
","[5/23/20, 2:41:36 PM] Joe: I was going to stay with a friend but they had to rent out their extra room cause they lost hours at work and needed money for rent now. They couldn’t wait until when I get back. 
","
","I don’t know. I’m just hoping I find something reasonable.
","[5/23/20, 2:47:34 PM] Joe: Hahahaha whaaaaat!? I should just go to Madrid instead. Renting a single bedroom in a house will most likely be $900-$1200 for me in the Bay Area. A house would be $2000-$4000 😂
","[5/23/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Yes. The Bay Area is absolutely insane with housing prices. It’s completely fucked.
","[5/23/20, 2:49:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[5/23/20, 2:51:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you can find some really high paying jobs there. My job is kind of in the middle of the pay rate though so I definitely struggle a little when I’m in the Bay Area but that’s true for a lot of people living there. So many big tech companies brought in a bunch of high paid software engineers and they made housing crazy expensive
","[5/23/20, 2:52:21 PM] Joe: That’s why I need a good deal on my housing to make it worth it haha.
","[5/23/20, 2:53:22 PM] Joe: Damn I can’t believe the housing prices out there. I wonder what it would cost to actually buy a property?
","
","I could live in Madrid in a house by myself for a year or two with just my savings hahaha
","[5/23/20, 2:54:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[5/23/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Yeah I think that’s the trend all over the world. People needed to stay with roommates or family for way longer than in the past
","‎[5/23/20, 2:56:49 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/23/20, 2:59:01 PM] Joe: Lol I guess I should think about leaving the US maybe. If I can keep saving at this rate I should be able to buy something cool in another country haha. But I’ll probably never be able to afford the Bay Area unless there is a housing crisis like the one in 2007/2008
","[5/23/20, 3:03:02 PM] Joe: Haha unless I end up with a rich wife it’s pretty reasonable thing to think. Go on Zillow or similar real estate website and look at prices near Oakland/San Francisco/Berkeley. Shits crazy
","[5/23/20, 3:05:43 PM] Joe: Hmmm maybe I’ll need to start thinking about places like this haha. I need to figure this shit out. I know the Bay Area is not my final destination
","[5/23/20, 3:06:22 PM] Joe: Oh I’m not counting on that hahaha. I’m just saying, I can’t afford shit as a single dude in the bay
","[5/23/20, 3:07:12 PM] Joe: If you stay really close to town and near the beach it could be similar to the Bay Area but if you find a place a little further out from people you can get good deals still
","[5/23/20, 3:10:53 PM] Joe: This place is like an apartment. 2 bedrooms and it has a little back patio area where we grow stuff. It’s about $1200/month but she has been living here for a while and kept her rate. If you move in today rent would be higher.
","[5/23/20, 3:13:02 PM] Joe: Yeah she has a good deal here. She’s not leaving any time soon hahah
","[5/23/20, 3:16:48 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn that’s a strange reason for housing to be filling up 😂 
","
","People couldn’t stand being locked in a house together
","[5/23/20, 3:23:03 PM] Joe: Hahahaha fuck

","[5/23/20, 3:31:17 PM] Joe: Probably happening here too I would imagine. Aaaah everything is so weird right now. Never would’ve imagined all this one year ago
","[5/23/20, 3:32:37 PM] Joe: My flight is on June 8. I have to do a 3 hour layover on another island before flying back into Oakland.
","[5/23/20, 3:32:57 PM] Joe: California is 3 hours ahead of Hawaii
","[5/23/20, 3:34:50 PM] Joe: I still can’t believe we’ve talked as much as we have with a 12 hour time difference haha it’s been fun though
","[5/23/20, 3:36:56 PM] Joe: Hahaha I can almost guarantee you’ll be the one who stops talking to me first 😂
","[5/23/20, 3:37:44 PM] Joe: 😂 yeah it did! You surprised me a few times with how late you stayed up talking to me. I felt bad haha
","[5/23/20, 3:40:05 PM] Joe: I don’t know. You’ll probably just get tired of me talking about my nerd shit hahaha
","[5/23/20, 3:44:55 PM] Joe: Haha ok I guess maybe you find some entertainment in my crap. I feel like I talk to much about me I don’t get to hear enough about you. Which is weird cause i don’t like telling people about me haha
","[5/23/20, 3:45:35 PM] Joe: I guess I just need to ask more questions if there is anything I want to know though. You’ve been pretty open about everything I ask so far
","[5/23/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Haha alright good. If you ever don’t want to hear about something I’m telling you feel free to use that phrase I taught you, “shut the fuck up Joe” 😂
","[5/23/20, 3:54:44 PM] Joe: Hahahah duuuude 😂 😂
","‎[5/23/20, 3:55:20 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/23/20, 4:03:12 PM] Joe: Can’t wait for the first time you actually use it. It’ll quickly become one of your most used phrases when talking to me haha
","[5/23/20, 4:08:43 PM] Joe: Haha I never come up with good phrases to teach. I’ll think about it and try to send some good ones but if there is a particular topic you need phrases for that could help me narrow it down
","[5/23/20, 4:08:58 PM] Joe: Analysis paralysis when deciding what phrases to tell you hahaha
","[5/23/20, 4:19:30 PM] Joe: Hahahah I’m struggling so much coming up with good stuff. I need a topic there is just too much to choose from
","[5/23/20, 4:20:59 PM] Joe: Here is a song while you wait for me to come up with something good. Random phrases are hard to think of. 
","
","https://youtu.be/D--ZSSFMsIg
","[5/23/20, 4:26:10 PM] Joe: It came on the radio when I was leaving the beach yesterday. “I wish you were here with me, on a beach in Hawaii”
","[5/23/20, 4:26:11 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
","[5/23/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: Ok that made me think of a phrase. “That song slaps” or “that shit was slappin’”
","
","Means like, the music is good
","[5/23/20, 4:27:49 PM] Joe: Oh and, “this shit smackin” is when food is hella good hahaha. I’ll just teach you Bay Area slang 😂
","‎[5/23/20, 4:28:51 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[5/23/20, 4:30:24 PM] Joe: Damn now I need to think of some other good bay slang. People say some funny shit out there
","[5/23/20, 4:32:16 PM] Joe: Oh you should say, “this song hella slaps” that would be straight out of Oakland haha
","[5/23/20, 4:35:58 PM] Joe: Yeah those are very specific slang that doesn’t mean anything in a translator Haha
","[5/23/20, 4:36:48 PM] Joe: But they’re used often in the bay. But if you go somewhere else people might look at you crazy and not know what you’re talking about haha
","‎[5/23/20, 4:39:13 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
","[5/23/20, 4:39:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m realizing I could talk slang to you and you would have no idea what I’m talking about
","[5/23/20, 4:40:38 PM] Joe: Sometimes people will put an “sh” sound on smackin’. Like “shamackin”
","[5/23/20, 4:40:53 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was shmackin” hahaha
","[5/23/20, 4:41:15 PM] Joe: “Breakfast was hella shmackin” hahah I’m going to send you audio of that
","‎[5/23/20, 4:41:27 PM] Joe: ‎audio omitted
","[5/23/20, 4:42:14 PM] Joe: Threw a “yo” at the end but it doesn’t mean anything hahaha. “Yo” is a weird slang word that’s hard to describe.
","[5/23/20, 4:43:12 PM] Joe: Haha don’t worry people only talk this way in specific neighborhoods. It’s not like the whole bay talks like that. It’s less and less common as locals move out of the bay
","[5/23/20, 4:44:31 PM] Joe: The rich software engineers that move to the bay from across the country definitely don’t talk that way haha.
","[5/23/20, 4:46:37 PM] Joe: Hahaha send me a bad audio clip I don’t mind. It doesn’t need to be perfect.
","[5/23/20, 4:47:10 PM] Joe: Say it like “that shit was slappen”
","[5/23/20, 4:47:41 PM] Joe: I bet if you say it like it has “en” at the end it’ll sound perfect
","[5/23/20, 4:47:43 PM] Joe: Hahaha siiiiii
","[5/23/20, 4:48:03 PM] Joe: Hella slappin yo
","[5/23/20, 4:48:25 PM] Joe: That sentence makes zero sense outside of slang hahaha
","[5/23/20, 4:49:38 PM] Joe: You’re going to speak English like you grew up in the hood
","[5/23/20, 4:50:41 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
","[5/23/20, 4:52:45 PM] Joe: Wow that got better really fast
","[5/23/20, 4:53:12 PM] Joe: The difference from the first audio to the last is quite a big difference haha. Nice
","[5/23/20, 4:53:32 PM] Joe: Hahahah ronronear boludo
","[5/23/20, 4:55:53 PM] Joe: Hahaha best way to relieve the frustration with a ronronear 😂
","[5/23/20, 5:00:24 PM] Joe: Hahahaha with the voice though 😂
","[5/23/20, 5:01:56 PM] Joe: Haha pretty good. You can leave off the “yo” and it’s the same shit. Or you could throw it at the beginning instead like “yooooo that was hella shmackin” 😂
","[5/23/20, 5:02:35 PM] Joe: It’s so funny to try to explain slang that I’ve heard and never really questioned whether or not it made sense. Cause it doesn’t make sense hahah
","[5/23/20, 5:03:35 PM] Joe: Maybe because when you eat really loud that sound can be called “smacking” sometimes. Who knows 🤷‍♂️
","[5/23/20, 5:04:39 PM] Joe: Haha I want you to say this to me if I make you a good breakfast. Please hahaha
","[5/23/20, 5:05:50 PM] Joe: Yeessss like that. Say that to me when I make you something good 😂
","[5/23/20, 5:06:54 PM] Joe: Haha not the most useful phrase but I’ll enjoy hearing it
","[5/23/20, 5:07:31 PM] Joe: Mostly used for good foods.
","[5/23/20, 5:08:16 PM] Joe: It can be used for other stuff but it’s harder to contextualize. Like you could say a house party was smackin
","[5/23/20, 5:10:09 PM] Joe: That’s the safest bet haha. Damn it’s going to be sooo long before you can say that to me in person haha fuck

","[5/23/20, 5:28:58 PM] Joe: Of course. I was planning on doing it in California but maybe I should just see if I can do it online out here haha
","[5/23/20, 5:30:34 PM] Joe: Honestly i would love to do it I’m not even joking
","‎[5/23/20, 5:31:46 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[5/23/20, 5:33:27 PM] Joe: You know but seriously, it would probably take 2 months to get a passport and id need to get a ticket so it could be 3, maybe 4 total. I think if we’re still talking at that time we should really talk about what the plan should be. Unless you just want to talk to me from far away forever haha I hope that’s not the case
","[5/23/20, 5:34:38 PM] Joe: I mean, we should plan sooner rather than later but I’m just saying....I’m willing to take a chance and go anywhere, do anything, and just spend some time with you
","[5/23/20, 5:35:05 PM] Joe: Cause it sounds like fun and it would make for a good story no matter what happens in the end haha
","[5/23/20, 5:39:47 PM] Joe: Haha fooled me for a second.
","[5/23/20, 5:40:04 PM] Joe: I understand the nervous joke. I’m all about the nervous joke hahah that’s my shit
","[5/23/20, 5:41:54 PM] Joe: Hey I’m getting better fast ok. I still have 3-4 months to improve haha
","[5/23/20, 5:45:37 PM] Joe: Haha ok I understand. I don’t really know what to say so I’m just going to say nothing at all 😂
","[5/23/20, 5:49:26 PM] Joe: Haha ok we’ll see how you feel in another month.

","[5/24/20, 3:26:43 AM] Joe: Haha I’m not going to fall asleep though. I’m just drowsy. My nap was too long to fall asleep right now
","[5/24/20, 3:27:25 AM] Joe: But....I would say you should try to do the things that the 3dsmax website suggested
","[5/24/20, 3:29:48 AM] Joe: The docs for 3dsmax have a whole thing about performance issues and possible fixes.

","[5/24/20, 11:34:57 AM] Joe: Hola! Any luck with getting your program to not run hella slow?
","
","I found a free spanish course online so I’m starting that today haha
","[5/24/20, 11:53:49 AM] Joe: Bahahah 😂
","[5/24/20, 11:55:25 AM] Joe: Uuuh definitely interested. Pass me the link! Mine is just “basic spanish” on this website EDX. https://www.edx.org
","[5/24/20, 11:58:50 AM] Joe: Yeah EDX is a big website. I’ve taken other courses on it for programming. You can take courses from places like Harvard for free on that site
","[5/24/20, 12:00:08 PM] Joe: But I’ll still check out busuu. The more content the better. Let’s me see the same thing explained in different ways
","[5/24/20, 12:02:13 PM] Joe: Edx.org/schools-partners
","[5/24/20, 12:02:38 PM] Joe: You can take a lot of the courses for free on EDX but you don’t get a certificate
","[5/24/20, 12:06:37 PM] Joe: Truuueee. I’ve never paid for any of the courses from EDX. I just need the knowledge not the paper haha
","[5/24/20, 12:08:27 PM] Joe: Sweet. I’ll check this out. I would like to have my own courses online eventually. I don’t even know what I’d teach haha but it’d be cool to share something I know and make a few bucks doing it.
","[5/24/20, 12:20:56 PM] Joe: Hahah I had to practice to get comfortable with a camera. I actually really don’t like it 😂 
","
","But it’s a great way to communicate with a larger audience on the internet nowadays. Have to take advantage of it while you can
","[5/24/20, 12:26:12 PM] Joe: Damn...I really appreciate that. You’re the best
","[5/24/20, 12:27:42 PM] Joe: Hahaha that’d be hella good. Making YouTube videos is pretty fun. I was started to make a few bucks off of them from my skateboard channel before they changed the rules hahah. I should get back on that and get that passive income flowing
","[5/24/20, 12:28:54 PM] Joe: The only thing is you have to make a video almost everyday or your channel doesn’t get much traction. It’s really not that hard to get it going though if you can come up with some decent content and you’re active in an online community like a forum or something related to the topic of your channel
","[5/24/20, 12:36:53 PM] Joe: Going viral isn’t too important. It’s more about getting a solid base of subscribers that watch all your stuff. An occasional viral video will help grow the channel faster but not really necessary.
","[5/24/20, 12:36:59 PM] Joe: Yeaaah I really should’ve started making videos when I came out here but I don’t have a camera anymore cause mine broke haha.
","[5/24/20, 12:37:23 PM] Joe: Hahahah thanks for subscribing 😂
","[5/24/20, 12:37:34 PM] Joe: Don’t forget to smash that like button hahaha
","[5/24/20, 12:39:16 PM] Joe: Yeah you make more from a viral video but the real key is building a consistent library of videos. Viral videos only help so much because a lot of the people that find them aren’t really that interested in the content of the channel but just that specific video.
","[5/24/20, 12:40:29 PM] Joe: I can’t do it haha I really notice the quality. Especially if things like the audio so I need a microphone like I was using before. But iPhone video quality should work fine.
","[5/24/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck
","[5/24/20, 12:41:26 PM] Joe: You’d be surprised how many people comment on a video with bad quality saying it needs to improve
","[5/24/20, 12:42:35 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’ll probably never post to the RC channel again 😂 but thanks for subscribing haha
","[5/24/20, 12:44:25 PM] Joe: You get paid per view. What category the content is determines how much you get per view. Pretty sure technology videos and makeup videos get the highest pay per view on YouTube.
","[5/24/20, 12:45:40 PM] Joe: Hahahaha good, I’m glad you hate them. But just know, they make a lot of money from those 😂
","[5/24/20, 12:46:22 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that sounds annoying
","[5/24/20, 12:46:46 PM] Joe: I’m going to make you a YouTube channel one of these days 😂 you’ll have to learn to be in front of the camera haha
","[5/24/20, 12:51:42 PM] Joe: Haha its pretty hard to come off natural when making a YouTube video 😂 
","
","You know what I would watch? Two people living together that don’t speak the same language. 
","
","Not saying we should do this but I’d watch it hahah
","[5/24/20, 12:53:25 PM] Joe: Hahahah we’ll make the “two people that don’t understand each other travel the world together” channel. 
","
","Probably get some pure gold out of that haha
","[5/24/20, 12:58:30 PM] Joe: That’s because I film them when I’m by myself mostly. That’s when I’m in my natural element. When no one is around hahaha
","[5/24/20, 1:00:53 PM] Joe: I’m telling my friends you said I’m the king of YouTube hahahah. I’ve tried to convince them for years that we should be making short YouTube videos. 1 or 2 a week would’ve been enough to build a decent channel. And if everyone actually did their part it’d be easy. 
","
","They didn’t believe you could make money though. Even when I showed them I was starting to make money haha. Before they changed the rules, now you need 1000+ subscribers before they pay you for views
","[5/24/20, 1:01:27 PM] Joe: Hahahahah
","[5/24/20, 1:02:15 PM] Joe: Dude....we’re going to have to make that video. If we get the plans to see each other settled I’ll start documenting more to make something. Even if it’s just for us to look back on and enjoy
","[5/24/20, 1:04:40 PM] Joe: Don’t be surprised if I ask you to record a video with your thoughts about something haha
","‎[5/24/20, 1:06:30 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[5/24/20, 1:09:17 PM] Joe: There is so much different stuff going on between the states. Some states are super strictly locked down while others are not taking it as seriously. This is in the state of Missouri yesterday
","[5/24/20, 1:24:54 PM] Joe: Damn that was a pretty good video. Little dude is hella cool. Thanks for sending that. Really interesting
","[5/24/20, 1:27:52 PM] Joe: Half of my country thinks the disease is a hoax or that it is being blown out of proportion by the media
","[5/24/20, 1:28:49 PM] Joe: I understand some of the doubt. At the beginning our government and media were telling us things like, “there is no proof it can be transmitted between people” and “wearing a mask doesn’t help” before reversing and saying the opposite and mandating that everyone wear a mask
","
","So much bad information is causing confusion and leaving doubt in people’s mind about needing to follow the rules
","[5/24/20, 1:29:19 PM] Joe: Plus America has always been full of people with a, “don’t tell me what to do” attitude. Our country was founded on that attitude haha
","[5/24/20, 1:30:16 PM] Joe: But that doesn’t mean they aren’t a bunch of dummies. Cause they are and they’re making things worse. But I understand, somewhat, their mindset, even though I don’t agree with it
","[5/24/20, 1:39:08 PM] Joe: Yeah suicides are waaaaay up here in the US right now and businesses are closing fast
","[5/24/20, 1:41:37 PM] Joe: I don’t know it just seems messed up. Like a lot of big chain stores remained open while the mom and pop stores were forced to close. The virus is real and terrible but the economic impact is going to last a loooong time. 
","
","So many jobs lost which will lead to more depression and suicides. They need to start giving people money because many have nothing and there is no end in sight.
","[5/24/20, 1:43:27 PM] Joe: True. But I don’t expect 100% of people or even close to 100% of people to comply
","
","
","Humans vary so much in their thinking and value systems that this kind of dysfunction is almost to be expected when trying to get everyone on the same page
","[5/24/20, 1:53:36 PM] Joe: Haha I don’t understand how this plan works? They want people to travel but they don’t have money to travel hahaha
","[5/24/20, 1:54:04 PM] Joe: Oook enjoy dinner. I’ll talk to you later 😚
","[5/24/20, 1:54:46 PM] Joe: 🤷‍♂️

","[5/24/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha what if I was bad at sending gifs from the start? Would that have been a deal breaker?
","[5/24/20, 3:16:15 PM] Joe: Hahah damn good thing I didn’t pick a bunch of stupid gifs at first 😂 
","
","I’ll send the bad ones when it’s too late to change your mind hahaha
","[5/24/20, 3:16:56 PM] Joe: Haha yeah I totally get it. I feel the same way. If the humor doesn’t connect it’s hard to just be relaxed and have fun talking

","[5/24/20, 3:54:06 PM] Joe: Have you ever seen a kangaroo up close? I’ve never seen one. Doesn’t look like a good idea to get too close to them haha

","I told my friends that I’m talking to you and that I really want to meet you, but not much else. They don’t ask many questions though so that’s part of it
","[5/25/20, 2:28:17 PM] Joe: Hahah niiiice. Yeah I’m definitely trying to come out there. I tried to start my passport shit the other day but I need to do it in person with certain paperwork that I don’t have with me here.
","[5/25/20, 2:29:22 PM] Joe: I’d probably tell a few of my really close friends more details if I was having a one on one type of conversation but it gets weird telling all of my friends at once in a group chat 😂

","It reminds me of these skate shoes from hella long ago that used to have a little pocket in the shoe. Only big enough for stuff like bags of weed haha

","[5/26/20, 2:24:17 AM] Joe: But you’re right. Everyone has a different accent. Trying to at least get close though haha

","[5/26/20, 2:28:35 AM] Joe: That’s true haha alright I won’t put too much thought into the accent. If you hear something that’s waaaay off I need you to say something though haha

","[5/26/20, 12:13:27 PM] Joe: Haha I think I get it. Hippie isn’t the most positive term around here haha. But I know what you mean when you say it
","[5/26/20, 12:15:13 PM] Joe: Languages are so weird. I’ve been thinking lately about how imprecise they are sometimes. Words are like an abstraction of feelings so sometimes it’s hard to describe a word, especially with a language barrier 😂

","[5/26/20, 12:29:49 PM] Joe: I like their music, but I’m not sure they’d like the random shit I listen to sometimes haha. I’m like a jukebox with every genre in it and it’s set to play random music

","[5/26/20, 12:37:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha I mean I can do that. It would just be all over the place. Some stuff you’ll like, like the things I sent you already, and some stuff you’ll hate 🤷‍♂️

","I’m weird about music. Sometimes I’ll like a song because I heard it at a certain time, even if I usually wouldn’t like it. Same with when I like a song from a skate video I wouldn’t normally listen to.
","[5/26/20, 12:38:12 PM] Joe: It’s about the feeling or memory the song gives me more than the actual song itself sometimes
","[5/26/20, 12:45:30 PM] Joe: Haha now just imagine if instead of getting songs from people in Uruguay, you got songs from the people in the Bay Area that say, “this shit slaps” 😂 😂

","[5/28/20, 5:59:46 AM] Joe: And I went a little slow
","[5/28/20, 6:00:37 AM] Joe: I also messed up in there somewhere haha. If I said it fast and loud without reading it I would probably do horribly 😂 
","
","Good practice though hahah
","[5/28/20, 6:01:00 AM] Joe: You’ll have to do “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” hahah
","[5/28/20, 6:02:33 AM] Joe: Hahaha niiiiice! I found the whole thing. I’m going to try it haha 
","“She sells seashells by the seashore.

","[5/28/20, 11:11:56 AM] Joe: George Floyd
","[5/28/20, 11:12:51 AM] Joe: Yeah some insane stuff happening right now. Los Angeles had some protest on the freeway yesterday too.
","[5/28/20, 11:17:54 AM] Joe: Yeah the video went viral and it shows the officer with his knee on the mans neck for 9+ minutes. The man at the beginning was saying he can’t breathe and by the end was dead. 
","
","Because he was suspected of using a fake $10 bill. He died over a piece of paper

","[5/28/20, 11:35:12 AM] Joe: It’s super messed up. And it really feels like nothing will change. That’s probably how the people that are setting things on fire and destroying stuff feel. Like it’ll never change
","[5/28/20, 11:40:39 AM] Joe: No. There is nothing happening here for protest or anything. I guess a part of the problem is the country being so big.

","[5/28/20, 11:47:32 AM] Joe: I’ll be ok. It’ll just be one uncomfortable day
","[5/28/20, 11:48:21 AM] Joe: I mean, I checked for other flights and there aren’t any going out. This was the one. Unless I want to wait until July
","[5/28/20, 11:49:04 AM] Joe: I’m not really too upset about it hahah. It’s going to be annoying but it’s ok.

","[5/28/20, 11:52:41 AM] Joe: It’d be funny if we were going on a trip together and something like this happened with the tickets. You’d probably be calling and trying to fix it...and I’ll just be saying, “honey it’s fiiiiine, no big deal”

","I’ll barely understand anything and not be able to form great responses. It’s really not going to be easy at first and might feel really strange.

","
","I’m willing to work through all that and I’m trying to be upfront about the reality of how hard it might be since it’ll take time

","[5/29/20, 12:08:16 AM] Joe: I honestly wouldn’t mind not being able to communicate in person compared to on the phone. I think I can figure out how to get the idea across for most things in person but on the phone it’s all verbal.

","[5/29/20, 12:45:56 PM] Joe: That’s why people send “fishing emails”. A fake email that looks real and ask for your info. Then instead of sending it to the bank or internet service provider or whatever, the info goes to the hacker dude haha
","[5/29/20, 12:49:01 PM] Joe: If the password is halfway decent no program can guess it in a reasonable time.

","[5/30/20, 1:56:51 PM] Joe: Ooh that sounds like my favorite kind of place. With no people haha. So weird that they let you go to a bar but not into nature. A bar seems much more likely to get you sick than sunbathing at a cool spot like that. I hope they don’t catch you hahah

","[5/30/20, 2:50:55 PM] Joe: Hmm....if you feel like continuing to talk to me is too much effort or you’re just not into it anymore for whatever reason, I want you to communicate that to me

","[5/31/20, 4:45:48 PM] Joe: We also have a building that has games and stuff in it but I’m not sure how much we’ll be using that stuff this year. It’s going to be really weird, with a bunch of special rules this year.
","[5/31/20, 4:51:04 PM] Joe: I think they’re going to limit it to 10 children per “session”. The sessions used to be 1 week but now I think they’ll be 2 or 4 weeks so that the kids aren’t switching camps as often.
","[5/31/20, 4:52:27 PM] Joe: I’m wondering how much staff they’ll give us though. Last year we had the bare minimum. We definitely could’ve used one more staff member. 
","
","But now since we get less kids, I’m sure they’ll try to give us less staff again
","[5/31/20, 4:58:54 PM] Joe: Hahah I hope a lot of kids sign up. I’m pretty sure we can get at least 10 haha.
","[5/31/20, 4:59:21 PM] Joe: I don’t know how many teachers we get. Hopefully 3. They’ll probably try to make us do it with 2(me and one other)
","[5/31/20, 5:47:34 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. As long as this one kid from last year doesn’t come it’ll be all good 😂
","[5/31/20, 6:06:08 PM] Joe: Oook talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
","[6/1/20, 5:21:12 AM] Joe: Damn was I must’ve fallen asleep so early to not see your messages. I’m sorry. Good afternoon haha
","[6/1/20, 5:22:51 AM] Joe: You’re hella sweet. I miss talking to you too babe. I’ll be up in a few hours I’m sure haha. Ok I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soooon 😘

","[6/1/20, 10:58:01 AM] Joe: Hahaha I definitely noticed that part. His accent reminds me of some of the cartoon characters that are in those casi creativo videos 😂 Hard to hear him super well though.
","[6/1/20, 11:03:44 AM] Joe: Hahaha woah 😱
","[6/1/20, 11:08:27 AM] Joe: I was a little worried at first until he started laughing hahah what a tumble

","
","I hope California isn’t too fucked up when I get back haha. The Bay Area has definitely been torn apart

","[6/1/20, 12:54:17 PM] Joe: Aún no. Voy a llamar por la tarde.
","[6/1/20, 12:58:11 PM] Joe: I wanted to ask you something...I heard in a video that people say “voy a la calle” or “vamos a la calle” for saying they are going out or let’s go out(with no specific place in mind). 
","
","Is that true? What do you say?
","[6/1/20, 12:59:05 PM] Joe: For example, is “voy a ir a la calle a patinar” correct?
","[6/1/20, 1:02:10 PM] Joe: I guess I could just just say it as “voy a patinar” to make it easy. But I still want to know if the other way is technically correct haha
","[6/1/20, 1:34:59 PM] Joe: Haha cool. Gracias
","[6/1/20, 1:35:22 PM] Joe: Well I did go skate but I didn’t make it far before my bearing broke so now my wheel doesn’t turn. Had to walk back
","[6/1/20, 1:39:18 PM] Joe: I was so close to making it back without anything breaking haha. The metal parts were getting rusty so it was only a matter of time I guess
","[6/1/20, 1:43:08 PM] Joe: Haha maybe I’ll have to see if the skate shop is open. 
","
","Good thing I didn’t get too far before the wheel broke. That would’ve sucked.
","[6/1/20, 1:43:26 PM] Joe: I have to write this down in my notebook haha
","[6/1/20, 1:44:33 PM] Joe: Anytime you notice a phrase I would use with you often or one you would use all the time with me, tell me the right way and I’ll write it down haha
","[6/1/20, 1:48:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[6/1/20, 1:48:51 PM] Joe: Damn these are funny haha you don’t have to come up with them right away 😂 😂
","[6/1/20, 1:48:57 PM] Joe: Hahah you have so many already
","[6/1/20, 1:49:01 PM] Joe: Niiice
","[6/1/20, 1:50:08 PM] Joe: Well I guess I should switch it up. Surprise you hahah shit
","[6/1/20, 1:51:04 PM] Joe: Oh god hahaha
","[6/1/20, 1:51:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha fuck I can’t believe you still talk to me since these are the things I say
","‎[6/1/20, 1:52:02 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[6/1/20, 1:55:43 PM] Joe: Ok I didn’t think you’d have so many haha. This gets a new page in the notebook.
","[6/1/20, 1:56:54 PM] Joe: Yeah you remembered a lot of stuff haha. I’m a little surprised
","[6/1/20, 1:58:45 PM] Joe: Still need stuff you say to me all the time ...or stuff you would say all the time if we we’re in the same place for example. 
","
","But this is a good start
","[6/1/20, 2:05:16 PM] Joe: Haha I remember things we talked about more than specific phrases. You are more unpredictable than me with 1000 more words 😂
","[6/1/20, 2:09:44 PM] Joe: But I guess what I really want is phrases you would say often if we were together. Simple everyday stuff like asking if I can get you something or if I want to do some activity or go somewhere with you. 
","
","Basic phrases that might be used daily. Maybe like something you would say to your roommates or friends often.
","[6/1/20, 2:10:57 PM] Joe: Not now though haha. Just think about it and if you notice a phrase being used often throughout the day, even if it seems basic to you, tell me what it is. Then I can work on different responses
","[6/1/20, 2:53:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah those are good. Stuff like that. That way i can think about and practice different responses until it is more natural

","[6/1/20, 3:36:20 PM] Joe: Since I’m the kind of person that only talks to a few people, it is especially frustrating for me that my favorite person to talk to has the most barriers for communication haha
","[6/1/20, 3:42:23 PM] Joe: Hahaha Lo siento 😂
","[6/1/20, 3:44:07 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate it. I want to be with you so bad, but I’ll keep my mushy bullshit to a minimum so you can sleep haha

","[6/1/20, 4:27:47 PM] Joe: Haha nice. I feel like this is me too. I lay down and pass out super fast most of the time. I sleep so fast I need to be careful with getting to comfortable or I’ll fall asleep on accident 😂
","[6/1/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: I’ve been trying to watch movies lately and I keep falling asleep hella early on the couch
","[6/1/20, 4:31:51 PM] Joe: Hah why? Will you fall asleep too? Sounds great haha
","[6/1/20, 4:33:25 PM] Joe: Don’t ever feel bad. My sleep schedule is super random sometimes but I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a while and that’s when I see those messages. I don’t mind waking up to a message from you at all. Sometimes I feel bad for not being able to respond cause I was asleep haha
","[6/1/20, 4:34:02 PM] Joe: Perfect. If we want to get a little nap we’ll just put on a movie and cuddle on the couch haha
","[6/1/20, 4:35:03 PM] Joe: I wouldn’t mind you falling asleep haha no biggie

","[6/2/20, 6:10:15 PM] Joe: Ok I’ll explain but don’t take it the wrong way because I love who you are as a person. Genuinely. 
","
","You are a beautiful, free spirited, outgoing, funny girl and I sometimes I feel like I could be setting myself up for heartbreak here hahaha
","[6/2/20, 6:11:38 PM] Joe: It’s less about me thinking you would do something inappropriate and more that I think I could end up liking you a little too much and get hurt for it. That’s life though, I either open up to you and see what happens or stay in my shell. The stay in the shell option might not be available to me anymore haha
","[6/2/20, 6:16:25 PM] Joe: I never know if I explain these things well that’s why I say never mind 😂 I don’t know how to describe what I mean. I hope you get the idea
","[6/2/20, 6:21:06 PM] Joe: Yeah I guess I’m just nervous about relationships in general. In that one video I sent you I told you I was planning on focusing on myself and wasn’t trying to talk to anyone like that. I don’t know how to describe it well
","[6/2/20, 6:21:55 PM] Joe: I’m super glad I’m talking to you now. And I don’t want to stop or anything like that. I’m just saying that I wasn’t really expecting something like this
","[6/2/20, 6:22:35 PM] Joe: I think the way previous relationships have ended make me a little guarded right now
","[6/2/20, 6:26:07 PM] Joe: Fuck I really don’t want you to think anything negative about this cause it’s not like some huge deal, I’ve still been super open with you and share as much as I can. If any of that was too big of a deal for me I wouldn’t even be talking to you. It’s a small thing. I’m sure you feel a slight nervousness about getting hurt in the end as well but that’s the risk you take if you want to be with someone
","[6/2/20, 6:28:33 PM] Joe: Hahah fuck 3:30am 😬 I’m so sorry 😂
","[6/2/20, 6:29:13 PM] Joe: You can respond to this tomorrow if you want. No worries

","[6/2/20, 6:31:00 PM] Joe: Haha it’s complicated. We can talk about it some other time. It’s not a huge deal at all. Don’t worry
","[6/2/20, 6:32:16 PM] Joe: Ok. Hmm I don’t know how to explain it in simple terms.
","[6/2/20, 6:34:24 PM] Joe: Haha why couldn’t you just accept “never mind” 😂
","[6/2/20, 6:36:13 PM] Joe: Hhahhha fuck
","[6/2/20, 6:36:16 PM] Joe: 😂
","[6/2/20, 6:37:01 PM] Joe: Ok I just had a bad breakup or two and I don’t want to go through that with you. I’m scared of having really strong feelings for you
","[6/2/20, 6:37:39 PM] Joe: There isn’t much more to it than that
","[6/2/20, 6:41:21 PM] Joe: At this point I can’t do anything about it cause I already really like you soooo
","[6/2/20, 6:42:59 PM] Joe: Ok 🙄
","[6/2/20, 6:44:30 PM] Joe: Nah but for real...it’s not being nervous about being with you, it’s being nervous about losing you. I fucking hate sounding corny like that but that’s what it is
","[6/2/20, 6:49:50 PM] Joe: This is why I shouldn’t tell you shit haha. I want to take it seriously with you, otherwise I wouldn’t be nervous at all. It wouldn’t matter. I’m sorry if what I’m saying is making you think I’m having doubts about trying to be with you because that’s not it
","[6/2/20, 6:51:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha yeah I also was very ok with being single. But I would say you trapped me 😆

","[6/2/20, 6:57:27 PM] Joe: You must be some kind of “hopeless romantic” haha. I like the story too and you got siiick vibes haha
","[6/2/20, 6:59:30 PM] Joe: Haha damn sorry about that 😂

","I didn’t plan on it at first either. Honestly I was very skeptical about your reason for messaging me haha. But the more I talked to you the more I wanted to meet you.
","[6/2/20, 7:00:09 PM] Joe: Then I started to think about it and there is nothing stopping me from making it happen, it’ll just take some time to get everything situated
","[6/2/20, 7:03:27 PM] Joe: Haha I’m not changing my mind on us meeting. That’s the goal right now.
","[6/2/20, 7:05:04 PM] Joe: When I get back to the bay I’m going to go do everything to get my passport and by the time that comes I should be able to visit you
","[6/2/20, 7:06:59 PM] Joe: I don’t even know what the plan would be. Like how long do I go and how it all works haha but I’ll figure it out.

","[6/2/20, 7:24:13 PM] Joe: You probably thought I was saying I don’t want to meet you or something haha. Damn I bet all that sounded so weird when you read it
","[6/2/20, 7:24:39 PM] Joe: Don’t get confused. I want to meet you and I’ll be very direct about it if that changes.
","[6/2/20, 7:24:42 PM] Joe: But it won’t haha

","[6/2/20, 9:13:44 PM] Joe: Sleep well babe. I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
","[6/3/20, 12:01:58 PM] Joe: I just saw a mosquito in my room! I tried to kill it but I missed and now I can’t see it. Little fucker has probably been biting me for days!
","[6/3/20, 12:24:39 PM] Joe: Haha yeah mosquito are terrible. That’s why I like those carnivorous plants. Nature’s mosquito trap haha
","[6/3/20, 12:25:09 PM] Joe: I sleep pretty good. Didn’t fall asleep on the couch so that probably helped.
","[6/3/20, 2:44:29 PM] Joe: Oooh it was good. I didn’t take many notes today. Just listened to Nelly talk about when she moved to the US in the 60s. Interesting stuff haha
","[6/3/20, 3:07:40 PM] Joe: Haha yeah this was me today. All kinds of stuff about not speaking English, having to sit in the back of the bus, crazy neighbors
","[6/3/20, 3:07:44 PM] Joe: Good stuff
","[6/3/20, 3:16:16 PM] Joe: Yeah she tells me everything in spanish but when I don’t understand she can explain in English
","[6/3/20, 3:21:56 PM] Joe: Hmmm what to tell you 🤔
","[6/3/20, 3:24:27 PM] Joe: Hahah I really don’t know what to tell you in spanish cause I didn’t write much down. I have a hard enough time translating it in my head. I can remember what she said but in my head it’s in english. I couldn’t tell you the exact phrases in Spanish unless I use the translator 🤦‍♂️
","[6/3/20, 3:25:39 PM] Joe: I still don’t hear or understand every word so I can only piece together the idea of what is being said.

","[6/3/20, 3:29:32 PM] Joe: Haha for sure. I’ll get it down
","[6/3/20, 3:30:13 PM] Joe: So what time did you wake up today? You stayed up helllla late haha. Sun was probably coming up as you went to sleep
","[6/3/20, 4:03:36 PM] Joe: Haha I had to listen so many times! You didn’t nap?? I would have haha
","[6/3/20, 4:03:38 PM] Joe: You should send videos or audio to me everyday until I don’t have to listen multiple times to understand hahah.
","[6/3/20, 4:16:48 PM] Joe: Haha I appreciate the subtitles. I understood the ideas like waking at 9, the dog crying at the door, coffee and toast with your friends for breakfast, 3d course, no nap and shower haha
","[6/3/20, 4:17:44 PM] Joe: I miss a bunch in between and I don’t hear a lot of the words but I kind of know what you say. Good to be able to read it so I can catch all the words
","[6/3/20, 4:21:48 PM] Joe: Yeah we’ll wait until I’m a little better at spanish before you send the videos after drinking coffee
","[6/3/20, 4:22:19 PM] Joe: Oh god I can only imagine what it sounds like when you talk really fast. Blahblahblahblah I wouldn’t understand shit
","[6/3/20, 4:26:38 PM] Joe: If you spoke English it would be so easy for me to learn from you hahah. I feel like I can understand Nelly waaaaay better after a few weeks of talking almost everyday
","[6/3/20, 4:28:39 PM] Joe: Now I really have to expand my vocabulary, because I’ll end up understanding most of a sentence but not knowing one or two words throws me off haha.  But I’m finally started to understand the basic rules I better
","[6/3/20, 4:35:30 PM] Joe: Sí, definitivamente es más fácil pero hay tantas palabras jaja
","[6/3/20, 4:36:14 PM] Joe: Nunca termina
","[6/3/20, 4:39:09 PM] Joe: Oook. Get more than 3 hours of sleep today haha. Sleep well babe. Buenas noches

","[6/4/20, 11:19:34 AM] Joe: Haha no it wasn’t bad. I can barely remember anything that happened in the dream now cause that was about a week ago. All I really remember is we were together. It was a good dream

","In the end i decided if I’m going to live like that I’d build one of those tiny houses on wheels

","[6/4/20, 12:06:42 PM] Joe: I did a lot of research on building a super tiny house haha. It’s so cool cause you can spend money on really high quality material since you don’t need as much material to build small.

","[6/4/20, 2:17:03 PM] Joe: I never would’ve thought to try those combinations haha
","[6/4/20, 2:22:50 PM] Joe: Haha all good. If that’s what you like it’s fine with me.
","[6/4/20, 2:24:04 PM] Joe: As long as you’re not as drunk as Tokyo in that one episode when Rio comes back. Hahaha i was watching it yesterday, super drunk spanish sounds hilarious
","[6/4/20, 2:25:31 PM] Joe: I also realized the hardest character for me to understand is Denver. I don’t know why, maybe he just talks the fastest or something but can never understand him
","[6/4/20, 4:02:16 PM] Joe: Hahah I believe you. I just would love to go out and spend some time with “content” you 😂
","[6/4/20, 4:03:46 PM] Joe: Yeah I’m watching it again. I can understand more this time but what I do is I’ll watch it and if there is an interesting scene I watch it once with spanish subtitles to know what words they’re using, then again with English subtitles while listening for the words I read the first time. It’s a weird way to study haha
","[6/4/20, 4:04:34 PM] Joe: I feel like the subtitles don’t match what he says a lot of the time. Or at least more often than the other characters
","[6/4/20, 4:05:51 PM] Joe: Like he was in the bathroom and said he didn’t hear anything. Sounds like he says “escucho nada” but the subtitles were like “no .. ... oido”
","[6/4/20, 4:13:13 PM] Joe: Hah I’m missing some filler words that the subtitles had but I listened to it so many times cause I was like, “no way he is saying that” haha
","[6/4/20, 4:13:50 PM] Joe: Haha alright for sure I will
","[6/4/20, 4:14:13 PM] Joe: I can never understand Denver though. It’s so weird.

","[6/4/20, 4:26:44 PM] Joe: Green is my favorite color haha and I love nature
","[6/4/20, 4:27:10 PM] Joe: South sounds interesting too haha
","[6/4/20, 4:28:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha you’re going to induce analysis paralysis with all these options 😂
","[6/4/20, 4:29:41 PM] Joe: I can only stay for 90 days unless I apply for some kind of visa or something right? I’ll have to get all that figured out and we need to narrow down a plan haha shit is complicated
","
","But Spain sounds cool to me. I’d be super down to move there for a while
","[6/4/20, 4:38:41 PM] Joe: 😂
","[6/4/20, 4:40:12 PM] Joe: So many options haha maybe instead of picking just one you can make a list and we can live in each place until we find our favorite haha
","[6/4/20, 4:48:24 PM] Joe: Is it impossible? I mean...we’re not THAT old haha and it’s not like we have to spend 10 years in each place or anything. Few years here few years there you know?
","[6/4/20, 4:48:52 PM] Joe: In the future hahah
","[6/4/20, 4:49:08 PM] Joe: But for now I don’t know, whatever works for you. I’ll go wherever
","[6/4/20, 4:49:17 PM] Joe: Doesn’t matter too much to me where I am
","[6/4/20, 4:50:45 PM] Joe: Spain sounds cool and like it has a wide variety of places. But whatever we can make work is where I’m going haha
","[6/4/20, 4:52:13 PM] Joe: You pick the place and I’ll just meet you there
","[6/4/20, 4:55:28 PM] Joe: Hahaha shit
","[6/4/20, 5:00:18 PM] Joe: Haha don’t shut up
","[6/4/20, 5:00:36 PM] Joe: It’s all good
","[6/4/20, 5:02:14 PM] Joe: Hmm it’s hard to describe but i really don’t mind too much the location as long as I have the necessities. And it would matter even less if I was with you.
","[6/4/20, 5:02:59 PM] Joe: If the place is new to me it’s an adventure either way and I want to know all different kinds of places in the world
","[6/4/20, 5:08:07 PM] Joe: Haha sweeeet. You’ll be my tour guide 😂
","[6/4/20, 5:09:14 PM] Joe: I’ll be back in California in a few days and then I can actually start the process of getting everything setup to go
","[6/4/20, 5:20:13 PM] Joe: I better make it there haha shit. 
","
","I don’t know what my family will say. I’m sure they’ll be excited

","[6/4/20, 5:53:03 PM] Joe: That’s cool. I told Nelly haha she was just like “oooh that’s nice” haha But I didn’t tell her much except that “I have a friend that lives in Spain that I talk to and she only speaks Spanish”
","[6/4/20, 5:53:42 PM] Joe: The rest of my family can find out when I have my plans to visit you more figured out

","[6/5/20, 12:40:22 PM] Joe: Hahaha

","[6/5/20, 12:48:20 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully I can find some time to go pick a new skateboard up. If not I can get it over the weekend

","[6/5/20, 1:05:34 PM] Joe: Haha what did you get for her?
","[6/5/20, 1:18:11 PM] Joe: 😂
","[6/5/20, 1:19:16 PM] Joe: Ah yeah I guess I’ve never seen it at normal levels. But compared to when you first started going out, it’s pretty busy haha
","[6/5/20, 1:19:48 PM] Joe: That’s nice of you. Yeah good thing you had the music with you haha.
","[6/5/20, 1:20:31 PM] Joe: I’m trying to draw a new design for my portfolio but I can’t come up with any good ideas. I’m trying to do the mobile phone design first then I’ll make another for bigger screens.

","‎[6/5/20, 1:27:08 PM] Joe: ‎image omitted
","[6/5/20, 1:28:13 PM] Joe: Super simple sketches first then I’ll probably try to make it in a program like Adobe XD before coding it up. Going to go through the whole process this time haha. I kind of just went straight to coding the last version, that’s probably why it sucks haha
","[6/5/20, 1:29:51 PM] Joe: I suck at designing stuff haha fuck
","[6/5/20, 1:30:12 PM] Joe: My brain just loves to come up with ugly stuff haha

","[6/5/20, 4:05:21 PM] Joe: Yeah I got a little bit done. I don’t know if I like it. Probably should draw another. Then I need to draw what it would look like on a bigger screen before I make the prototype in Adobe XD or figma.

","This was the original one I made which I also hate hahaha

","[6/5/20, 4:41:44 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s an iterative process
","[6/5/20, 4:42:08 PM] Joe: Just have to keep trying different things until I get an idea of what works and what doesn’t

","[6/5/20, 5:42:09 PM] Joe: I would love to see what you could make if you used actual UO design tools
","[6/5/20, 5:43:24 PM] Joe: Haha oh for sure I’m just saying, your stuff looks good and without the right tool so it’d probably look fairly professional if you ever use the other tools in the future
","[6/5/20, 5:44:01 PM] Joe: But you did a pretty good job haha way better than me. Thank youuu
","[6/5/20, 5:46:29 PM] Joe: Hahah siiii

","[6/5/20, 5:52:14 PM] Joe: So many tips
","[6/5/20, 5:52:45 PM] Joe: I like the idea of removing the stack section and adding it to the about me
","[6/5/20, 5:53:29 PM] Joe: Black and white is probably a good idea too and I’ll take a picture with another hat soon haha
","[6/5/20, 5:55:55 PM] Joe: Haha no math for the next photo
","[6/5/20, 5:56:39 PM] Joe: Alright I’ll let you know if I think of any other ideas.
","[6/5/20, 5:57:45 PM] Joe: Haha the math one? That’s good to know 😂
","[6/5/20, 5:57:54 PM] Joe: I like that hat 🧢
","[6/5/20, 5:58:18 PM] Joe: But like you said, the hat is political so not great for a portfolio haha

","[6/5/20, 6:16:41 PM] Joe: Looks professional
","[6/5/20, 6:21:31 PM] Joe: From what I remember...much easier than that hahaa that looks complicated
","[6/5/20, 6:22:17 PM] Joe: Or like a lot of unnecessary layers compared to how you build them with Adobe XD or Figma
","[6/5/20, 6:25:28 PM] Joe: Haha thank you I really appreciate the work you put into that. Another design for your web design portfolio 💼
","[6/5/20, 6:29:52 PM] Joe: Your sleep schedule is crazy right now haha you better get back on track before going back to work
","[6/5/20, 6:30:57 PM] Joe: Staying up late and helping me with my portfolio design is hella sweet though 😘
","[6/5/20, 6:41:30 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s going to be weird figuring out our new schedules haha

","[6/5/20, 7:06:55 PM] Joe: But that’s ok, I think it’s understood it’ll be a little more difficult. I’m still going to come visit you haha

","[6/14/20, 8:36:04 AM] Joe: Yeah that’s true. I need more projects in the portfolio for sure. Maybe I should work on that a little bit today.
","[6/14/20, 8:38:23 AM] Joe: Damn tomorrow I start camp. Going to be a little strange with all the extra stuff we have to do. Hopefully since it’s only half days we can mostly skate outside and not have to worry too much.
","[6/14/20, 8:39:56 AM] Joe: They had all kinds of rules for cleaning things before and after they get used, social distancing, when to wear mask and/or gloves

","[6/14/20, 8:48:06 AM] Joe: Yeah pretty much. We get everyone into groups by skill level and teach tricks and how to skate the park better in general
","[6/14/20, 8:48:23 AM] Joe: how to utilize the ramps better and all that
","[6/14/20, 8:49:14 AM] Joe: I'm on my computer and i accidentally hit send halfway through typing a sentence haha

","[6/14/20, 9:11:08 AM] Joe: Hmmmm I like the older ones but we don’t get many
","[6/14/20, 9:11:39 AM] Joe: We get more girls than we do boys between 10-14
","[6/14/20, 9:13:53 AM] Joe: They’re just mellower and easier to deal with haha. If there is a little one that is super well behaved they’ll end up being my favorite haha.
","[6/14/20, 9:14:25 AM] Joe: Oh god I hope not hahaha
","[6/14/20, 9:18:59 AM] Joe: Haha good thing we don’t get too many teenage girls either. 1 or 2 maybe. Lots of younger girls though which is interesting. Parents signing them up for skate camp. They’re usually pretty cool though, more helpful and listen better than the boys haha
","[6/14/20, 9:26:25 AM] Joe: The demographics are changing slowly in skateboarding. Lots of girls are skating now. It’s cool to see. Skateboarding is supposed to be for everyone so I like to see it expanding.

","[6/14/20, 2:39:56 PM] Joe: I'm good, just messing with some of my old projects. Cleaning up the code a little bit
","[6/14/20, 2:41:32 PM] Joe: Haha you love little Rogel. You always have him wrapped up like his Kangaroo mama hahaha
","[6/14/20, 2:43:02 PM] Joe: Yeah i was surprised when you starting talking shit about them hahaha not a bad thing though. Can't be super sweet all the time haha
","[6/14/20, 2:46:38 PM] Joe: Haha i can tell. You're very sweet with meeee 😂 But that's totally understandable. I really dislike superficiality
","[6/14/20, 2:53:39 PM] Joe: Being sweet is all part of your scheme to get me to Spain haha
","[6/14/20, 2:54:19 PM] Joe: I'm interested to see/hear you get mad or annoyed at me a little bit haha I reaaaaallly want to know what you get like when you're upset with me. I
","[6/14/20, 2:54:32 PM] Joe: I'm sure i'll push your buttons enough to find out eventually haha
","[6/14/20, 3:00:49 PM] Joe: haha i'm nervous 😂
","[6/14/20, 3:01:43 PM] Joe: Alright haha for sure. I'm sure i can handle it regardless. I just want to be prepared haha
","[6/14/20, 3:03:25 PM] Joe: Haha i don't expect you to be sweet all the time. I just want to know how to work with the type of person you are. If you're the type that needs space or needs to talk about it right away, it's good to know these things
","[6/14/20, 3:04:36 PM] Joe: It sucks when someone doesn't understand how you deal with being angry. Usually that leads to even more anger and bigger fights haha.
","[6/14/20, 3:06:03 PM] Joe: i just like to know what works and what doesn't haha.
","[6/14/20, 3:06:26 PM] Joe: hahah ok so don't give too much room when you're mad...got it
","[6/14/20, 3:10:13 PM] Joe: Ok ok i get that. Makes sense.
","[6/14/20, 3:11:20 PM] Joe: Well....i want you to know that if you feel i'm not giving you enough of anything, attention or space, let me know. I agree that communication is key so be as open as you can and i'll try my best to do the same
","[6/14/20, 3:17:30 PM] Joe: Noooo problem. I just want to know more about you haha. I'm super interested in what you're like day to day now since we've been talking for so long.

","[6/14/20, 3:37:58 PM] Joe: Damn you have so many haha i can't find more. When i do i'll send them though. You win this round haha
","[6/14/20, 3:45:13 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha. It's situational for me. If i'm only a little mad or annoyed, i'd like to talk about it. But if i get really upset, to the point i want to yell, i would rather just have space and not fight. Take time to breathe then come back and talk about it.
","[6/14/20, 3:45:56 PM] Joe: It's really hard to upset me to the point of yelling. That's rare. But when it does happen space for a short time, with the understanding we'll try to talk about it later, is best for me.
","[6/14/20, 3:47:49 PM] Joe: But most of the time I just try to bring up what i'm feeling if there are any problems before it gets to be too big of a deal and since you seem like you're willing to talk to me about things we should be good
","[6/14/20, 3:53:20 PM] Joe: haha it's super rare. Not much upsets me to that point.
","[6/14/20, 3:55:04 PM] Joe: Now i know what you mean about it being hard to describe haha
","[6/14/20, 3:55:48 PM] Joe: But I don't want you to think i get super mad often cause i don't. I try to not let things bug me.
","[6/14/20, 3:58:03 PM] Joe: What time do you have to get up tomorrow?

","[6/15/20, 4:57:22 PM] Joe: hahaha
","[6/15/20, 4:58:13 PM] Joe: Oh the one cool thing about forgetting everything was, we tricked her into thinking she quit smoking hahaha
","[6/15/20, 4:59:02 PM] Joe: One day she was going to go buy her pack of smokes and my aunt just told her, ""you don't smoke anymore, remember?"". Grandma said, ""oh i don't? Ok"" and never smoked again.
","[6/15/20, 5:01:02 PM] Joe: When that happened she was in her 80s i think, and she had been smoking since a teenager haha. She passed away like 10 years ago but it's just an interesting example of how powerful those mental problems can be.

","[6/16/20, 2:49:03 PM] Joe: Hahaha true! I’ve been skating too much since I got back and not enough when I was in Hawaii. Have to build the strength back up.

","[6/17/20, 1:37:37 AM] Joe: That’s why I wanted to say something to you before I went to bed. I really want to talk to you all the time but it’s just been difficult lately.
","[6/17/20, 1:42:22 AM] Joe: Haha Jealous of these cats. Thank you. Alright have a good morning ☀️

","[6/17/20, 1:19:46 PM] Joe: You need to wear some stretchy pants next time
","[6/17/20, 1:23:25 PM] Joe: Hahaha you got him to shed a tear. Didn’t even have to make him watch The Notebook first haha.
","[6/17/20, 1:24:00 PM] Joe: That’s sweet though. Videos like that are great, looking back at all the memories and stuff
","[6/17/20, 1:32:35 PM] Joe: hahah what was with the music? Looks like a good time
","[6/17/20, 1:33:52 PM] Joe: Sounds good. How did you like it?
","[6/17/20, 1:34:49 PM] Joe: Ooooh, yeah i was confused when the Christmas music came on  haha
","[6/17/20, 1:38:37 PM] Joe: That makes sense. Have the fancier stuff when you go out. You can make the classic stuff at home haha
","[6/17/20, 1:39:39 PM] Joe: Hella cute
","[6/17/20, 1:40:47 PM] Joe: Hmmm I'm not a huge fan of sushi but i still eat it haha
","[6/17/20, 1:42:42 PM] Joe: I don't know what i like. Just good tasting food haha. Most things grilled on a barbecue is delicious to me. Lots of meat dishes.
","[6/17/20, 1:43:03 PM] Joe: My favorite dish is probably lomo saltado
","[6/17/20, 1:43:17 PM] Joe: hella good mmmmm i want some now
","[6/17/20, 1:45:33 PM] Joe: Oh i love to eat a good bowl of pho. We have some really good Vietnamese food places around here. Ah there is too much stuff i like. Some i don't like but i'll give most things a try
","[6/17/20, 1:45:49 PM] Joe: Yes it's a Peruvian dish
","[6/17/20, 1:49:54 PM] Joe: The bay area is a really good place for trying different kinds of food. You can find food from any culture relatively easy around here with a short drive. There are quite a few Vietnamese places around me. It's super good. Especially if you want some hot soup
","[6/17/20, 1:49:56 PM] Joe: mmmm
","[6/17/20, 1:52:12 PM] Joe: Oh and food from a good taco truck is always smackin haha

","[6/17/20, 2:09:11 PM] Joe: Yeah that's true. It can definitely change your perspective on life
","[6/17/20, 2:12:31 PM] Joe: I have friends that have gone on trips to the Philippines and Vietnam and they enjoyed the time there. I need to go
","[6/17/20, 2:17:44 PM] Joe: Hahah that would be siiiiick. If only we were free now. We'll get there eventually haha
","[6/17/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: Haha I only call her on the weekends officially now. Sometimes I call during the week but I get busy so I don’t want her waiting for me when my schedule changes.
","[6/17/20, 2:21:25 PM] Joe: I’m still learning haha I’m sure you’ll get a little English figured out too so we’ll be fiiine 😂
","[6/17/20, 2:45:32 PM] Joe: I’m still so terrible at stringing together a sentence so a lot of it is me listening to her speak Spanish to me. But I try to speak Spanish when I can figure out a sentence or two
","[6/17/20, 2:47:21 PM] Joe: When you send me audio clips too. I just listen over and over and try to hear what you’re saying really well. I don’t know. I’m trying though. I still have my notebook which I forgot at work today because I was trying to look at it when I had time haha
","[6/17/20, 2:48:38 PM] Joe: Oh yeah I did get my one sentence in this morning haha. It’s difficult to remind myself to practice but I try
","[6/17/20, 2:49:35 PM] Joe: They’d be so confused. My notes are all over the place. I also have my sketches for websites and notes for programming.
","[6/17/20, 2:49:49 PM] Joe: A bunch of nonsense in that notebook to whoever finds it haha
","[6/17/20, 2:51:11 PM] Joe: My spanish will be limited to one liners that resemble the structure of a meme 😂
","[6/17/20, 2:52:08 PM] Joe: Hahah nah I’ll get better though. My vocabulary is just super limited still. I haven’t been studying vocabulary enough
","[6/17/20, 2:54:21 PM] Joe: Hahaha wow that’s a lot of stuff we sent to each other 😂
","[6/17/20, 2:55:57 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s hard. You always say things in different ways
","[6/17/20, 2:58:58 PM] Joe: The only thing you say often is that you’re sorry you fell asleep haha other than that you vary your sentences quite a bit so you might say something similar but it isn’t the same phrase
","[6/17/20, 3:00:16 PM] Joe: Unlike me hahah I’ll say the same exact thing over and over 😂
","[6/17/20, 3:01:24 PM] Joe: Hahah that’s the one. You’re most used phrase by far haha
","[6/17/20, 3:01:37 PM] Joe: Your*
","[6/17/20, 3:03:19 PM] Joe: Haha siii
","[6/17/20, 3:04:10 PM] Joe: Yeah now I got up too late. My body is still in Hawaii time. 8am feels like 5am to me.
","[6/17/20, 3:07:32 PM] Joe: It does haha
","[6/17/20, 3:08:11 PM] Joe: Wait I missed this thing. So what class are you going to take?
","[6/17/20, 3:17:08 PM] Joe: Thanks. I appreciate that. That was a lot to type out haha
","[6/17/20, 3:18:53 PM] Joe: Eh actually I wasn’t far off from listening to you. There is sooo much I didn’t hear correctly or comprehend but got enough that I was “in the ballpark”
","[6/17/20, 3:21:07 PM] Joe: When you say things like “que ir a clase” the words all blend together haha. Like “tener quira clase”
","[6/17/20, 3:22:46 PM] Joe: I wasn’t very confident though haha and like I said I missed a lot of it. when I translated i realized I had the basic idea of what you were saying but I missed the specifics
","[6/17/20, 3:24:28 PM] Joe: Yeah whenever you start to speed up you lose me a little but it’s ok. It’s good to hear what someone really sounds like when they say these things. The same blending of words happens often when people speak English too
","[6/17/20, 3:25:52 PM] Joe: Haha sometimes you say “nada” and my brain totally gets stuck on how it is connected to what you are saying 😂
","[6/17/20, 3:26:43 PM] Joe: Like I think you said “nada” at the beginning of an audio clip one time and it confused the crap out of me because it changed the context of what you were saying when I translated it in my head haha
","[6/17/20, 3:29:47 PM] Joe: Haha that’s strange. I guess I need to speak “proper English” so you can understand me 😂
","[6/17/20, 3:33:52 PM] Joe: Haha damn I still haven’t shown a video of you to my friends. I want to now. I need to get there reactions.
","[6/17/20, 3:36:12 PM] Joe: But they’ve probably all lurked on your Instagram already I bet cause everyone is so nosy haha

","[6/17/20, 3:50:45 PM] Joe: He is 2 years younger than me
","[6/17/20, 3:54:48 PM] Joe: Haha that’s true. It would be a good time. Got to get you to the US though. It’s in Eugene, Oregon
","[6/17/20, 3:59:15 PM] Joe: Hahah fuck that guy. I'll get you here
","[6/17/20, 3:59:25 PM] Joe: med
","[6/17/20, 3:59:43 PM] Joe: hahah that last one was an accident. Ignore that
","[6/17/20, 4:05:07 PM] Joe: Hahah one of the little kids at skate camp said he likes Andrew Yang 😂
","[6/17/20, 4:07:20 PM] Joe: He's cool. His name is Marco Joseph haha my middle name is Marco. So i'm Joseph Marco. And he is Peruvian. He doesn't like skating that much though so that's points off for him.
","[6/17/20, 4:08:12 PM] Joe: Alright i'll talk to you later. Sleep well! Buenas noches 😘

","[6/18/20, 2:54:10 PM] Joe: It’s from when I hit my arm and chin with my skateboard the other day. I don’t why the bruise got so bad out of nowhere 🤷‍♂️
","[6/18/20, 3:27:01 PM] Joe: Yeah it got me good. But good news is i supposedly won a micro-grant from this foundation that Andrew Yang started. It's only $250 but i'll take it hahaha

Cause the receipt said i paid for ""passport services"" which makes me think i only paid for the appointment
","[6/22/20, 1:54:28 PM] Joe: Hopefully it's only 50 total. I'm looking online and supposedly i have to pay more for the booklet or whatever

","[6/22/20, 2:57:28 PM] Joe: Haha yeah but I think I’m only allowed to go for 90 days unless I apply for something specific. Or even if I want to work there or whatever. It’s all different stuff I have to do. I don’t know it’s complicated.
","[6/22/20, 2:58:59 PM] Joe: But what I do depends a lot on what you want. When I buy my ticket I’ll need to know what I should be planning for I guess. Haha I don’t know it’s hard to explain. I don’t need all the details but a general idea of what you want would be nice.
","[6/22/20, 2:59:14 PM] Joe: I don’t want to come barging into your life in a way you didn’t want

","[6/24/20, 12:35:20 PM] Joe: Our public transportation is so trash haha. It would take me forever to get home if I didn’t drive.
","[6/24/20, 12:39:30 PM] Joe: 30 minutes driving but probably 1 or 2 hours with public transportation. Either a train and bus or two busses
","[6/24/20, 12:47:54 PM] Joe: Haha yeah same. I was really enjoying life without a car in Hawaii. Everything I needed was close enough I could just skate everywhere
","[6/24/20, 12:56:04 PM] Joe: Hahaha sounds like a plan
","[6/24/20, 12:56:38 PM] Joe: Is it more typical to use public transportation than to drive your own car around where you live?

","‎[6/27/20, 12:03:40 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[6/27/20, 12:07:03 AM] Joe: It’s a stick shift. I’ve only driven auto. My first time driving a manual transmission was a few days ago when he let me drive that car haha
","[6/27/20, 12:08:29 AM] Joe: I figured it out quick. I learned already how to drive a stick shift in a video game and it was about the same. But next I have to learn how to slide the car. That’s going to be hella fun. He keeps trying to convince me to buy my own drift car but I don’t want to haha
","[6/27/20, 12:13:29 AM] Joe: Haha yeah his car has a manual gearshift
","[6/27/20, 12:14:25 AM] Joe: Every car I’ve had has been automatic
","[6/27/20, 12:15:01 AM] Joe: Good thing I learned now haha
","[6/27/20, 12:15:18 AM] Joe: There is probably a lot of good drift cars near you then
","[6/27/20, 12:16:14 AM] Joe: Hahaha damn now I want to get my drifting down before i meet you.
","[6/27/20, 12:16:45 AM] Joe: So I can scare the shit out of you by sliding the car around

","[6/27/20, 12:36:14 AM] Joe: Hahah I’ll have to add that to my notebook. But yeah it’s a controlled skid. Well....hopefully it’s controlled 😂
","[6/27/20, 12:38:17 AM] Joe: Damn that’s hella sick. It’s like in the city too? Not just outside the city or something?
","[6/27/20, 12:45:16 AM] Joe: Yeah it’s a suburban area so lots of houses. It’s an ok little neighborhood, not the best haha but not the worst either
","[6/27/20, 1:11:39 AM] Joe: I believe it’s like $1800, maybe a little more, for their 2 bedroom 1 bathroom. They live in one half of a duplex.
","[6/27/20, 1:13:46 AM] Joe: No not at all. Like i said it’s not the best neighborhood, it can be a little sketchy in that area. But the block he lives on is chill
","[6/27/20, 1:15:00 AM] Joe: The architecture near you is way cooler than what’s around here haha
","[6/27/20, 1:15:24 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m getting tired. I’ll probably fall asleep really soon

","[6/27/20, 8:35:49 AM] Joe: Hahaha niiiiiice
","[6/27/20, 8:47:07 AM] Joe: Hahah that’s true, it’ll be a nice surprise. I love when I randomly find stuff that I misplaced
","[6/27/20, 9:12:40 AM] Joe: So rare that it’s money for me. It’s usually just a receipt or something useless in my pockets hahaha

","[6/27/20, 9:51:43 AM] Joe: Haha dude 2 degrees is hella cold. That’s like 35F. It’s 60F now and I’m already cold 😂
","[6/27/20, 9:52:25 AM] Joe: No I haven’t snowboarded before. I really want to try it. Looks fun
","[6/27/20, 9:52:47 AM] Joe: Have you snowboarded before?
","[6/27/20, 10:16:21 AM] Joe: FUCK!
","[6/27/20, 10:16:56 AM] Joe: Can I at least get to you first? That would be nice. Then they can start another quarantine but this time we can be together hahaha

","[6/27/20, 10:23:15 AM] Joe: So now if I can’t get to you before the end of the year I need more shit?? I better figure out how to get to you as soon as possible haha. What a shitty situation
","[6/27/20, 10:39:26 AM] Joe: I feel like I’m going to go for sure. I’ve actually been getting nervous cause my spanish is still trash 😂
","[6/27/20, 10:40:36 AM] Joe: But also excited cause it will be a really different experience for me and I’ll learn a lot while also being around you haha
","[6/27/20, 10:53:34 AM] Joe: Hahaha our first video call will be a bunch of “uuuuuuh mmmmm hmmmm” 😂 I really don’t mind the challenge. Even if I don’t understand a single word you say I’ll still enjoy our call I’m sure.
","[6/27/20, 10:54:29 AM] Joe: But yeah, one step at a time. Have to get that passport. My excitement is building as the days go by. It feels like we’re getting close haha
","[6/27/20, 2:56:42 PM] Joe: No worries. I’m working on the “drift car” again haha.
","[6/27/20, 2:59:40 PM] Joe: How much were flights? Super expensive? I haven’t been looking. Just saving my money. I already know I’m going to have to spend a lot for a ticket most likely

","[6/27/20, 3:08:34 PM] Joe: I won’t tell you the cost lol I

","[6/28/20, 8:24:24 AM] Joe: Holaaaa

","[6/28/20, 8:39:15 AM] Joe: That’s so wild. I never imagined talking to you for so long or planning to see you when you first messaged me. But I’m happy about it now. We only missed like 1 day talking to each other in all that time haha. Not bad.
","[6/28/20, 9:40:59 AM] Joe: Junk food and beer 😋

","[6/28/20, 11:11:21 AM] Joe: Haha 🤷‍♂️ that’s what it looks like when you send videos or pictures of your meals to me.

","[6/28/20, 11:42:29 AM] Joe: Hahaha 🙈
","[6/28/20, 12:12:10 PM] Joe: Hmmm I like medium sized short hair dogs. Interesting coloration of the fur is cool to me. I’ll have to pay more attention to what makes me like dogs when I see them.
","[6/28/20, 12:13:35 PM] Joe: I do like long tail instead of the little stump tail. And funny ears too. I was having too much fun playing with Sock’a ears cause one is floppy and the other stands up straight
","[6/28/20, 12:15:55 PM] Joe: I like an affectionate dog but not to the point where they get overly needy for attention. A nice balance haha
","[6/28/20, 12:58:10 PM] Joe: Haha that’s why I like short hair. So they can be close to me without shedding too much everywhere.

","[6/29/20, 7:48:01 AM] Joe: 🍅
","[6/29/20, 7:53:23 AM] Joe: I can work from a distance. “Remote work” or whatever.

","[6/29/20, 7:55:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I’m confident in my ability to learn the technology for the project. It’s similar to what I’ve worked with before.
","[6/29/20, 7:56:12 AM] Joe: Oh I forgot to tell you how i got it. I actually know the guy from a class I took a few years ago. He messaged me on LinkedIn about the position
","[6/29/20, 7:59:48 AM] Joe: Haha be careful in the sun. You’re going to get toasted 😂
","[6/29/20, 8:02:11 AM] Joe: I’m pretty confident about this one since he approached me and he knows me from a class but we’ll see 🤷‍♂️

","[6/29/20, 11:48:55 AM] Joe: I’m almost free haha. I’m so tired and hungry. I’m going to eat, talk to the guy about the job, and probably take a nap. I had zero energy today for some reason
","[6/29/20, 1:45:27 PM] Joe: It went pretty good! He said he will email me later with more details. But it sounds like a cool gig. $1500/week to code 1-2 features every 2 weeks. All remote work so I can work from anywhere. I hope this works out. It would be perfect
","[6/29/20, 2:20:49 PM] Joe: $1500 every week. So $6000/month. But that’s before taxes. And doing the math it’s about $78,000/year which isn’t great for software developers but I’ll take it haha. Something to pad the resume with so I can get the big money later. Writing code pays really well, it’s just hard to find work sometimes.
","[6/29/20, 2:22:59 PM] Joe: We’ll see what happens. Hopefully it works out. I still have to learn some new technologies I haven’t worked with. Ooooh I’m excited haha
","[6/29/20, 3:12:46 PM] Joe: Thank you thank you! 😊
","[6/29/20, 3:13:12 PM] Joe: Haha no worries I was eating
","[6/29/20, 3:18:09 PM] Joe: He didn’t email me yet but I’m assuming it would be in a week or two.
","[6/29/20, 3:18:50 PM] Joe: I’m going to keep myself from getting too excited in case he never emails me 😂

","[6/29/20, 3:23:07 PM] Joe: I don’t know for how long. Seemed like an ongoing project. I’ll have to see what the contract looks like that he sends
","[6/29/20, 3:25:35 PM] Joe: It’s not really going to have hours per day. More like, get the work done within 2 weeks. Work however long and whenever you need to so you can finish it
","[6/29/20, 3:26:20 PM] Joe: Haha it’s an app for IOS and Android
","[6/29/20, 3:30:42 PM] Joe: It’s some music app or something like that.
","[6/29/20, 3:32:06 PM] Joe: Not too sure. It’s something about music recommendations and it will work with different music apps. I don’t know. He didn’t explain it super well but it sounded interesting

","[6/30/20, 7:10:33 AM] Joe: Thanks babe. I’m stoked.
","[6/30/20, 7:13:06 AM] Joe: I need to start waking up earlier again. Then I can talk to you in the mornings for longer before I go to work. I’ve been lazy lately, waking up at the last minute
","[6/30/20, 7:13:26 AM] Joe: And I always fall asleep right around the time you wake up haha
","[6/30/20, 7:17:23 AM] Joe: Hah yeah our schedules our messed up right now. I’ll do better though

","[6/30/20, 7:31:58 AM] Joe: So it’s perfect
","[6/30/20, 7:32:51 AM] Joe: I have Apple Music and they make a favorite playlist every week. This week is the first time they added some of the spanish music you sent me haha. I must be listening to it a lot
","[6/30/20, 7:43:06 AM] Joe: Haha yeah we’ll see. If I make it to you first, then they can reimplement the quarantine as long as they want 😂
","[6/30/20, 7:43:19 AM] Joe: Mmmm 😋
","[6/30/20, 7:44:48 AM] Joe: They put a song by Los Delinqüentes. Tartarichi. I listen to their album a lot haha
","[6/30/20, 7:52:54 AM] Joe: Hahah I don’t go a pick that song to listen to. It just plays a lot from when I play the album
","[6/30/20, 7:58:34 AM] Joe: I was wondering when Apple was going to start recommending music in spanish haha
","[6/30/20, 8:01:36 AM] Joe: I’m going to work now. I’m doing a 12 hour shift again but I can still talk to you during the shift. I don’t do much while I monitor the park.
","[6/30/20, 8:02:05 AM] Joe: Promise I’ll start getting up a little earlier so we can talk more. I miss talking to you as much as we used to be able to.
","[6/30/20, 8:04:30 AM] Joe: Hahah true. I learn some of the songs and don’t even know what I’m saying 😂
","[6/30/20, 8:11:10 AM] Joe: Oh no 🙈🙈

","[7/1/20, 7:44:40 AM] Joe: Soo much work
","[7/1/20, 7:50:03 AM] Joe: He said we’ll talk more today and possibly start “on boarding”. Not sure if I’ll actually start working or just get setup with access to the codebase and all that.
","[7/1/20, 7:50:19 AM] Joe: Do the contract and non-disclosures and all that

","[7/1/20, 11:33:58 AM] Joe: Sorry I was attending to injured children. They were dropping like flys for a minute there
","[7/1/20, 11:34:41 AM] Joe: Getting through a whole day with no injuries is tough

","[7/1/20, 1:46:19 PM] Joe: I don’t know when this guy is going to call me 🤷‍♂️ still waiting
","‎[7/1/20, 2:14:06 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[7/1/20, 2:15:02 PM] Joe: I guess I told him I’m free after 1pm and he never really confirmed the exact time he would contact me. So I guess I just have to wait around for his call
","[7/1/20, 2:19:44 PM] Joe: Yesterday he was free after 3pm so I’m assuming he’ll call around that time. I’m not doing anything anyway so it’s fine
","[7/1/20, 2:21:05 PM] Joe: I just finished eating some ribs. I do kind of want another snack though 🤔
","[7/1/20, 2:31:14 PM] Joe: I’m just going to keep eating snacks until he calls. I think I might have some grapes or something
","[7/1/20, 2:32:57 PM] Joe: Interesting choice haha is it good? I don’t think I’ve had a wine with lemon in it
","[7/1/20, 3:08:49 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[7/1/20, 3:09:20 PM] Joe: Noooo still no call. I’m going to end up taking a nap haha

","[7/1/20, 3:59:38 PM] Joe: Honestly when you told me you didn’t have much patience early on, I was a little nervous that you wouldn’t wait. I’m really glad you’re holding out so long haha

","[7/2/20, 7:17:38 AM] Joe: Only the best for you haha
","[7/2/20, 7:42:30 AM] Joe: Haha true. I was going to move but I think since I’m only here till August i might as well save 2 months of rent. Plus my dad is redoing the house to sell it soon so I can help him out

","[7/2/20, 1:05:12 PM] Joe: Either go skate and film, try to learn some coding stuff or some more spanish, or go to my friends house. Depends on the day but usually i get lunch after i get off then decide what to do.
","[7/2/20, 1:15:02 PM] Joe: Oh yeah i guess that's true.
","[7/2/20, 1:16:32 PM] Joe: I have nothing to teach you haha i learn in a weird way. I just listen to stuff i don't know and keep looking up words until it sticks. I never feel like i learned something at the end of the day. I only notice it's working when i don't have to use the translator as much or i understand something i didn't before
","[7/2/20, 1:17:17 PM] Joe: I'm really trying to practice hearing all the words that people say but it's hard to know when some words end and others start when i don't know the word they're saying in the first place haha
","[7/2/20, 1:17:48 PM] Joe: They're going to be soo happy to see you
","[7/2/20, 2:16:53 PM] Joe: I learn every time i talk to you a little more
","[7/2/20, 2:18:02 PM] Joe: Haha i mean, there isn't anything in particular i think i need to learn. Not that i can think of anyway. But i have been picking up a lot from talking to you.
","[7/2/20, 2:18:43 PM] Joe: I don't have to use the translator as often haha and sometimes i use it just to double check or because i don't know only a few of the words. I'm getting better
","[7/2/20, 2:19:36 PM] Joe: hahah i can't wait
","[7/2/20, 2:20:09 PM] Joe: it'll be pretty funny haha damn hopefully i can communicate enough to keep you entertained

","[7/2/20, 3:09:14 PM] Joe: haha for sure! I have a really big album full of the videos and pictures you send me
","[7/2/20, 3:10:14 PM] Joe: That's very true. I guess i've already asked a lot of the main things i wanted to know about you. We kind of skipped the small talk but now we can't escape it hahah
","[7/2/20, 3:11:02 PM] Joe: I'll have to think of some deep dark secret or something to tell you. Spice it up haha. Or i need to come up with some good questions.
","[7/2/20, 3:19:54 PM] Joe: Yeah i like the same things about you. My mom was asking me what i like about you and that was basically the list i gave her. The way you look at life and your personality. I like to hear you laugh and i'm always smiling when i listen to the audio clips you send or watch the videos. Standing there like an idiot smiling with my phone in my hand hahah 😂😂
","[7/2/20, 3:20:17 PM] Joe: Don't even understand half of what i'm hearing too haha
","[7/2/20, 3:21:36 PM] Joe: But you seem ""lighthearted"" to me. And the fact that you would even entertain the idea of me visiting you and how you pursued me, i find it all very interesting haha
","[7/2/20, 3:46:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i try to speak slowly and clearly as i can. Sometimes i forget. And the mask makes it extra difficult to understand me i'm sure
","[7/2/20, 3:47:01 PM] Joe: It's funny, when you talk fast, the first time i listen i don't hear anything haha but after i pick up the words i can't stop hearing it when i listen again. Practicing listening to you really helps
","[7/2/20, 3:48:24 PM] Joe: Haha you were definitely good at making me nervous at the beginning. Always making me do stuff a little outside of my normal
","[7/2/20, 3:48:54 PM] Joe: It was good though. It made it fun. Like when you started asking me to send you audio in spanish 😂 oh god
","[7/2/20, 3:49:17 PM] Joe: I would try so hard to not sound absolutely ridiculous haha
","[7/2/20, 3:49:24 PM] Joe: ronronear
","[7/2/20, 3:51:13 PM] Joe: Haha yeah like going in the water so early in the morning
","[7/2/20, 3:51:21 PM] Joe: oooh that was so cold haha
","[7/2/20, 3:51:30 PM] Joe: It was nice though
","[7/2/20, 3:52:15 PM] Joe: I bet that helped a lot. I was your window into the outside world.
","[7/2/20, 3:52:46 PM] Joe: Aaaaah hahaha i forgot about that one hahahaha
","[7/2/20, 3:52:47 PM] Joe: shit
","[7/2/20, 3:53:12 PM] Joe: Well...i told you i'd send you a video of those things, so i did
","[7/2/20, 3:54:46 PM] Joe: I don't know why but when i watch a video you send from WhatsApp it downloads it to my phone. So i made an album with all the stuff you send me. Easy to find...i'll save them for when i need to embarrass you haha
","[7/2/20, 3:55:13 PM] Joe: Just kidding i wouldn't do that, don't stop sending videos😂
","[7/2/20, 3:56:24 PM] Joe: What? Which one?
","[7/2/20, 3:59:39 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha shiiiiit
","[7/2/20, 3:59:51 PM] Joe: I knew i shouldn't have sent those 😂
","[7/2/20, 4:00:22 PM] Joe: Seriously that's the first time i've every taken a picture and sent it to someone like that haha
","[7/2/20, 4:01:15 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, spitfire haha
","[7/2/20, 4:01:42 PM] Joe: Wait did I? I don't remember hahaha
","[7/2/20, 4:02:03 PM] Joe: Haha i don't know how you convinced me to do so much from so far away
","[7/2/20, 4:02:46 PM] Joe: 🙉🙈🙈 Aaaaah hahah delete them 😂

","[7/2/20, 4:07:58 PM] Joe: Hahahaha that was so strange to me when you asked that. I was thinking to myself, ""what kind of vibes am i giving off here!?""
","[7/2/20, 4:11:15 PM] Joe: Saaame
","[7/2/20, 4:12:25 PM] Joe: Damn i like how i've done things with you that i haven't done with anyone else haha. All cause of the distance. But it's such a different way of getting to know someone. There is literally no option to skip the talking part of it all
","[7/2/20, 4:14:20 PM] Joe: No i don't feel uncomfortable with it. I enjoyed it haha
","[7/2/20, 4:15:15 PM] Joe: I must really like you to be convinced to do it in the first place though haha. Shit, i didn't even have WhatsApp until you told me to download it so we could get off instagram
","[7/2/20, 4:16:16 PM] Joe: Exactly 😊
","[7/2/20, 4:17:59 PM] Joe: Oh sorry haha to be convinced to have ""WhatsApp sex"" in the first place hahah
","[7/2/20, 4:19:00 PM] Joe: Hahah i only got super horny because you sent me sexy videos. Mmmmm very sexy videos lasnjdob
","[7/2/20, 4:20:35 PM] Joe: I'll try to take the initiative sometime haha sorry, i'm not great at that from a distance.
","[7/2/20, 4:21:38 PM] Joe: Haha that dog loves to cuddle with you
","[7/2/20, 4:24:20 PM] Joe: Hella sweet!
","[7/2/20, 4:24:42 PM] Joe: Also, i don't know how the hell i didn't notice you have a nose ring until now hahah
","[7/2/20, 4:25:31 PM] Joe: Mmm hahah you make this difficult for me 😂
","[7/2/20, 4:26:09 PM] Joe: You need a better camera 😂😂
","[7/2/20, 4:26:42 PM] Joe: Just kidding haha i'm sorry i never noticed your nose ring 🙃
","[7/2/20, 4:27:16 PM] Joe: I don't know why i never saw it...i'm blind. It's cute though 🤷‍♂️
","[7/2/20, 4:27:53 PM] Joe: Hahahaha don't beat me up
","[7/2/20, 4:29:07 PM] Joe: Haha rocked that kangaroo
","[7/2/20, 4:29:50 PM] Joe: The kangaroo looks like it wants to beat that dudes ass haha good gif
","[7/2/20, 4:33:13 PM] Joe: I'm totally not jealous of your dog right now ahha
","[7/2/20, 4:33:36 PM] Joe: And did you flip me off?? hahaha
","[7/2/20, 4:36:19 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look trapped
","[7/2/20, 4:36:40 PM] Joe: But it's so cute haha the dog with it's arm on you. Lot's of love
","[7/2/20, 4:43:33 PM] Joe: I want some animals to cuddle with me haha. Dookie still isn’t feeling well so he isn’t having any of my shit when I try to get him to sit near me
","[7/2/20, 4:44:21 PM] Joe: Hah there won’t be any room for me when the dogs are around
","‎[7/2/20, 4:45:36 PM] Joe: ‎video omitted
","[7/2/20, 4:46:09 PM] Joe: Those are his favorite treats and he is usually a little fatty so he must not be feeling well since he isn’t really eating
","[7/2/20, 4:47:22 PM] Joe: True. I love socks.
","[7/2/20, 4:48:23 PM] Joe: Oh yeah, they didn’t really find much. They ended up saying he has acid reflex or something like that. But then he had another appointment and might have some kind of infection
","[7/2/20, 4:48:54 PM] Joe: Naaaaah, the best
","[7/2/20, 4:49:28 PM] Joe: Yeah I don’t know what’s wrong with him but he has an attitude and doesn’t like to be touched right now but usually he doesn’t mind

","[7/2/20, 5:28:37 PM] Joe: I honestly don’t have a good grasp on how much English you know haha I know that you know some for sure. I guess it’s hard to describe how much you know and don’t know.
","[7/2/20, 5:29:07 PM] Joe: I wonder if you know more english than I know spanish 🤔
","[7/2/20, 5:38:00 PM] Joe: Well if I’m coming to Spain I’ll probably have more spanish than you have english eventually. But then if you want to come to the US to see me you’ll need to learn more engliiish
","[7/2/20, 5:38:16 PM] Joe: So you can go to Hawaii hahaha
","[7/2/20, 5:38:56 PM] Joe: I’m looking forward to visiting you in Spain but it would be the dream to be on an island with you somewhere in the world haha. One day
","[7/2/20, 5:42:58 PM] Joe: You’ll just have to have a “green card marriage” hahaha
","[7/2/20, 5:43:05 PM] Joe: Just kidding just kidding
","[7/2/20, 5:44:06 PM] Joe: I’m sure you’ll be able to come at least to visit someday. Fuck Trump haha
","[7/2/20, 5:44:47 PM] Joe: We’ll go on the tv show “90 day fiancé” 😂
","[7/2/20, 5:47:29 PM] Joe: Hahahahaha
","[7/2/20, 5:47:35 PM] Joe: I’m just kidding
","[7/2/20, 5:47:55 PM] Joe: That would be siiiick. Perfect place with the mix of spanish and english hahah
","[7/2/20, 5:49:02 PM] Joe: For sure! She likes that show too much haha. It’s funny to watch it now that I’ve been talking to you for so long
","[7/2/20, 5:49:52 PM] Joe: Sometimes I think what we’re doing is crazy...but then I see that show hahaha
","[7/2/20, 5:51:25 PM] Joe: Ooooh it’s a crazy show haha. The person will go to another country to meet someone they have never met. Then they have to get married in 90 days or the person would have to go back to their country
","[7/2/20, 5:52:39 PM] Joe: Oh yeah definitely.
","[7/2/20, 5:53:09 PM] Joe: But yeah, the show is wild. I’m sure much of it is staged but supposedly some of the people really get married
","[7/2/20, 5:56:01 PM] Joe: Haha oh that’ll be good. I’m looking forward to hearing your reaction.
","[7/2/20, 5:56:59 PM] Joe: Damn I wonder what TV is like in other places now. Hopefully I’ll be finding out soon enough but I never really thought about the differences in TV around the world
","[7/2/20, 6:00:46 PM] Joe: Are you watching already?
","[7/2/20, 6:02:45 PM] Joe: Hahaha i haven’t seen a lot of the people but I didn’t like the ones that I saw very much
","[7/2/20, 6:04:44 PM] Joe: Hahah you’re just going to judge all the people 😂 I wonder why they decide to go on the show. They must pay for a bunch of stuff or something. I don’t get it
","[7/2/20, 6:07:34 PM] Joe: You judging the people is entertaining to me 🤷‍♂️ I think it’s funny the things you notice or point out to me. But yeah, real life is ok, on tv though 😬
","[7/2/20, 6:08:43 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that can happen. Even with phrases, you can start off saying something as a joke and eventually you’re really using the phrase haha
","[7/2/20, 6:09:18 PM] Joe: I’m going to watch La Casa De Papel over and over until I understand everyone 😂
","[7/2/20, 6:10:29 PM] Joe: Haha like when you were judging those ladies with the annoying voices. I don’t know how to describe it but you seem like such a nice person that when I hear you talk like that it makes me laugh
","[7/2/20, 6:12:05 PM] Joe: Perfect haha
","[7/2/20, 6:12:52 PM] Joe: Hahahah
","[7/2/20, 6:13:05 PM] Joe: Mischievous

","[7/2/20, 6:21:32 PM] Joe: Hahaha yes her outfit is not very flattering on her
","[7/2/20, 6:26:21 PM] Joe: Hahah if I ever judge you, the only conclusion I come to at the end is that you’re beautiful
","[7/2/20, 6:27:00 PM] Joe: I enjoy it. Say whatever about whoever haha

","[7/2/20, 6:32:18 PM] Joe: I try to keep the “corniness” to a minimum haha
","[7/2/20, 6:33:07 PM] Joe: But then you know when you hear me being corny that I really like you and I’m willing to sound dumb for you haha
","[7/2/20, 6:33:51 PM] Joe: Hahaha damn this gif makes me think about how little I talked at first every time you send it 😂
","[7/2/20, 6:38:48 PM] Joe: Hahah it’s rare for me to compliment too 😂 I guess you’ve noticed. Well in case I don’t say anything like that for a while, I’ll say it now, I think you’re beautiful and funny and smart. I love your attitude towards life and the fun we have just spending hours talking through WhatsApp haha. I think you’re the best

","[7/4/20, 7:32:14 AM] Joe: Like specific places? So many places to name haha
","[7/4/20, 7:35:50 AM] Joe: But the United States is so big I’ve barely seen much even though I have a decent list I guess. I’ve been to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and New York. Still have a lot I haven’t seen
","[7/4/20, 7:40:39 AM] Joe: I liked Washington the most but I only went in summer. I heard it is cloudy and rainy most of the year
","[7/4/20, 7:41:57 AM] Joe: So I don’t know if I’d like it all year around. Texas was too hot, dry, and flat but at least it is relatively cheap to live there
","[7/4/20, 7:43:25 AM] Joe: New York had too many people. I forgot I also went to New Jersey and Pennsylvania too, same trip as New York. East coast is very densely packed compared to when you go out west.
","[7/4/20, 7:43:51 AM] Joe: Arizona was hot and a hella racist haha
","[7/4/20, 7:45:35 AM] Joe: Oregon is cool. My brother lives there. Great for outdoor stuff. They get snow in the winter, summer and spring are pretty nice. I have to drive a couple of hours to the mountains for snow here.
","[7/4/20, 7:50:06 AM] Joe: Haha Texas is pretty racist too. The whole southern part of the states is kind of racist 😬
","[7/4/20, 7:50:53 AM] Joe: Oh yeah California is really nice. Ideal weather and have access to all kinds of cool places
","[7/4/20, 7:54:34 AM] Joe: Haha no that’s like 8 hours away from me. I rarely go to Southern California
","[7/4/20, 7:56:17 AM] Joe: Also, the water is cold at the beaches here. Not the most pleasant unless it’s super hot. Not like tropical waters at all haha
","[7/4/20, 8:06:05 AM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s far too. A lot beaches you think of are probably around San Diego
","[7/4/20, 8:10:25 AM] Joe: That’s tight! Super far from me though haha. Almost at the California/Mexico border
","[7/4/20, 8:18:26 AM] Joe: Haha a little closer but still Southern California

","[7/4/20, 8:43:33 AM] Joe: It’s rare to drive with moving the gears here haha. Super. Having manual gears is the best security for a car here cause people don’t know how to drive them, so they can’t steal them

","[7/5/20, 8:42:05 AM] Joe: Oh yeah add as many as you can haha. I’ll definitely listen
","[7/5/20, 8:47:12 AM] Joe: Damn you’re already doing it haha adding a bunch of stuff I see. Thanks babe!
","[7/5/20, 8:47:34 AM] Joe: The playlist went from 1 hour to 2 hours haha
","[7/5/20, 8:49:35 AM] Joe: I like this one

","[7/5/20, 8:51:12 AM] Joe: This song sounds like it would be in a montage of a movie. Like a super epic part that’s all feel good and shit 😂
","[7/5/20, 8:54:53 AM] Joe: Hahah damn that’s wild. I haven’t gone to too many concerts but they’re fun. I like the outdoor festivals with concerts haha. Those are fun

","[7/5/20, 9:30:47 AM] Joe: I combed all the curls out haha. You probably didn’t like that look very much 🥴

","[7/5/20, 9:32:54 AM] Joe: But at least the curls came back quick haha
","[7/5/20, 9:34:45 AM] Joe: To be honest though me curls aren’t as awesome as they are in Hawaii. My hair like it there 😂
","[7/5/20, 9:35:00 AM] Joe: All the salt water in the air
","[7/5/20, 9:35:15 AM] Joe: And the humidity

","[7/5/20, 9:54:48 AM] Joe: I always drop it but it just started happening randomly a week or two ago. Very slightly. But now it’s getting worse
","[7/5/20, 10:08:38 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I guess so 🤷‍♂️ hopefully it doesn’t break for a little while longer. Just need a few more weeks

","[7/5/20, 11:56:41 AM] Joe: I haven’t heard all the ones you added yet though. I don’t have premium so they play in a random order haha

","[7/5/20, 12:40:47 PM] Joe: I’ll make sure he takes a video if we ever get this thing done haha
","[7/5/20, 12:58:59 PM] Joe: Haha yeah a little bit. The new song sounds like it would be in a skate video 😆

","[7/5/20, 2:14:51 PM] Joe: Hahah I was actually wondering about that. Confused me for a second
","[7/5/20, 2:15:15 PM] Joe: Fixing this car is taking forever haha I want to drive it!
","[7/5/20, 2:44:02 PM] Joe: I’m alright at fixing stuff but not great at diagnosing the problem. Once I know what it is and how to fix it I can usually do the work
","[7/5/20, 11:04:18 PM] Joe: Buenos días babe! I’m super tired. I never even got to drive the car today 😡 he was having all kinds of problems getting this thing done haha.

","[7/6/20, 6:52:38 AM] Joe: We didn’t set anything up for today. Last time I talked to him he said he would send all the contacts and stuff 🤷‍♂️
","[7/6/20, 6:52:46 AM] Joe: Good idea
","[7/6/20, 6:53:45 AM] Joe: Haha good. I got a super short morning conversation with you just in time 😂

","That’s terrible. I’m sorry to hear that you had to deal with such a rude person today.
","[7/6/20, 12:50:20 PM] Joe: Customers are the worst sometimes
","[7/6/20, 2:22:10 PM] Joe: That's good. It sounds like for the most part the people are alright haha.
","[7/6/20, 2:22:48 PM] Joe: I used to work at a few pharmacies, customers were always in a bad mood 😬
","[7/6/20, 2:23:49 PM] Joe: That dude didn't answer my call. I think i'm over working with this guy 🤬
","[7/6/20, 2:24:44 PM] Joe: I was really looking forward to working on a mobile app but i don't know what to do at this point. So frustrating. What a waste of time
","[7/6/20, 2:26:48 PM] Joe: Haha yeah i had to memorize all the drug names. I worked in pharmacy for like 5 years, i had to do a little school but not much. I wasn't the pharmacist, i was a pharmacy technician, which is like the assistant. Not a fun job hahah
","[7/6/20, 2:27:05 PM] Joe: hahhahaa
","[7/6/20, 2:27:45 PM] Joe: That's what i was worried about. Especially when he sent the NDA but not the contract for the work.
","[7/6/20, 2:28:02 PM] Joe: I still haven't received a contract so yeah, i'm over it haha
","[7/6/20, 2:28:24 PM] Joe: True
","[7/6/20, 2:29:59 PM] Joe: Part of my job was to literally not answer questions like that, by law i had to get the pharmacist to recommend medication. I will tell you what i think would help if you ask me hahaha but at work i had to get a pharmacist even if i knew the answer
","[7/6/20, 2:31:36 PM] Joe: Yeah i already wasted a bunch of time waiting for him.
","[7/6/20, 2:31:57 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah for you i will answer
","[7/6/20, 2:32:09 PM] Joe: Never
","[7/6/20, 2:33:18 PM] Joe: Yeah i'm not too worried about it. I'm just going to keep working on what i can for now. My boss actually said he has a coding job he needs done for his other skate camp haha.
","[7/6/20, 2:35:30 PM] Joe: hahaha
","[7/6/20, 2:35:36 PM] Joe: 😂😂
","[7/6/20, 2:36:17 PM] Joe: I tried not to get too excited about that job anyway.
","[7/6/20, 2:36:57 PM] Joe: ugh
","[7/6/20, 2:36:59 PM] Joe: whack
","[7/6/20, 2:37:17 PM] Joe: I did want to get paid though haha
","[7/6/20, 2:38:41 PM] Joe: Yeaaaaah. Whatever it's cool
","[7/6/20, 2:38:48 PM] Joe: Life goes on haha
","[7/6/20, 2:39:06 PM] Joe: They pay better than that
","[7/6/20, 2:39:49 PM] Joe: That was mid-tier pay i would say. At least for the Bay Area but cost of living is crazy high here too so it makes sense
","[7/6/20, 2:40:50 PM] Joe: They are paying for the time it took me to learn everything 😂😂
","[7/6/20, 2:42:06 PM] Joe: Graphic designer, user interface designer, user experience designer all get very high pay too and can be remote
","[7/6/20, 2:42:14 PM] Joe: You would be good at those jobs
","[7/6/20, 2:43:34 PM] Joe: I really want to see how well you could design websites if you learned how to use the right tools and spent a tiny amount of time studying it. You already have a good eye which is hard to teach
","[7/6/20, 2:44:40 PM] Joe: My designs suuuuuck!
","[7/6/20, 2:45:59 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[7/6/20, 2:46:09 PM] Joe: Damn you're right we haven't played in a while
","[7/6/20, 2:47:00 PM] Joe: I think you would like it too. The way you would send me revisions to my designs, it seemed like you were enjoying it.
","[7/6/20, 2:48:00 PM] Joe: I'm sure the 3D course can be tied into web design. You can make 3D assets for websites i bet hahah all kinds of crazy stuff needed on websites now
","[7/6/20, 2:49:32 PM] Joe: It was honestly one of the things that made me like you a lot more haha. I could just feel your passion about trying to make it look nice. You weren't being paid, you didn't have to do it, but you wanted to and you tried to do a good job regardless. I appreciated that a lot.
","[7/6/20, 2:51:25 PM] Joe: https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/adding-3d-models-to-your-website-d374a8cbbadd
","[7/6/20, 2:51:37 PM] Joe: the article makes it seem not that hard haha
","[7/6/20, 2:52:02 PM] Joe: Give me 3D model files of like a small object and i might be able to figure it out hahah
","[7/6/20, 2:52:47 PM] Joe: But what i was saying was you could just do the 3D modeling part as a part of a team. You'd send the file of the 3D model to the programmer to insert into the website
","[7/6/20, 2:54:43 PM] Joe: I'm trying to find an example haha
","[7/6/20, 2:56:07 PM] Joe: Yes
","[7/6/20, 2:56:29 PM] Joe: Have you ever been to a website that lets you rotate a 3D image to look at all sides of it?
","[7/6/20, 2:56:46 PM] Joe: You would be the one to make that 3D model
","[7/6/20, 2:56:58 PM] Joe: I can't find an example right now
","[7/6/20, 2:58:04 PM] Joe: Yeah it seems frustrating. Probably why it pays well hah
","[7/6/20, 2:58:48 PM] Joe: Well if you are ever desperate for a job that uses your new 3D modeling skills, look into it
","[7/6/20, 2:59:32 PM] Joe: They can be short jobs to pad the resume haha. But i would support whatever you do 🤷‍♂️
","[7/6/20, 3:00:42 PM] Joe: Aaah ok ok. You still need to send me more of your work so i can see it haha
","[7/6/20, 3:01:48 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that's true. Back to real life haha
","[7/6/20, 3:02:11 PM] Joe: That's cool you started it during quarantine though
","[7/6/20, 3:02:57 PM] Joe: I'm sure you'll get it eventually. It'll just be a little slower than before
","[7/6/20, 3:03:12 PM] Joe: Let me know when you're ready for dice and we will play again hahah
","[7/6/20, 3:03:50 PM] Joe: Maybe when it's not so late there
","[7/6/20, 3:05:26 PM] Joe: Definitely. I understand. I work best in the morning time so having to work camp in the morning makes it harder for me to do well with my programming.
","[7/6/20, 3:06:08 PM] Joe: Oh we can play haha i just thought it was late there and you might want to go to sleep
","[7/6/20, 3:06:31 PM] Joe: Or maybe not go to sleep yet, but not get kept up late by my dumb game 😂
","[7/6/20, 3:07:35 PM] Joe: haha then let's play 😈
","[7/6/20, 3:09:07 PM] Joe: Haha what's the room name?
","[7/6/20, 3:09:50 PM] Joe: Hahahahah dammit
","[7/6/20, 3:10:12 PM] Joe: Oh i know the name. You're on mobile though so it was probably a capital ""O""
","[7/6/20, 3:11:36 PM] Joe: Hahaha
","[7/6/20, 3:11:43 PM] Joe: It's ok. You are right in the end
","[7/6/20, 3:12:11 PM] Joe: Aaah you got disconnected. My game still sucks. Sweet
","[7/6/20, 3:13:44 PM] Joe: Ok i made it. Lower case ""o""
","[7/6/20, 3:14:32 PM] Joe: Siii
","[7/6/20, 3:16:08 PM] Joe: Oh haha yeah mobile is weird when entering the name of stuff for some reason
","[7/6/20, 3:28:39 PM] Joe: I did too well hahah sorry 😬 I'll fix those dice on mobile, put them all in a row. Thanks for the tip!
","[7/6/20, 3:29:55 PM] Joe: Hmmm interesting. Maybe there is a border on the dice or something? I'll try to fix that
","[7/6/20, 3:31:31 PM] Joe: Oooooh yup that's probably a border or shadow setting. So it should just be flat looking dice right? No shadow or border would be better?
","[7/6/20, 3:34:18 PM] Joe: You got disconnected from my room haha
","[7/6/20, 3:34:32 PM] Joe: A while ago. That happens on mobile when you close the browser sometimes
","[7/6/20, 3:35:28 PM] Joe: Nooooo totally disconnected. I know it doesn't look like it but that is only because my game sucks hahah
","[7/6/20, 3:36:01 PM] Joe: hahah ok i wait
","[7/6/20, 3:45:57 PM] Joe: Aaah disconnected.
","[7/6/20, 3:46:01 PM] Joe: Was fun though hahah
","[7/6/20, 3:46:41 PM] Joe: Oh your phone tried to reload the website i think
","[7/6/20, 3:47:19 PM] Joe: I still haven't figured out how to fix that. Something to do with mobile. It never happens on computer. Or at least i haven't experienced it on a computer
","[7/6/20, 3:48:14 PM] Joe: I should make an actual app for use on mobile phones. That way i can teach myself that technology i was supposed to be using and hopefully fix some of these weird issues that happen with mobile browsers
","[7/6/20, 3:56:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry babe my dad was telling me something. I was distracted! I miss you I swear!!! Hahaha

","[7/7/20, 12:40:10 PM] Joe: No wait....it was “chocho” I learned. Damn there is a lot of ways to say it haha

","[7/7/20, 12:48:23 PM] Joe: Aaah ok. Noted. So I’m guessing you would use the word concha most out of all the options??
","[7/7/20, 12:56:35 PM] Joe: Haha the memes teach me a lot. Memes, music, and tv shows are my main sources of learning besides talking to you  😂
","[7/7/20, 12:57:38 PM] Joe: I’ll try to remember that haha
","[7/7/20, 12:59:03 PM] Joe: Dude my pinky finger hurts so bad. I think I sprained it 😣 I don’t know, it hurts to bend it now. I’m always injured haha
","[7/7/20, 1:02:18 PM] Joe: Hahaha thanks 😂
","[7/7/20, 1:02:54 PM] Joe: I just watch La Casa De Papel over and over hahaha and when I watch something in English I put Spanish subtitles
","[7/7/20, 1:03:20 PM] Joe: Or if it has the option i put the audio in spanish if I’m watching a movie or something
","[7/7/20, 1:04:25 PM] Joe: From earlier today. It’s just swollen like I jammed it. It’ll be fine in a few days

","[7/7/20, 1:07:29 PM] Joe: To answer your Instagram question....I can barely understand those people. Only some of what they are saying. I don’t understand most of it haha
","[7/7/20, 1:09:01 PM] Joe: I know she was asking people about if they send pictures of their cock and later if the women sent pictures of their pussy. And I understand some of the responses but most of the time I’m lost haha

","[7/7/20, 1:18:46 PM] Joe: Yeah it would be nice if everyone could just be honest without feeling super judged.
","[7/7/20, 1:23:40 PM] Joe: Hahah yeah that was good. You had the last one right. “Coochie” haha
","[7/7/20, 1:31:57 PM] Joe: I listened to this so many times 😂 but yeah that’s crazy stuff like that is still going on. Poor education or bad parenting, who knows but hopefully the world is moving in the right direction over time
","[7/7/20, 1:32:51 PM] Joe: You look good to me as usual
","[7/7/20, 1:47:49 PM] Joe: Lonely Lore haha. How long are they gone for?
","[7/7/20, 1:48:53 PM] Joe: Oh yeah after the 1000th time listening I understood the situation. Super messed up what he did!
","[7/7/20, 1:50:10 PM] Joe: They made a law here in the states that would classify what he did as “revenge porn” since he posted nudes cause that kind of stuff was a huge problem. Now you can go to jail for doing stuff like that.
","[7/7/20, 1:52:44 PM] Joe: Oh damn so you’re alone for a few days then. Well....with only Rogel haha
","[7/7/20, 1:54:07 PM] Joe: Holy shit, gnarly. Yeah I think it is a good law. Especially with how people send those kind of pictures or videos to each other nowadays. Very common.
","[7/7/20, 1:54:21 PM] Joe: Shit....you even got me to send a video 😬
","[7/7/20, 1:55:38 PM] Joe: The protection is needed though. So many people do messed up stuff like share those pictures or videos when they get upset or breakup with a person. Or they send it to a friend and it spreads fast. Either way, people are messed up sometimes
","[7/7/20, 1:56:04 PM] Joe: I have all the trust in the world for you
","[7/7/20, 2:01:53 PM] Joe: I hope you are never in that situation but I feel like you would handle it well and the boy would end up regretting his decision
","[7/7/20, 2:02:37 PM] Joe: What you send to me is for my eyes only! I’d never show anyone haha

","[7/7/20, 2:14:22 PM] Joe: Hahah I am not sexy like you though 😂
","[7/7/20, 2:17:17 PM] Joe: It’s easier when you make a request haha. I don’t even know what is sexy to you hahah. Fuck I’m the worst 🤦‍♂️

","[7/7/20, 2:37:49 PM] Joe: cause i do
","[7/7/20, 2:47:08 PM] Joe: Haha I’m easily provoked by you. I’m really sorry. Half of it is me being shy and not knowing what to even send you. And the other half is the schedule. I’m hornier in the morning and evening I guess 🤷‍♂️
","[7/7/20, 2:47:49 PM] Joe: Ejsoixdjeis I feel like I disappoint you haha fuck 🤦‍♂️
","[7/7/20, 2:53:44 PM] Joe: I can’t lie, morning sex is kind of my favorite 🙊🙈
","[7/7/20, 2:55:02 PM] Joe: Haha it’s just a little more work to get in the mood in the middle of the day 😆 plus I get so sleepy afterwards hahaha

","[7/7/20, 3:16:01 PM] Joe: We’ll have to meet in Costa Rica haha
","[7/7/20, 3:18:04 PM] Joe: Even if everything goes to shit and we can’t be together I’ll visit you someday. Even if it’s far in the future and we can only be friends I would still love to visit you. But that’s not what I want. I want to see you sooner rather than later haha
","[7/7/20, 3:18:46 PM] Joe: I’m trying to do all I can to get to you but the situation of the world is fucked. I have one goal right now haha get to Spain to see you
","[7/7/20, 3:29:57 PM] Joe: I really really don’t want to just be friends. I just don’t want to keep you waiting for too long haha it’s hard to explain. 
","
","But you’re who I want and I want you as more than a friend.
","[7/7/20, 3:32:29 PM] Joe: You’re right. It’ll happen eventually! But It feels like it has been so long already that we’ve been talking. I just really want to go to you now haha the ultimate test of patience 😂
","[7/8/20, 1:01:39 AM] Joe: All good. I was sleeping well until my aunt from Hawaii arrived haha. My dad just picked her up from the airport. They’re in the other room talking hellaaaa loud!

","[7/8/20, 1:41:21 AM] Joe: It makes me wonder if they are just wearing it to be technically following the rules, but they really don’t want to wear it. Or if they’re just not very educated and don’t know what they’re doing. I guess the answer could be a little of both haha
","[7/8/20, 1:48:03 AM] Joe: Yeah I have a lot of family that works in hospitals so I don’t appreciate people’s negligence haha
","[7/8/20, 1:48:52 AM] Joe: And I really want to have my own business one day. It’s super difficult as it is. I can’t imagine having something I worked hard to build get crushed because of something completely out of my control
","[7/8/20, 1:50:59 AM] Joe: My family has been pretty good about staying home. And no one really visits my grandparents right now cause they’re scared to get them sick
","[7/8/20, 1:51:55 AM] Joe: I don’t know. But I don’t like working for other people and I feel like I can find someway to create value in the world
","[7/8/20, 1:53:48 AM] Joe: Mmm well technically I already started a business. I have one for my freelance coding stuff.
","[7/8/20, 1:54:54 AM] Joe: But yeah other than that, maybe a store, online and/or in real life, not sure. But I don’t know what I would sell haha.

","[7/8/20, 12:30:24 PM] Joe: Haha same when I’m a dad. I don’t think it’s on purpose. The parents and even the kids might think they’ll like it but when they find out how hard it is and how much they get hurt some lose interest
","[7/8/20, 12:31:34 PM] Joe: It’s two kids that are in camp this week. Honestly they’re some of my least favorite kids haha but the parents are paying good
","[7/8/20, 12:39:55 PM] Joe: Hahahah this kid is so stoked!

","[7/9/20, 1:17:49 PM] Joe: Haha that’s a relief 😅
","[7/9/20, 1:18:48 PM] Joe: I think I like working at the skatepark too much hahah all I do is skate around or sit all day haha. I used to use them time to learn stuff when they’d let me sit in the building but now i have to be in the park or at the front all the time
","[7/9/20, 1:36:40 PM] Joe: Haha thanks. Getting paid to skate is awesome. The only time it’s not fun is when a parent gets mad when I tell them their kid can’t ride a scooter or bike at the park haha
","[7/9/20, 1:37:25 PM] Joe: Some people get so upset when I tell them no but I’m just doing my job 🤷‍♂️
","[7/9/20, 1:42:56 PM] Joe: Mmmm 4 years now
","[7/9/20, 1:43:40 PM] Joe: Well I’ve been working 4 years at the skatepark but I’ve only done 3 years of lessons. The first year I just did monitoring of the park
","[7/9/20, 1:59:15 PM] Joe: Haha yeah and every time I leave I tell them not to fire me so I can work next summer if I come back.
","[7/9/20, 2:59:47 PM] Joe: Some lady just asked me to tutor her kid 😂 like not in skateboarding but actually tutor them for school haha. Weird
","[7/9/20, 3:47:13 PM] Joe: Hahahah whaaaat??
","[7/9/20, 3:49:40 PM] Joe: The kids mom talked to me today while I was monitoring the park and asked if I would be interested in tutoring her son. He isn’t in camp or anything. I’ve seen that kid at the park a few times and his mom knows that he likes me so she thought it would be easier for me to teach him his school stuff instead of her 😂
","[7/9/20, 3:56:01 PM] Joe: Hahaha you look hella sleepy
","[7/9/20, 3:59:31 PM] Joe: Haha yeah you look beautiful as always!
","[7/9/20, 4:00:24 PM] Joe: I am a little worried about how much work teaching actual school work is going to be haha
","[7/9/20, 4:00:55 PM] Joe: But I’m willing to try it out and see how it goes. We’ll do like 25 minutes of school then take a skateboard break and repeat haha
","‎[7/9/20, 4:04:09 PM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[7/9/20, 4:06:47 PM] Joe: No this would be a new thing. The mom just asked me this today and got my phone number. The kid is not a part of camp. It would probably be in the afternoon after I’m done working camp
","[7/9/20, 4:11:47 PM] Joe: Ooh haha sorry. I’m worried because teaching school work isn’t the same as teaching skateboarding. Or maybe it is? I don’t know haha.
","[7/9/20, 4:12:51 PM] Joe: I just don’t want to do a bad job and it would be my first time doing something like that
","[7/9/20, 4:14:51 PM] Joe: Yeah she wants me to help him study and do school work. With skateboarding breaks in between.
","[7/9/20, 4:15:16 PM] Joe: She said she was having a hard time getting him interested in learning anything for school during quarantine
","[7/9/20, 4:15:46 PM] Joe: Actually she said “I tried to teach him for the first 2 months of quarantine and we almost killed each other” 😬
","[7/9/20, 4:16:40 PM] Joe: He is in 1st grade so everything I have to teach him is supposed to be easy
","[7/9/20, 4:17:02 PM] Joe: Not sure how old first grade is. 6 or 7 maybe?
","[7/9/20, 4:19:13 PM] Joe: Yeah she sounded like she needed help haha. But also she is a white lady and her kid is brown and she was like “I think it would be good for an older boy to help him. Especially someone that looks like him. And he seems to have gravitated towards you”.

","I’m down to try it 🤷‍♂️
","[7/9/20, 4:20:17 PM] Joe: We’re going to schedule something when I’m not working the skatepark. I don’t think we’ll be at the skatepark when I teach him either. Probably just going to skate near his house
","[7/9/20, 4:21:52 PM] Joe: Yeah that’s what it is. I mean we also do “kindergarten” but that’s more like daycare disguised as school for 5 year olds haha
","[7/9/20, 4:25:47 PM] Joe: Haha hopefully. I’ll let you know how it goes. She might not even contact me 🤷‍♂️
","[7/9/20, 4:27:19 PM] Joe: She’ll flake like the other guy haha and the only ones who will be true to their word is the 2 little devils I’m supposed to give skate lessons to hahaha I’m really thinking about cancelling those lessons. Those kids are not pleasant 😂

","[7/11/20, 8:48:50 AM] Joe: Super plain
","[7/11/20, 9:01:30 AM] Joe: Hahaha we do like our doughnuts. It’s weirdly considered a breakfast food here 😂
","[7/11/20, 9:02:12 AM] Joe: Hahah spanish way of spelling it makes more sense.
","[7/11/20, 10:01:41 AM] Joe: Haha noooo. Usually eggs and avocados or something like that.
","[7/11/20, 10:02:38 AM] Joe: Doughnuts are too sweet for me to eat for breakfast most of the time. I was definitely eating a lot of pancakes when I was staying with my sister but haven’t had any since I came back to California
","[7/11/20, 10:25:09 AM] Joe: Hahaha I eat relatively healthy....for an American 😂
","[7/11/20, 11:11:07 AM] Joe: I actually just watched a video recently about Americans weird sugary breakfasts. We eat super sweet and/or heavy breakfast compared to the rest of the world. The pictures of breakfast you send me always look super light and healthy compared to what is typical here

","[7/11/20, 12:16:38 PM] Joe: So shitty haha
","[7/11/20, 12:32:28 PM] Joe: Damn that would suuuuck. It seems like a possibility though. I really hope this doesn’t last that long.
","[7/11/20, 12:32:40 PM] Joe: 2 years of this madness is too much haha

","[7/11/20, 12:59:18 PM] Joe: I can’t wait to hear you say, “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida” ahahaha
","[7/11/20, 1:00:20 PM] Joe: Oh yeah that’s right.
","[7/11/20, 1:00:41 PM] Joe: I probably did the appointment before camp started so that was at least 4 weeks ago

","[7/11/20, 4:11:37 PM] Joe: Whenever that’s an option I choose you every time haha no doubt

","[7/11/20, 4:18:07 PM] Joe: Aaah that’s a tough situation. Working hard, being tired, stress from COVID stuff. Not a great combination
","[7/11/20, 4:20:44 PM] Joe: If we have a fight I’ll have to send you messages or write you a letter cause I won’t know how to express myself well enough haha shit
","[7/11/20, 4:22:41 PM] Joe: Yeah i guess it sounds like Gastón could do a little more. Or at least seem more concerned? But I’m sure he is tired as well which makes it hard

","[7/11/20, 11:57:34 PM] Joe: Maybe a little too comfortable apparently 😆
","[7/12/20, 12:11:28 AM] Joe: Interesting. I didn’t realize having a lot of carpet is kind of an American thing. Americans must be a strange bunch to the rest of the world haha
","[7/12/20, 12:29:50 AM] Joe: Now i am just wondering what other things seem common to me but are actually not super common haha. Like how we have mostly automatic gears in our cars. I didn’t realize automatics are less common in other places
","[7/12/20, 12:31:30 AM] Joe: We’re actually taking out a lot of the carpet and putting in hardwood floors. Carpet is nice but it is difficult to keep it looking nice for years

","[7/12/20, 3:10:28 PM] Joe: Super random....some lady came by the skatepark with a hella big dog. A Tibetan mastiff. She said it didn’t like Chinese people. I thought that was weird haha. But it was so fluffy. I wish I would’ve taken a picture

","[7/12/20, 3:16:25 PM] Joe: My board hit my leg super hard. I didn’t think it was very bad but it’s been a few hours and it still hurts so i decided to ice it
","[7/12/20, 3:19:42 PM] Joe: Well she explained that he dog doesn’t like people that are afraid of it.
","[7/12/20, 3:20:26 PM] Joe: I asked one of my friends and he said that dog is like a guard dog in China often. It’s seen as an aggressive breed to many, like how Americans see pit bulls as aggressive.
","[7/12/20, 3:21:29 PM] Joe: But, she hella pulled the dog away when my Asian homie came up even though he wasn’t afraid of the dog haha so that made me question that lady and how she is training the dog
","[7/12/20, 3:24:17 PM] Joe: Woooah! It wasn’t as big as that huge one but it was just as fluffy looking
","[7/12/20, 3:24:42 PM] Joe: Actually it was probably pretty close in size to that dog. Just a tiny bit smaller
","[7/12/20, 3:27:01 PM] Joe: He had a big giant eye booger hahah but he was cool. The owner was surprised he liked me and had to take a picture for the trainer 😂

","[7/15/20, 7:36:38 AM] Joe: The funny thing is, my friends that have kids are the super irresponsible friends haha. The friends that we guessed would’ve been the last to have kids had kids first haha
","[7/15/20, 7:37:40 AM] Joe: I don’t want to take care of everyone else’s kids haha I want to make my own kids cool
","[7/15/20, 7:41:30 AM] Joe: I guess it makes sense. They had the kids on accident which matches their irresponsible personalities hahaa
","[7/15/20, 7:44:12 AM] Joe: Haha yeah I thought it would be weird to tell you but that’s what I’ve been feeling lately. Probably from just being around kids so much and trying to help them learn.
","[7/15/20, 7:45:39 AM] Joe: I don’t know. Am I supposed to want other things at this age? I feel like I want to be a dad 😂
","‎[7/15/20, 7:47:24 AM] Joe: ‎GIF omitted
","[7/15/20, 7:50:42 AM] Joe: Haha that makes sense. What would you say is a typical age to have kids in Spain?
","[7/15/20, 7:52:28 AM] Joe: Hmmm I don’t know if I would adopt. Maybe if that was my only option haha I wouldn’t be totally against it. If I knew I’d never have a kid I’d probably adopt at that point
","[7/15/20, 7:53:05 AM] Joe: Damn that’s pretty late haha. Everyone in Spain has old ass parents 😆
","[7/15/20, 7:54:21 AM] Joe: Haha yeah it would be my preference to have my own. Little mini me hahaha
","[7/15/20, 7:55:54 AM] Joe: My friend’s son looks hella like me. Super similar hair and everything. Seeing that little dude hella makes me want my own little dude haha
","[7/15/20, 7:58:03 AM] Joe: They came after it got dark. I sent a Instagram post with his kids
","[7/15/20, 8:01:31 AM] Joe: I want a little one 😩
","[7/15/20, 8:02:02 AM] Joe: Ok ok I’m sorry enough of that. I’ll get over it hahaha. Alright babe I have to go to work now. I hope you have a wonderful day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
","[7/15/20, 8:03:39 AM] Joe: Fuck. Too cute haha
","[7/15/20, 8:03:45 AM] Joe: 😂
","[7/15/20, 8:06:42 AM] Joe: 😩
","[7/15/20, 12:00:16 PM] Joe: It’s going well. Just waiting for the last 2 kids to get picked up and I can get some lunch before starting the private lesson
","[7/15/20, 12:13:53 PM] Joe: The private lesson wasn’t actually that bad. The kids were better behaved compared to when they were at camp. I think it’s because the park had a lot of adults skating so they weren’t as comfortable.
","[7/15/20, 12:19:07 PM] Joe: The private lesson for today starts at 1. Yesterday’s lesson went well
","[7/15/20, 12:21:00 PM] Joe: Yeah it’s not so bad. We’ll see how many weeks I continue doing these lessons for. I have some other people trying to get lessons too. Going to start a bidding war haha
","[7/15/20, 12:24:03 PM] Joe: Actually I’ve been thinking I need to increase my prices for private lessons. I have a friend that does them and he charges almost twice what I charge haha
","[7/15/20, 12:28:12 PM] Joe: Yeah I charge about that much. $30-40 per hour. But my friend charges $60+ per hour and has no trouble getting lessons
","[7/15/20, 12:31:02 PM] Joe: Yeah he also teaches children. He is probably about the same level of skating as me.
","[7/15/20, 12:31:31 PM] Joe: Nothing. He just asked for that much. Parents have a lot of money around here haha
","[7/15/20, 12:31:48 PM] Joe: Have you seen Orange Is The New Black on Netflix?
","[7/15/20, 12:32:32 PM] Joe: One of the kids that I’m giving private lessons to said his mom wrote the book and sold it to Netflix. So I’m assuming his mom is the main character and also very rich hahaa
","[7/15/20, 12:33:33 PM] Joe: Oh yeah for sure haha. I’m getting $70 hour but I have to watch 2 kids haha. That should be the price for just 1
","[7/15/20, 12:39:12 PM] Joe: I think 60 and 50 for two is probably reasonable.
","[7/15/20, 12:40:37 PM] Joe: That’s probably true. I know one guy that would charge $100 per hour. He was really good instructor but very expensive
","[7/15/20, 12:45:48 PM] Joe: I guess it depends on the goal. If the parents basically want a babysitter $100 is too much. But if they’re actually trying to get their kid to the next level and progress it’s not super unreasonable. It doesn’t take a crazy amount of hours to get a lot of improvement so it seems worth it.
","[7/15/20, 12:46:55 PM] Joe: The parents of these kids seem like they want a babysitter and it’s just a bonus that I can skate with the kids while doing it haha.

","[7/16/20, 6:42:19 AM] Joe: The mountains are such a constant feature in the background here that I sometimes don’t even notice them anymore. But when I go somewhere without mountains i definitely notice they’re missing haha

","[7/16/20, 1:55:50 PM] Joe: I was going to say it looks like a fishing hat haha
","[7/16/20, 2:14:33 PM] Joe: Hahah dude I was just thinking I need to start bringing a hat 🧢
","[7/16/20, 2:15:03 PM] Joe: You look great in the hat hahah wear it wherever you want

","[7/16/20, 3:08:42 PM] Joe: I’m finally free! No lessons after work tomorrow so it’ll be an easy short day

","[7/16/20, 10:23:40 PM] Joe: Yeah you should definitely do that some day haha. I love going out when there is very few people out. It’s especially interesting in bigger cities that you usually see very full. Completely different vibe haha
","[7/16/20, 10:28:37 PM] Joe: Haha that’s also true. Well I hope you have a good day at work. You’ll probably be getting off around the time I wake up 🙄
","[7/16/20, 10:29:22 PM] Joe: hahaha Is this where we meet?
","[7/16/20, 10:32:41 PM] Joe: Sounds like a plan haha I’d be super stoked to get back to island life haha 🌴
","[7/16/20, 10:34:12 PM] Joe: It would be great if my passport would show up. And if they would open up travel 😑
","
","I’m ready to go!
","[7/16/20, 10:41:32 PM] Joe: A lot of people knowing English would be great. I still need to know my spanish for you though haha most important.
","[7/16/20, 10:42:35 PM] Joe: Oh yeah things are closing again in some states. Cases are going up. They’re considering whether or not to open schools after summer.
","[7/16/20, 10:43:46 PM] Joe: I think in the city I work they decided they’ll do 8 weeks of online classes at least to start the school year.
","[7/16/20, 10:52:38 PM] Joe: Shiiiiit
","[7/16/20, 10:54:00 PM] Joe: For real! Fuck. This is some ridiculous shit. If I was just “allowed” to go, I’d be there so soon.

","[7/16/20, 10:58:15 PM] Joe: Hahahaha
","[7/16/20, 10:59:00 PM] Joe: I appreciate it. I’m still going. I still tell people I’m trying to get to Spain when they ask when I’m going back to Hawaii haha
","[7/16/20, 11:00:17 PM] Joe: I know you said you won’t stop talking to me...but if for some reason this went on for years and you actually did stop talking to me, I’d still go to Spain the first chance I get hahaa. I can’t not go
","[7/16/20, 11:01:10 PM] Joe: No I’m not going back to Hawaii. I’m going to you haha.
","[7/16/20, 11:01:38 PM] Joe: It better not be years. It was an extreme hypothetical situation haha
","[7/16/20, 11:02:47 PM] Joe: Hahah I’m just saying. I’m going to Spain no matter what. I need to go at this point 😆
","[7/16/20, 11:04:40 PM] Joe: Haha well besides seeing you, which is what I really want...I’ve also grown super fond of the idea of going to a country and learning more spanish. But like you said, it would be good for me to learn with you 😊
","[7/16/20, 11:06:20 PM] Joe: Yesss haha you should definitely do that. We’ll see who can get to the other fastest. Though I’m pretty sure I’ll win this race haha

","[7/17/20, 6:36:07 AM] Joe: Hahah ok I understand hueco now 😂 thank you. I have to get up and take a shower now.
","[7/17/20, 7:21:16 AM] Joe: Yeah I guess getting off early is pretty great. I used to always close when I was a pharmacy tech and sometimes I forget how much I hated it. I could never really do stuff after work cause I got off too late
","[7/17/20, 7:33:15 AM] Joe: Hahah true! Never again 😂

","[7/17/20, 12:16:06 PM] Joe: The kids were being wild today hahaha I’m tired 😓
","[7/17/20, 12:39:24 PM] Joe: Hahaha this is what today felt like. Some of the kids are so much work 😂
","[7/17/20, 12:40:41 PM] Joe: Especially if they decide you’re the “fun” counselor haha cause then they follow you around all day. They say my name so often hahaha it’s like my name being yelled is a constant background sound all day long haha
","[7/17/20, 12:42:13 PM] Joe: Hahah sweet! I made it into your dream 😆 I hope it was a good dream haha
","[7/17/20, 12:44:42 PM] Joe: Hahah I just want my own kid to annoy me. Not like 10 kids that aren’t mine all at once 😂

","[7/17/20, 3:00:10 PM] Joe: Damn learning the 3D stuff with someone sounds way better than learning alone. I wish I had a friend to learn how to code with.  It would’ve helped a lot.
","[7/17/20, 3:00:24 PM] Joe: That’s really good though. I’m glad you stuck it out until you got it done haha
","[7/17/20, 3:00:45 PM] Joe: Yeah I’ll just pretend she is protecting me, not ignoring me 😂
