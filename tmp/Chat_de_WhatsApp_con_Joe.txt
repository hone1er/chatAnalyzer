24/4/20 19:05 - Joe: Alright I guess I’m up. I was trying to go back to sleep for an more than an hour but it wasn’t happening
24/4/20 19:17 - Lorena: Buenos días!
24/4/20 19:17 - Lorena: haha poor joe!  sleepless like a little boy when he can't nap.. jjj
24/4/20 19:18 - Lorena: In the end you have installed WhatsApp!  thanks for that, cute!
24/4/20 19:25 - Joe: Haha I told you I was downloading it!
24/4/20 19:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/4/20 19:28 - Joe: Yeah I don’t know why I can’t just stay asleep 😴
24/4/20 19:29 - Lorena: 😍 Are you there?
24/4/20 19:31 - Joe: Si
24/4/20 19:31 - Joe: Might as well get out since I couldn’t sleep I guess
24/4/20 19:32 - Lorena: A que hora es normal despertarse allí? En España a las 7-8 significa madrugar, es para ir a trabajar. La gente normal, suele despertarse entre 9-10. A partir de las 11 es gente muy dormilona jaja. En Costa Rica la hora normal para despertarse era las 7 ( como 9-10 España, hora que ya hay sol y es más difícil dormir)
24/4/20 19:38 - Joe: I wake up with the sun no matter where I am hahaha

But I think most people here would say 9-10 is normal. I’m weird 😂
24/4/20 20:00 - Lorena: Haha It's okey, It's you. The body rules
24/4/20 20:07 - Lorena: Are you near the beach, right? What's the name of the place where do you live?
24/4/20 20:11 - Joe: Oh yeah super close to the beach haha. I have to drive nicest beaches but there are some decent small beaches I can walk or skate to.
24/4/20 20:11 - Joe: The town is called Kailua-Kona
24/4/20 20:32 - Lorena: Que suerte, estás en el sitio perfecto. Eso de tener la playa tan cerca es un sueño! Ví alguna foto en Google jjj disfrútalo!
24/4/20 20:49 - Joe: Thanks! Before quarantine I was skating to the beach everyday and I was loving it. Definitely need a beach near by wherever I end up.
24/4/20 20:51 - Joe: Haha yeah Kailua is kind of a tourist town but it’s cool and really mellow compared to Honolulu
24/4/20 21:08 - Lorena: the boy skates on the beach 🤤 haha.. and now you can't go skating?
24/4/20 21:09 - Lorena: If it looks nice, although better without tourists, surely there are more solitary places. Honolulu seems to me too 😷
24/4/20 21:15 - Joe: I can’t skate into town where all the good skate spots are now and I can’t skate to the good beaches either but it’s ok to skate down the road. Skating the road is fine for exercise but I want to actually skate fun spots 😂
24/4/20 21:17 - Joe: I’ve never been to Honolulu but I doubt I would like it haha. Too many humans and it’s like a fake Hawaii. 

The other side of the island I’m on has the best nature spots. Beautiful waterfalls and forest  🌳
24/4/20 21:39 - Lorena: fun places like skatepark?  where are you there is nothing fun you can invent?  wall, railings or something? 👀🛹
24/4/20 21:44 - Lorena: haha good thought ..We look alike enough, If I go someday, I hope I can get to know part of the island with you, those natural places 🚐🗺️🏝️
24/4/20 21:48 - Joe: There isn’t much near me but the main road and some hotels. The fun places are just random spots downtown. Ledges, benches, rails, & stairs but they’re all in an area we’re not supposed to be.
24/4/20 21:50 - Joe: I’d love to show it to you anytime ☺️
24/4/20 22:22 - Lorena: Ahhhh bien, ahora lo entendí! Jjj
24/4/20 22:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/4/20 22:27 - Joe: Hahahahaha
24/4/20 22:32 - Joe: So what time do you normally get up in the mornings(when you don’t have to do your course)? Do you like to sleep in?
24/4/20 22:50 - Lorena: me gustan demasiado los gifts, lo siento..no puedo creer como me controlé, solo te envié uno jajajaja
24/4/20 22:55 - Lorena: I love sleeping, but I also like to take advantage of the mornings, it is one of my favorite times of the day, breakfast and light. I usually wake up early, but I stay in bed quite a bit lazy. haha I get out of bed at 10.. it depends on the moment hahaha
24/4/20 23:01 - Joe: eso está bien, enviar todos los gifs jaja no se detienen
24/4/20 23:05 - Joe: That’s cool. I might stay in bed longer if I had a reason to hahaha

But for now I’m up with the sun and the birds ☀️ I would probably be considered a “morning person”
24/4/20 23:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 0:03 - Lorena: Ay, se me había apagado el teléfono, y me estaba tomando una cervecita jaja
25/4/20 0:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 0:10 - Lorena: Jajaja no estoy durmiendo aún. Pero quién te dio eso? Jaja camellos por la calle?
25/4/20 0:11 - Joe: cuidado, usted podría obtener lo que usted pide jaja
25/4/20 0:12 - Lorena: Hahah I like "morning person"
25/4/20 0:13 - Joe: I don’t know who it was hahaha I must look like I smoke 😂 💨
25/4/20 0:16 - Lorena: Jajaja puede ser, los pelos te delatan. Que rico, cuánto te costó? 💲
25/4/20 0:20 - Joe: It was free! They just gave it to me. It was weird but I’ll take it haha
25/4/20 0:20 - Lorena: Usted es muy formal para personas mayores. Se diría "tu"en España, aunque yo digo  "vos", por que soy uruguaya .
25/4/20 0:20 - Lorena: Free?? 🤨
25/4/20 0:21 - Joe: Muchas gracias 🙏🏽
25/4/20 0:21 - Joe: Yeah 🤷🏽‍♂️
25/4/20 0:21 - Joe: People are nice out here haha
25/4/20 0:21 - Lorena: who gave it to you boy or girl? Hahah
25/4/20 0:21 - Joe: It was an older couple driving by in their car 🚗
25/4/20 0:22 - Lorena: Vos tenés que decir "vos" como yo ...✌️
25/4/20 0:23 - Lorena: Joe, so weird!!! Be careful haaha
25/4/20 0:24 - Joe: Am I going to get murdered?? 😱
25/4/20 0:25 - Joe: Cause to strangers on the internet and taking weed from old people seems like a good way to get murdered hahahaha I better shape up
25/4/20 0:25 - Joe: Cause talking to strangers*
25/4/20 0:35 - Lorena: No digas eso!!!!!! Don't say that!!!
25/4/20 0:37 - Lorena: Hijo de p... Jajaja
25/4/20 0:38 - Lorena: I am less dangerous than the old couple! Haha 😇
25/4/20 0:39 - Joe: Hahaha alright maybe I’ll put the weed away but you’ll have to try harder to scare me off 🥱
25/4/20 0:41 - Lorena: It's true, I didn't scare you too much.  But what if they then look for you to sell you and are secret police?
25/4/20 0:44 - Lorena: if they put you in jail later I can't write to you! 🤹
25/4/20 0:46 - Lorena: I know that nothing can scare you tough guy, but be careful just in case, few things are free.  Although that looks good, enjoy itttt, I would do it hahah
25/4/20 0:49 - Joe: I buy from my family so they can’t catch me haha 🚔
25/4/20 0:49 - Joe: I’ll try my best to stay out of jail. I’ve done pretty good at that so far haha
25/4/20 0:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:09 - Joe: 😂
25/4/20 1:10 - Joe: I want to ask you, what do you usually like to do for fun? What keeps you entertained?
25/4/20 1:24 - Lorena: mmm, as you already know I really like nature, so among my plans is always to do routes with my dogs, with my friends we also try to spend time outside. I like to go to yoga or bikram classes..
25/4/20 1:25 - Lorena: Design is very present in my day to day, I look at projects, inspiration, when I can go to events and talks. I also really like to do DIY, I spent time working in a workshop and I loved it!
25/4/20 1:32 - Joe: Nice nice. I like that you’re creative and that you love the outdoors so much. That’s really cool. Yoga is ok, I took a class once, it was a little harder than I though it would be but I was enjoying it by the end of the class.
25/4/20 1:48 - Lorena: mirá te paso algunas fotos así es más dinámico jaja
25/4/20 1:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 1:56 - Joe: Haha you look like you’re fun to hang out with. Always with a drink near by 🍹
25/4/20 1:57 - Joe: Hahaha the dogs are posing so good 😂
25/4/20 1:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:01 - Lorena: to hang out, ha!
25/4/20 2:01 - Lorena: yes, a little bit forced.. behind the camera, food jjj
25/4/20 2:04 - Joe: Haha what!? Is that weird? I hope you know what I meant 😆
25/4/20 2:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:07 - Lorena: si jaja, en español es muy raro.. es como... negativo, pero te entendí
25/4/20 2:07 - Joe: So many dogs! I love dogs but I don’t have any. I used to when I was growing up though.
25/4/20 2:08 - Lorena: Sorry if I bored you with the photos, I had a good idea to combine text haha
25/4/20 2:09 - Joe: 🤔 what would I say then?
25/4/20 2:10 - Joe: I love the photos!
25/4/20 2:17 - Joe: I would send you some photos too but everything I have is just videos of me skateboarding or pictures of nature hahaha
25/4/20 2:20 - Lorena: try to find some photos or video, I would like to see 🙂
25/4/20 2:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:26 - Lorena: Jajaja con la escoba
25/4/20 2:26 - Lorena: Muy bueno! 😂
25/4/20 2:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:27 - Lorena: 😲😍😍😍😍
25/4/20 2:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 2:35 - Joe: I shouldn’t have sent that last one  😆 I didn’t pick the piñata 🤷🏽‍♂️

Ok that’s all I have. Unless you want skateboarding videos. But I think I’ve embarrassed myself enough for one day.
25/4/20 2:35 - Lorena: your piñata penis looks good on you! 🙊
25/4/20 2:37 - Lorena: you're just grabbing her for the eggs 🤟
25/4/20 2:37 - Joe: Hahahahahah
25/4/20 2:42 - Joe: I was working hard that day 😓 haha
25/4/20 2:44 - Lorena: I saw videos, you skate very well 🙌
25/4/20 2:44 - Lorena: If someday you want ... you can send me a photo or video from there 😉
25/4/20 2:45 - Lorena: 😂 muy muy duro!!!! Jaja
25/4/20 2:50 - Joe: Haha I’ll have to take more photos or videos just for you cause I don’t take them very often 😅 I’m camera shy
25/4/20 2:51 - Joe: Or just all around shy now that I think about it lol
25/4/20 9:37 - Lorena: 9:35 haha.  I fell asleep yesterday!
25/4/20 9:42 - Lorena: haha what an honor, perfect ... I hope those photos / videos!
25/4/20 9:46 - Joe: Buenos días!
25/4/20 9:46 - Joe: Yeah I figured you fell asleep. It was getting late there haha
25/4/20 9:46 - Lorena: a shy boy, he's cute.  I don't know many like that haha
25/4/20 9:50 - Joe: Hahah that’s funny. I don’t know why I’m like this 😅
25/4/20 9:51 - Joe: How’s it looking over there today? Another beautiful day in quarantine?
25/4/20 9:56 - Lorena: I guess at first, then when you meet someone, no.  Gastón is shy too, I the opposite haha ​​and We are brothers
25/4/20 10:00 - Lorena: mmm haha ​​I have no course today.  for now in bed still hahaha..mmm Netflix, reading, yoga or dancing, not much else haha ​​eat, sleep, and look out the window
25/4/20 10:01 - Joe: Well it’s a good thing you’re the opposite! You’re very outgoing and you seem to know what you like, even if it’s on the other side of the world hahaha
25/4/20 10:03 - Joe: Feel free to send video if you decide to dance 💃 😝
25/4/20 10:04 - Lorena: haha good perception and funny hahah
25/4/20 10:08 - Lorena: Nooo, jaja muy ridícula. Hago bailes raros, mientras ordeno o hago cosas. Aunque el otro día, bailé una danza africana de YouTube... al verme en el espejo sentía una mezcla entre felicidad, vergüenza y risa jajaja
25/4/20 10:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 10:12 - Joe: Hahahaha I would LOVE to see that someday!! 😂 😂 😂
25/4/20 10:13 - Joe: As long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters. I would find it very cute to see you laughing and dancing. I like that energy haha
25/4/20 10:17 - Lorena: hahaha shit, well I'll try one day I promise nothing ...
25/4/20 10:19 - Lorena: And what do you like to do?  besides skating that this is number 1 🔥
25/4/20 10:27 - Joe: Hmmm I like to program on my computer, I spend a lot of time learning about companies/business because I like to buy stocks haha, I like carnivorous plants like the one in my story from yesterday, outdoor stuff like swimming or hiking.

I also will get random hobbies now and then. Whatever I find fun and interesting in the moment, you know?
25/4/20 10:30 - Joe: I’m not the most exciting person I suppose 🤔 but hey, I am what I am 🤷‍♂️
25/4/20 10:48 - Joe: But yeah my most favorite thing to do is skating with my friends. 

If you get super bored today you can see my video part https://youtu.be/XzZcNds9KBo


Making these kind of videos is what my friends and I like to do
25/4/20 10:49 - Lorena: If I find it exciting, you chose a profession that you enjoy with it, you like plants, outdoor sports, not in a gym..
25/4/20 10:51 - Joe: Haha ok good
25/4/20 10:52 - Joe: Oh and I’m way at the end of that video haha. But it gives a vibe of what we’re like I think. It was so fun to make. We’re working on another one now.
25/4/20 10:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 10:54 - Lorena: Justo lo estaba mirando, va muy rápido y me cuesta reconocerte jaja pero estoy en ello 😂
25/4/20 10:55 - Joe: Hahahahaha shit!
25/4/20 10:57 - Lorena: min 2:10, jaja el viejo mirándote..buena demostración 😂
25/4/20 11:01 - Joe: Hahah muchas gracias! I should not have sent you that video lmao hopefully there isn’t anything else embarrassing in there I don’t remember. I don’t think there is much though haha. It’s super long. And you’ll probably notice when my part starts they put my name as Hone. That’s what my friends called me.
25/4/20 11:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 11:09 - Joe: Hahahaha 🐻
25/4/20 11:11 - Joe: Here is more of us being stupid on the internet. Might as well let you find anything embarrassing of me that’s out there now hahahaha 

https://instagram.com/benal_biddyhoes?igshid=lovet1vjxtsr
25/4/20 11:15 - Lorena: Ya lo ví! Esta genial el video, parece muy divertido! Vos sos mejor de todosss jaja por eso te dejaron para el final como en los espectáculos 😂
25/4/20 11:21 - Joe: Hahaha! ☺️ thank you thank you. I think I’ve sent you all the video on the internet of me doing weird stuff. Glad to get that out of the way 🤣
25/4/20 11:22 - Lorena: La toma del garage, vuelas alto jaja. No entiendo los trucos pero tienes mucho estilo! 🔥 Tu amigo de gafas es tu fan número 1 hahaha
25/4/20 11:26 - Lorena: haha I already follow Benal😈
25/4/20 11:28 - Joe: Thanks, style is important to skaters so that’s good you can notice haha🕺

i have to tell Vince that he is my number one fan hahahaha that’s hilarious. He is definitely my hype man!
25/4/20 11:41 - Lorena: Jaja sii mucho estilo Joe, me gusta! Jajajaja sii Vince es muy exagerado, pero muy gracioso! El vive mucho las situaciones cuando te sale un truco jajaja
25/4/20 11:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 11:50 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂 fuuuuck that is Vince hahaha thats my dude! He definitely makes things more exciting and fun. He just had his first kid recently though so he is taking it down a notch 😆
25/4/20 12:11 - Lorena: Jajaj pero que edad tiene Vince? Es joven no?
25/4/20 12:12 - Joe: I think I’m going to try that mystery weed from the old hippies. Wish me luck haha
25/4/20 12:14 - Joe: He’s 28. I definitely didn’t expect him to have a kid but he’s a cool dude and he’s doing a good job being a dad or whatever haha. His daughter is a super cool and happy little kid. I love to see that haha
25/4/20 12:14 - Lorena: Jajaja qué bueno, mucha suerte y buen viaje. Hacelo flojo
25/4/20 12:21 - Lorena: super young, surely he is a good father seems good people.  Do you like children?
25/4/20 12:24 - Joe: Yeah kids are great. That’s one reason I really enjoy my job at the skatepark. We do those summer camps and working with the kids is really fun. They can be little jerks sometimes hahaha but for the most part kids I like children. How about you?
25/4/20 12:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 12:30 - Lorena: Yes, I like them, it depends on which one.  I love babies, the big ones if they aren't spoiled and dumb I also like them.  I don't know why but I enjoy more with the boys haha
25/4/20 12:31 - Joe: It’s true! Some of them seem like they just want to make you mad 😡 they think it’s hilarious or they want attention. Their games don’t work on me though, by the end of the week I usually have them on my side haha.
25/4/20 12:33 - Lorena: 😂😂 Joe presidente!
25/4/20 12:36 - Lorena: I would like to see these situations, but surely you can "chop" them when they don't come up with a trick and you do 👹
25/4/20 12:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 12:38 - Joe: Their* place
25/4/20 12:40 - Joe: Dude, I did have one kid last summer that was sooooo difficult though and I just couldn’t get him to do anything! The worst part was that he was at camp more weeks than any other kid! He really pushed my buttons hahaha that little mother fucker
25/4/20 12:42 - Lorena: Hahahaha
25/4/20 12:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 12:46 - Lorena: Kid no es hijo
25/4/20 12:47 - Lorena: Buttons? 🤣 Me dice que son botones
25/4/20 12:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 12:49 - Joe: Hahahaha it’s a saying. Like he got on my nerves or he annoyed me on purpose
25/4/20 12:52 - Lorena: yes hahahaha, but I don't think they are buttons or what?  this expression in Spanish is " no me toques los huevos" (huevos =testicles)
25/4/20 12:52 - Joe: Hahah shit
25/4/20 12:55 - Joe: Hmmm that’s closer “don’t bust my balls”. Similar meaning though. “Don’t push my buttons”, I thought that was common haha
25/4/20 12:58 - Lorena: hahaha I can always learn something new.  I find that expression with the buttons strange and funny
25/4/20 13:00 - Lorena: I can also say" You really push my bottons"?
25/4/20 13:03 - Joe: Exactly. Hopefully I don’t push your buttons though hahaha at least not yet
25/4/20 13:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 13:04 - Joe: That gif is the children hahaha
25/4/20 13:05 - Lorena: Jajajaja es muy raro. Mi cabeza en cuarentena entiende otra cosa 🤭🤭
25/4/20 13:06 - Lorena: sorry, sorry.  it's very hard to be locked up hahah
25/4/20 13:07 - Joe: Hahahah that’s ok, don’t be sorry 😂
25/4/20 13:07 - Joe: Aaaahhhhh
25/4/20 13:07 - Joe: Hahahaha
25/4/20 13:08 - Joe: 🤭
25/4/20 13:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 13:29 - Lorena: Joe, recomiendame algo de música para escuchar ahora!
25/4/20 13:33 - Joe: Hahaha alright let me see...do you have a music app or I can send them from YouTube?
25/4/20 13:34 - Lorena: YouTube/ Spotify
25/4/20 13:36 - Joe: Hmm ok. What kind of mood do you want? 😆 

I hate sharing music cause I feel like I’m being judged but I’ll do it for you hahaha judge away👩‍⚖️
25/4/20 13:37 - Lorena: jajaja
25/4/20 13:38 - Lorena: Be careful, I judge a bit if I don't like the music that happens to me. Don't lose points, I'll try not to..
25/4/20 13:41 - Joe: I like the music they play out here on the island 🌴 and mostly mellow stuff but I like a lot of different stuff. Depends on my mood haha

https://youtu.be/ANy4jn4VuL0
25/4/20 13:41 - Joe: 🙈
25/4/20 13:42 - Joe: J. Boog

https://youtu.be/m9LobsW8mLk
25/4/20 13:43 - Joe: Haha this is going to be my song for the next skate video https://youtu.be/itZe1pgsxag

Oh god you’re going to hate me after I send you music. Shit
25/4/20 13:45 - Joe: https://youtu.be/-knXBsbZRJA

Just so you know I never send anyone music. I always make an excuse or tell them I just like everything haha  this feels very weird for me
25/4/20 13:46 - Joe: And it really depends on my mood because I could send you something super upbeat and danceable or some mopey sad boy shit Hahahaha. Please don’t judge me too much 🙏🏽 😊
25/4/20 13:46 - Lorena: chan chan chan!! mmm
25/4/20 13:48 - Lorena: I like this !! At first from the photo it seemed that no.. hahah  but it sounds good and I hadn't heard music like that
25/4/20 13:48 - Joe: Haha what??? Is that bad or good.
25/4/20 13:50 - Lorena: this yes, too! saved
25/4/20 13:51 - Joe: https://youtu.be/lmsbHGEB6UU
25/4/20 13:51 - Lorena: Great, good choice !!!! I want to see that video, a preview, or when it's finished!
25/4/20 13:55 - Lorena: hahaha I like this less....but thanks for sending me music, in the end you are going to make me feel special.
 (for passing me music 🤔😅)
25/4/20 13:56 - Joe: I think it’ll be coming out in February 2021 but I’ll make sure you get to see it somehow 😊
25/4/20 13:57 - Joe: Haha ok ok I’ve embarrassed myself enough for one night. I’m getting tired and making bad decisions like sending you music 😂 😂
25/4/20 13:57 - Lorena: haha I love it! Of course the music also depends on the mood. When I do the course, I listen to music in Spanish very happy, so as not to get depressed Hahaha
25/4/20 13:57 - Joe: I’ll have to get some embarrassing stuff out of you sometime
25/4/20 14:00 - Joe: Haha that’s a good idea. I try to play upbeat stuff when I’m working too
25/4/20 14:02 - Lorena: ey ey ey, no!! jaja soy sincera, las que me gustan te lo digo y las que no también. Las tres primeras siyy y ya me las he guardado en spotify! las dos ultimas menos. No me emocionan bastante las voces femeninas por norma general, excepto cantantes como Janis Joplin, Nina Simone, que esas me gustan mucho!
25/4/20 14:02 - Lorena: I let you sleep, I guess you will be tired!
25/4/20 14:03 - Lorena: siiii please!
25/4/20 14:04 - Joe: That’s good to know. I’m glad you got a few songs out of me that you like. 

Haha alright, Lorena. I’ll talk to you later, I’m going to bed. Enjoy your day. Un beso 😘
25/4/20 14:06 - Lorena: Thank you, but tell me Lore (more friendly) sleep well Joe!!! un beso!! 😴
25/4/20 18:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/4/20 19:05 - Lorena: Ohhhhh
25/4/20 19:07 - Lorena: Jajaja que lindoo
25/4/20 20:36 - Joe: Sorry, I had to go back to sleep for a little longer haha 😴 

He must really like my feet for some reason. He loves sticking his head in my shoe too. He’s a weird little guy.
25/4/20 20:54 - Lorena: haha I figured you'd be sleeping a little more. I woke up and I had your message, I was in a nap, which the neighbors woke me up, at 7 it was agreed that the whole city should go out to make noise with saucepans to protest the government, but I didn't expect it and I woke up scared and with bad mood, many pots sounding loud hahaha
25/4/20 20:55 - Lorena: cómo se llama el gatito? es muy cariñoso!!  es tuyo o de Angela?
25/4/20 21:02 - Joe: Hahahaha not the most enjoyable way to wake up 😂 

Is there any timeframe for when lockdown is over for you?
25/4/20 21:04 - Joe: His name is Oni and he is Ang’s cat. He loves to meow a little too much sometimes which can be annoying but he’s alright.
25/4/20 21:04 - Joe: He is like me though. Only super affectionate if he is comfortable with you. He runs away from strangers haha
25/4/20 21:27 - Lorena: Today, we cannot go out, only to the supermarket. If you go out or are accompanied, the police will fine you...very strong! Today the president said...apparently on May 2,  We can go out individually to do sports for 1 hour, or take a walk 2 meters away..
25/4/20 21:30 - Lorena: Yes, cats are annoying with that, like babies haha ..luckily the dogs in that sense are more pleasant
25/4/20 21:32 - Lorena: haha Oni is the love of your life, they are the same. 💚Although that of running away from strangers, you do not apply it ..hahaha
25/4/20 21:34 - Joe: Damn that sounds rough. I wonder how long until there are zero restrictions? This whole thing is so weird.
25/4/20 21:36 - Joe: Yeah dogs are the best. I want a dog again soon!
25/4/20 21:37 - Joe: Hahahaha I guess that’s true. Good thing I don’t run away from strangers or I wouldn’t be talking to you ☺️

Wouldn’t have got that free bud the other day from the hippies either lol
25/4/20 21:40 - Lorena: At first it seemed like a joke ... but we have been locked up for a long time, for me it isn't very hard, I appreciate being healthy and having goals. As for... the lies of the government, the manipulation of the media, the abuse of the police and the selfish society. They are all motherfuckers and they gross me out 🔥
25/4/20 21:44 - Lorena: I also really want to have one, but if I work or travel, I couldn't take care of it, then I am holding on a little longer. Did you ever have a dog in your house? I at home with my parents, always since I was little
25/4/20 21:46 - Joe: I like your attitude 🔥🔥
25/4/20 21:47 - Lorena: hahaha Joe, we strangers are looking for you, you are attractive to us!
25/4/20 21:48 - Joe: Yeah I’m waiting for the right time too. I need to settle in somewhere first. Wouldn’t be fair to the dog otherwise.

I had 2 dogs when I was little and i always loved having them around
25/4/20 21:50 - Joe: Hahaha oh noooo 🙈
25/4/20 21:52 - Lorena: totally agree! do you like any breed or "chucho" ( dog without breed)
25/4/20 21:54 - Lorena: 🤗 hahaha, que tal la marihuana? fue buena?
25/4/20 22:01 - Joe: Yeah I was impressed by the old people weed haha. Not bad! I always assume old people have bammer(bad weed)
25/4/20 22:04 - Joe: I guess I prefer “chucho”(we call a dog without a breed “mutt”). 

I used to like breeds but breeding dogs is kind of weird when you really think about it. Trying to get certain features even if it’s not good for the dog is sad to me 😞
25/4/20 22:07 - Lorena: they are the best, the most experienced.  haha imagine you in 20 more years 🤟
25/4/20 22:08 - Lorena: I Guess I prefer "chucho" 💘
25/4/20 22:16 - Joe: I mean, they’re the way nature made them, and that’s fine with me. 

Does that mean you prefer chucho? It’s ok to like dogs with breeds, they are just not for me haha
25/4/20 22:21 - Lorena: I love all dogs, some breeds seem great to me, like Kenya (weimar braco) super athletic, intelligent, affectionate.....but the chuchos are special, they are a mix, they have personality and they are usually in kennels. I don't like the business that is generated with breed dogs
25/4/20 22:29 - Joe: I feel similar about the business from dog breeding. I would never hold it against a dog for being a pure breed and would still love them but I couldn’t bring myself to seek out a pure bred dog when looking to get one if that means I’m helping those kind of businesses. 

My friend has a pure bred French bulldog and I have to admit that little thing is cute as fuck 😂 A little small though haha

Good to know we’re on similar page though haha
26/4/20 0:17 - Lorena: yeah, well that we think the same about many things, the truth, even that the bull dogs are too small haha 🤭
26/4/20 0:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 0:29 - Joe: 🤔 looks kind of flat. Is it a picture? Oh, or a book?
26/4/20 0:30 - Joe: Hahaha I really don’t know. What is it?
26/4/20 0:30 - Lorena: Jajaja última opción, one more
26/4/20 0:31 - Joe: A letter. Written with a feather pen like it’s the 1700s hahaha
26/4/20 0:34 - Lorena: hahaha good try, but no. Is hectographic paper
26/4/20 0:35 - Lorena: I bought it for entertainment and to try out what a tattoo would look like haha
26/4/20 0:37 - Joe: 😂 I never would’ve guessed that!
26/4/20 0:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 0:39 - Joe: Very cool though
26/4/20 0:40 - Joe: Hahahah you’ll get it down I’m sure.
You’re only seeing what some tattoos would look like? Not going to ink yourself up??
26/4/20 0:44 - Lorena: I'll try again tomorrow.  I like to go with things clear if I'm going to get a tattoo.  I wanted an eagle on the leg, so I check that it looks good in that area, size, etc
26/4/20 0:47 - Joe: Damn that’s a good idea. I just go to my cousin and tell him the idea and we figure out hahaha

He’s really good though so it’s not like I’m going to my cousins house or something. He works in a shop
26/4/20 0:48 - Joe: https://instagram.com/misterbouncer?igshid=1h4f5s7bmlbd
26/4/20 0:51 - Joe: I have been wanting to get another one lately but I can’t think of what to get 🤔
26/4/20 0:55 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
26/4/20 0:57 - Lorena: Tenés alguno ahora? Dónde te gustaría hacértelo?
26/4/20 1:00 - Lorena: haha if it's good, I was watching your ig.  He will always use that clearly, haha.  mine is (silly?/foolishness?) but this way I go more safely, I hate to doubt and waste the person's time
26/4/20 1:02 - Joe: Silly! But I don’t think it’s silly at all 🙃 that makes sense


I only have 4. Two on my right arm, one on my right shoulder, and a tiny B with a circle on my side that my friend did while we were drunk at his apartment hahaha that one is funny. It took him soooo long just to make the tiny B.
26/4/20 1:05 - Joe: I don’t really know exactly where I want the next one but I want one on my side wrapping around to the front a little, like the rib cage area I guess.  And more on my back would be nice. I take forever to think of something though
26/4/20 1:05 - Joe: Oh maybe the forearm too
26/4/20 1:06 - Lorena: I want to see them, show them to me. (Hahha tiny B 🤭🥴)
26/4/20 1:09 - Joe: Hahaha
26/4/20 1:10 - Joe: https://www.instagram.com/p/B2O2f2YFE38/?igshid=1cdv0qszheabt
26/4/20 1:10 - Lorena: On the side of the rib cage I like that place. Try the paper and so it takes less haha.  you can trace it from the internet and then try it, although later it has modifications
26/4/20 1:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:14 - Joe: Do you have tattoos? Send photos! Hahaha
26/4/20 1:14 - Lorena: haha it's like prison tattoos they have memories 🤭 tiny b is adorable
26/4/20 1:15 - Lorena: Haha good idea, sure you do some more skate
26/4/20 1:16 - Joe: 🤣 muchas gracias! At the end of the video of me getting the tattoo you can see us getting ready to play that dice game too hahaha. I love my friends 😆
26/4/20 1:18 - Lorena: it's fun, your roots ( tus raíces)
26/4/20 1:20 - Lorena: haha the famous dice game!
26/4/20 1:20 - Joe: Hahah infamous
26/4/20 1:21 - Joe: ¿Y qué hay de tus tatuajes? ¿Qué tienes?
26/4/20 1:28 - Lorena: Acabo de hacer una foto pero se ve un poco mal por la luz
26/4/20 1:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:31 - Joe: No worries! Plenty of time hahaha take some tomorrow or whenever you feel like it.
26/4/20 1:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:31 - Joe: Oh there it is never mind haha
26/4/20 1:32 - Joe: My friend used to love making these and would always try to get everyone to drink matte with him hahaha that’s a cool one
26/4/20 1:33 - Joe: Very cute
26/4/20 1:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 1:34 - Lorena: Si? Que amigo??
26/4/20 1:36 - Joe: Those are awesome and I love that they have meaning for you. 

The friend was someone I grew up skating with but I don’t see him much anymore. Interesting guy, he would always be making his own beer, wine, or cider and trying to get everyone drinking matte with him.
26/4/20 1:37 - Lorena: Gracias!! 😘
26/4/20 1:38 - Lorena: Ese chico parece interesante jajaja, si, si. De dónde es?
26/4/20 1:41 - Joe: Muy interesante 😂 

I think his parents are Irish or something like that. He’s Super white boy haha
26/4/20 1:42 - Joe: He has always lived in the US though
26/4/20 1:44 - Lorena: haha okey, super white is not sexy
26/4/20 1:45 - Lorena: Mmm y como tomaba mate? Jaja que gracioso . A vos te gustó? Es amargo!
26/4/20 1:50 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂
26/4/20 1:53 - Joe: It was good. I drink my coffee black so I kind of like bitter drinks haha. 

He had it in a cup just like your tattoo, straw and everything. He would drink it pretty often.
26/4/20 1:59 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
26/4/20 2:01 - Lorena: Mate es el recipiente, bombilla es lo que vos decís straw jaja pero es de aluminio y lo de dentro es la yerba 🍃
26/4/20 2:05 - Lorena: Joe!  I'm going to sleep, have a good afternoon. Un beso 😉
26/4/20 2:06 - Joe: His straw was aluminum hahaha. I guess he knew what he was doing all along 😂
26/4/20 2:06 - Joe: Ok, sleep well. Talk to you later. Un beso
26/4/20 2:07 - Lorena: 😘😘😘
26/4/20 17:57 - Joe: Aaaahh I’m awake 😓 I just can’t stay asleep haha


Dude, I finished part 1 of la casa de paper and that shit was wild 😂 that show is crazy but so good.
26/4/20 18:05 - Lorena: Good morning pretty boy and early riser!
26/4/20 18:06 - Lorena: Have you finished your first season yet?  good haha, tell me some new word!
26/4/20 18:08 - Joe: My new word is vergüenza because that’s what I feel every time I speak Spanish hahahah

I’m still practicing saying it 😂
26/4/20 18:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 18:12 - Lorena: Tenés que repetir esta frase
26/4/20 18:13 - Lorena: " Yo tengo vergüenza, pero no me importa, porque Lore me enseña"
26/4/20 18:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 18:16 - Joe: Hahahaha shit
26/4/20 18:17 - Joe: It sounds so nice when you say it. Alright alright I guess I’ll embarrass myself some more today. Why not? Haha
26/4/20 18:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 18:19 - Joe: Aaaaahhh so bad hahah
26/4/20 18:20 - Lorena: haha you're so sweet.  I'm also ashamed when I have to speak English...but I don't want you to be ashamed I want to teach you!!!
26/4/20 18:20 - Lorena: 👏👏👏💚💚💚
26/4/20 18:21 - Lorena: Genial! I love it!!
26/4/20 18:25 - Joe: 🙈🙈🙈
26/4/20 18:26 - Joe: As long as you can kind of understand what I’m saying, I’ll take that as a win haha
26/4/20 18:27 - Lorena: I understand you perfectly, very well Joe, really!  I love the first seconds haha
26/4/20 18:31 - Joe: Aaaahhh haha I was too nervous when I started the recording 😂
26/4/20 18:35 - Lorena: Me encanta!
26/4/20 18:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 18:39 - Joe: Hahahaha
26/4/20 18:41 - Joe: At least I’m getting practice. That’s good. I’ve practiced more this week than I have in years. I’m starting to pick it up. 

When I started watching that show I could barely catch any words but by the end of season 1 I can understand a lot more. Watching that show is a great way to pick up spanish hahaha
26/4/20 18:47 - Lorena: I'm so proud of you, and I have to admit that I am very happy to be part of this! ☺️
26/4/20 18:56 - Joe: Well, I really appreciate the lessons professor 👩‍🏫
26/4/20 19:47 - Lorena: Jjj, entonces contame que tal la primera temporada, personaje preferido, personaje odiado,etc ??
26/4/20 20:02 - Joe: It’s was insane! My hands were sweating sometimes hahaha

So far I really like most of the people doing the robbery. Except maybe Berlin. And my most hated character is that Arturo guy. He’s a piece of shit 😂 😂 

But the professor, Tokyo, Denver, and Nairobi are my favorites I think. Helsinki is funny too.
26/4/20 20:21 - Lorena: Jajaja te involucraste en la serie!
 Berlín es un hijo de puta, y "Arturito" otro hijo de puta pero tonto jaja es patético!  

Coincidimos en los personajes, me gustan los mismos, quizá cambio a Helsinki por Río jjj pero Denver, Nairobi y Tokio, mis preferidos!
26/4/20 20:32 - Joe: Oh yeah I forgot about Rio. He is good too. 

When the professor was about to kill the inspectors mom I was losing it hahahaha 

Plot twist around every corner 😂
26/4/20 20:46 - Lorena: You still have good scenes. I already saw all the seasons. The last one was recently...jujuju I'm holding on so I don't spoiler 🤭🤐
26/4/20 21:04 - Joe: I have a lot to watch before I catch up to you haha. Yeah, don’t spoil 🙉🙉

How was today for you? Another beautiful day in quarantine?
26/4/20 21:22 - Joe: Ooooh I almost forgot, I need a message of you speaking english. 


"I'm ashamed, but I don't care, because Joe teaches me" same message I sent you but in English 👂
26/4/20 21:23 - Lorena: because now in weekend it is longer, without hours I am a bit of a disaster jjj
26/4/20 21:24 - Lorena: jajaja no 😭
26/4/20 21:24 - Lorena: necesito que me lo digas, esa pronunciación no sé jaja
26/4/20 21:25 - Joe: Hahah it’s ok if you don’t want to. I understand. But I’m going to send a message of me saying it to you
26/4/20 21:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 21:25 - Joe: One more
26/4/20 21:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 21:26 - Lorena: Joe, I'm super happy! for a grade of the course of an exercise, a 10! haha that teacher is a very nerd and a bit demanding boy..
26/4/20 21:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 21:27 - Joe: Congratulations! 🍾🎊🎈🎉
26/4/20 21:27 - Lorena: JAJAJA aprendiste a usar gift bien!
26/4/20 21:28 - Joe: I love gifs hahaha but maybe I don’t use them as often as you 😂
26/4/20 21:29 - Joe: You’re the gif master
26/4/20 21:30 - Lorena: The course has two very fat parts of modeling, I hate it. haha there were always errors, the models are easily deformed. Now in this third block, we are accepting the texture of those objects that we have made
26/4/20 21:31 - Lorena: te lo voy a mostar!!!
26/4/20 21:31 - Joe: Yes! Show me!
26/4/20 21:32 - Joe: That’s sounds super complicated haha that’s so cool though
26/4/20 21:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 21:41 - Lorena: every time, you use more, ejem ejem.. hahaha
26/4/20 21:43 - Joe: That’s siiiiick!! How long does it take to model stuff like that? 

I’m jealous. I want to know how to do that now haha
26/4/20 21:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 21:50 - Lorena: and then it's to put that glass texture and render
26/4/20 21:54 - Lorena: mmm I couldn´t tell you exactly, I know that many hours, because I´m learning and the time is relative...I have to see the explanation videos, then practice, do tests, etc.
26/4/20 21:55 - Joe: Cooooool haha I’m definitely going to learn how to do that someday. Looks like you can make some interesting stuff if you get good. 

What do you want to use the skill for? For interior design?
26/4/20 21:56 - Joe: That makes sense. I’m the same when I’m learning something in programming
26/4/20 21:59 - Lorena: haha if it is very useful, I encourage you to do it! Yes, it is necessary for interior design, in a project you must deliver plans, documents in 2D (AutoCAD) and then in 3D (to see how it would look) there are several programs, but this is the most used..
26/4/20 22:00 - Lorena: Exactly, I want to see things about you too!
26/4/20 22:06 - Joe: Nice. Definitely send more of your work to me if you need someone to show off to haha I’m very interested in it!
26/4/20 22:10 - Joe: My stuff is boring hahah. The last thing I worked on was a website so I guess I can show you that. I only did a few parts of it though. The top section and “the team” section. 

Cronycreative.com

Before that I was working on automation scripts/code that would complete teachers work logging grades. Can’t really show that one but it basically just made the computer automatically transfer grades from one website to another
26/4/20 22:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 22:17 - Lorena: on the web, in the team part ... did you choose the design of the circles, typography, color, photos? sorry I don't know if I understood correctly
26/4/20 22:18 - Joe: No I don’t chose any design at all. I just build it to look like what the designer made.
26/4/20 22:18 - Joe: Hahahaha
26/4/20 22:19 - Joe: So if you need a website you can draw up what you want or make it using a program called Adobe XD and I can make it for you 👍
26/4/20 22:20 - Joe: But don’t ask me to design anything cause I’m terrible at that part hahaha
26/4/20 22:21 - Lorena: how is built? I have no idea, I'm really bad for this. haha
26/4/20 22:24 - Lorena: Good team, when I decide to make one, you will be the one to make it for me !!! so I have an excuse to see you too
26/4/20 22:30 - Joe: Good team for sure! Definitely hit me up when you need one. I’d be stoked to build one for you!
26/4/20 22:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 22:32 - Joe: Oh and I’d be even more stoked to see you 😂 😅☺️
26/4/20 22:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 22:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 22:40 - Lorena: omg, how many codes, there is a lot of work behind! you can work anywhere in the world, and everything related to business needs a website!! You just need a computer!
26/4/20 22:42 - Joe: That’s the plan! And yeah, there is a lot of code to make a website.

I was surprised by how much it took to make something simple when I first started learning.
26/4/20 22:42 - Lorena: Poco a poco... I get you to be more affectionate, hahaha
26/4/20 22:44 - Joe: Hahaha oh nooooo 😱
26/4/20 22:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/4/20 22:48 - Lorena: this is bad, right?
26/4/20 22:48 - Lorena: haha ok, what did you tell me about the page?
26/4/20 22:49 - Joe: I was just kidding
26/4/20 22:49 - Joe: 🤗
26/4/20 22:52 - Joe: I said that to make that simple webpage I need to open this program and its all just a bunch of words haha
26/4/20 22:53 - Joe: I said too much in the video hahah. But basically it takes all the code I showed in the program to make the website I was showing
26/4/20 22:57 - Lorena: yes yes, I have understood it and I have seen it clearer in the video 👌🏻
26/4/20 23:03 - Joe: Send music to me!
26/4/20 23:07 - Joe: It’s my turn to judge you haha👨‍⚖️
27/4/20 18:57 - Lorena: Buenos díasss ✨!
27/4/20 19:16 - Joe: Buenas noches 🌙
27/4/20 19:22 - Lorena: here it is 7:20 pm, it's still early jj
27/4/20 19:31 - Joe: Buenas tardes(?) haha

Only a few more days until you’re allowed outside. You must be looking forward to that.
27/4/20 19:32 - Lorena: Buenas tardes, si! Jjj
27/4/20 19:33 - Lorena: Aunque no se dice mucho, es más formal. Se dice buenos días, buenas noches, y por la tarde, hola, simplemente jaja
27/4/20 19:35 - Lorena: Yes, I really want to go out, I really want to go to the beach!  At times I get tired of not having contact with other people or with nature...even something like going to the cinema or a theater
27/4/20 19:41 - Lorena: Hahha uuhh, que música querés escuchar?
27/4/20 19:41 - Joe: I feel it. Your lockdown sounds extreme. I’m good with not being around people and doing my own thing but it’s nice to mix it up. 

What’s the first thing you’re going to do?
27/4/20 19:43 - Joe: Whatever you like haha I’m not super picky with music and I probably won’t actually judge you so send anything 🤙
27/4/20 19:46 - Lorena: haha we have been locked up for 40 days, luckily I was fine all this time, well now I am too..but I want to return to normal life. There are bad forecasts. For example.. restaurants will have dividing screens.  You will have to go out wearing a mask, summer is coming soon and there will be no festivals, and the beach will be controlled..
27/4/20 19:50 - Lorena: the first?  mmmm don't come back to my house all day haha. I will go see my family, I will take a long walk with my dogs, I will see my friends, we will have a few beers and we will smoke a joint in the river ☺️
27/4/20 19:54 - Joe: Damn that’s rough. I wonder when it goes back to normal completely
27/4/20 19:55 - Lorena: I like everything, except electronic, pop, commercial ... I go by times, lately I listen to these songs..
27/4/20 19:55 - Joe: That sounds super chill. At least you have something to look forward to for now.
27/4/20 19:55 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsoiupLME-w
27/4/20 19:56 - Lorena: this reggae version of the pink floyd song, I loveeeee it!
27/4/20 19:58 - Lorena: Siiiii Joe, ojalá llegue pronto el momento!!! 🙏🏻
27/4/20 20:01 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mps6wvzxP2c
27/4/20 20:06 - Lorena: haha the group that I listen to in loop, the criminals (Los Delincuentes ) hahah It is a Spanish group, from the south, here they are famous ... from years ago. his super happy music and his hearty songs! 
the song belongs to Delincuentes, but many famous musicians appear in this video. their look is rare, but it is typical here jaja informal.
27/4/20 20:09 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufS9fROh6Z4
27/4/20 20:09 - Joe: I like this one haha very cool
27/4/20 20:10 - Lorena: these also in Spanish, Argentinos In Uruguay, you hear a lot, mixing with South American rock and reggae
27/4/20 20:12 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DLEF2faqY
27/4/20 20:12 - Joe: Pretty cool how everyone looks so “low key”(informal) in those last two
27/4/20 20:13 - Lorena: I listen to this a lot too, it brings me good energy haha ​​completely different from the rest
27/4/20 20:13 - Joe: Haha good choice
27/4/20 20:14 - Lorena: I listen to everything, what I like the most is rock, reagge, in English and Spanish, jazz too
27/4/20 20:17 - Joe: That’s a good mix. I listen to a pretty wide variety of stuff too. Sometimes I’ll like a song I would usually never like just because it was in a skate video haha so that leads to me liking some weird shit sometimes.
But if it reminds me of the persons skate part and gets me hyped I like it 🤷‍♂️
27/4/20 20:23 - Lorena: Thank you, I passed you a rare mixture, but well haha ​​I hope not to be judged negatively!🙈
27/4/20 20:27 - Lorena: Sure, each song reminds you of skate videos. haha that's great. When you discover new music that you like, send it to me. When I'm listening to my playlist, the hawaii song comes out hahah
27/4/20 20:33 - Joe: Haha I’m not judging you. I like your music but even if I didn’t I wouldn’t judge you for it
27/4/20 20:34 - Joe: Sure, I’ll keep you in mind when I hear new songs I like haha. The Hawaiian jams are so good. I love the vibe.
27/4/20 20:37 - Lorena: 👏🙌
27/4/20 20:40 - Lorena: Debe ser genial, cultura de playa, suena como todo super alegre!
27/4/20 20:41 - Lorena: Y que tal el único de tu día? Estás patinando ya o tomando café en el jardín? Haha
27/4/20 20:46 - Joe: Today I’ve been lazy. I’m still sitting in bed with Oni 😂 

I finished my recent job last week so I don’t have much to do until I get my next job. Freelance life or whatever haha
27/4/20 20:52 - Joe: I’m about to get up and make some breakfast though then send some proposals for that next gig.
27/4/20 20:54 - Lorena: haha what a good life Joe! When "I grow up" I want to be like you hahah
27/4/20 20:55 - Lorena: I want a photo of you with Oni, please!haha
27/4/20 20:59 - Joe: Hahahaha you don’t want to be like me! 😂 😂
27/4/20 21:00 - Joe: Aw man he’s outside already. I’m in the kitchen about to make these pancakes 🥞 😂 


I’ll send you one later when he’s around
27/4/20 21:01 - Lorena: Jajajaja
27/4/20 21:02 - Lorena: Bueno, entonces sin Oni jajaja Tuya con los pancakes!
27/4/20 21:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/4/20 21:10 - Joe: Hahaha I’m a fuckin mess right now but alright
27/4/20 21:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/4/20 21:12 - Joe: I literally got out of bed and went to the kitchen so don’t judge my messy appearance too much please hahahah
27/4/20 21:12 - Joe: And somehow I got pancake mix on my arm in that picture 😂
27/4/20 21:14 - Lorena: I like your appearance!  I like to see people's faces when they wake up, I find their eyes funny.
27/4/20 21:14 - Lorena: Jajajajaja muy gracioso!
27/4/20 21:16 - Lorena: I'd eat a pancake now even if it's almost night!  haha
27/4/20 21:20 - Joe: Breakfast foods might just be my favorite food so I could it pancakes whenever
27/4/20 21:30 - Lorena: Jaja sí?? Con que los acompañas? Fruta, chocolate?
27/4/20 21:42 - Joe: Well it would’ve been some fruit but we’re all out 🙅‍♂️ 

So only plain pancakes for me today 😞 

I need to go to the supermarket and restock.
27/4/20 22:16 - Lorena: jajaja Joe, el maestro de los pancakes!!
27/4/20 22:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/4/20 22:54 - Joe: Well what do you like to eat? Are you a vegetarian or something like that? 
Not a big deal but I eat a lot of meat haha
27/4/20 23:28 - Lorena: Omg I'm  tired, fumé un porro y bailé como una hora
27/4/20 23:30 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
27/4/20 23:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/4/20 23:33 - Lorena: Tu música
27/4/20 23:35 - Joe: Haha super cute 😆 definitely don’t have to be embarrassed about that hahaha
27/4/20 23:36 - Joe: That is a long time to be dancing at home though hahaha. Must be good 🍃 😂
27/4/20 23:44 - Joe: You should definitely send more videos of you dancing 💃 Especially in your pajama haha 

Thanks very much for the video 😂
27/4/20 23:49 - Lorena: haha I am a little spontaneous and impulsive 🙈 and at times I forget that you are a stranger haha
27/4/20 23:51 - Joe: All good. A lot of the people around here walk around town with less clothes on than that hahaha your pjs are cute that’s all 🤷‍♂️
27/4/20 23:54 - Lorena: Jajaja gracias
27/4/20 23:57 - Lorena: Ahora te tocará bailar para mi en un vídeo jajajaj
28/4/20 0:01 - Lorena: Estamos en primavera pero en esta casa hace mucho calor, todo el mundo en pijama jaja hay muchos "memes" de eso
28/4/20 0:03 - Joe: Hahahaha noooooo aaahhhh maybe later for the dancing video 🕺
28/4/20 0:05 - Joe: Oh ok. How hot is it out there? 

It’s 70-85F here pretty much everyday.
28/4/20 0:06 - Lorena: Jajajaja siiiii 👏👏🙌🙌
28/4/20 0:06 - Lorena: Me gusta que no tengas vergüenza para las cosas que te pido, muy divertido jajaja
28/4/20 0:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 0:09 - Joe: Might as well have no shame when you’re asking me to embarrass myself haha. I owe you a video but I’m not promising when you’ll get it lol
28/4/20 0:10 - Lorena: Muchísimo calor 🤯
28/4/20 0:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 0:11 - Joe: Oh yeah. I feel like I haven’t put a shirt on in weeks hahaha 

Just shorts all day everyday
28/4/20 1:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 1:03 - Lorena: luckily you have a beach nearby!
28/4/20 1:12 - Lorena: Ah, antes me preguntabas por la comida. No soy vegetariana, aunque me gustaría en algún momento serlo o hacerlo de manera más responsable ya que me encantan los animales. Pero en Uruguay la cultura de la carne es muy social también y a mí me encanta. Disfruto en realidad con toda la comida , carnes, verduras, frutas, dulces,comida basura/comida rápida, todo es rico jajaja!
28/4/20 1:27 - Joe: Yeah I love being near the beach in this hot weather. It’s a life saver haha. 

I hear you on eating more responsible/sustainable. Would be nice to give it a try. If anything just cut back slightly on the amount of animal product and when I do eat animals try to get stuff that is raised better than the big commercial farm animals.
28/4/20 1:35 - Joe: Ooooh I’m so excited I might get my infamous dice game working today hahaha. It’s still super ugly cause like I said I’m terrible at design but if it works that’s all that matters to me. 

Although, I might at least make the dice look like actual dice eventually. That’s a lot of work for a dumb game for me and my friends though 😆
28/4/20 1:41 - Lorena: totally agree!
28/4/20 1:45 - Lorena: Siiii???? Today is the first day that you are going to use it?  how is the game exactly?  I want to see a preview!  Good Joe, ánimo con eso!
28/4/20 1:49 - Joe: Yeah I just need to get one more thing working. The game needs to sign out users automatically when they close the game so I’m working on that. 


The game is called 3s. You roll dice and have to pick up at least one die after every roll. If you pick up a 3 it counts as 0 but all other die give you the value that you rolled when you pick it up. 


The goal is to get the lowest score by the end
28/4/20 1:49 - Joe: Your turn is over after you pick up all the dice
28/4/20 1:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:00 - Joe: I’ll actually make it look nice and animate some dice if I get bored I guess but I didn’t see the need to impress my friends 😂
28/4/20 2:02 - Lorena: haha ohh the emotion presenting your game. you have to select the lowest values ​​and the game automatically makes the sum. So it's luck, right?
28/4/20 2:03 - Joe: Exactly!
28/4/20 2:03 - Lorena: I like the style, haha ​​it's like vintage.
28/4/20 2:07 - Joe: Hahah vintage. Yeah I’ll go with that description hahahaha
28/4/20 2:07 - Lorena: I want to see the codes hahaha as they are so that the squares of the dice appear for example
28/4/20 2:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:10 - Lorena: Jijjijiji 🤠
28/4/20 2:12 - Lorena: Un consejo: la puntuación final a lo mejor quedaría bien como más grande
28/4/20 2:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:14 - Lorena: Uouo jaaja voy a ver!!!
28/4/20 2:14 - Joe: Dude give me all the design tips hahaha


Here you can look at it and try it out but it still has bugs and won’t log you out when you’re done but I’ll reset the server after so don’t judge harshly 👍 


Enigmatic-stream-22705.herokuapp.com
28/4/20 2:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:18 - Joe: Hahahahaha probably just a bunch of gibberish to you but I appreciate you being interested 😂
28/4/20 2:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:20 - Joe: Haha so high!
28/4/20 2:21 - Joe: yeaaaaah that’s the bug haha. I’ll send the link when it’s all the way working.
28/4/20 2:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:22 - Lorena: Click
28/4/20 2:22 - Lorena: Click
28/4/20 2:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:23 - Lorena: Hahaha mañana jugamos cuando lo tengas
28/4/20 2:24 - Joe: Hahahaha it’s broken! I know I know I’m sorry. I’ll get it working for real soon. At least you got to test it once. You can give me design tips and put web designer on your résumé 😂
28/4/20 2:24 - Lorena: Mañana con tus amigos y el jueves conmigo jajaj
28/4/20 2:25 - Joe: Hahaha ok sounds good. We’ll definitely play together. I should make a chat feature next. It never ends 👨‍💻
28/4/20 2:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:27 - Lorena: just kidding, I just want to cheer you up! Jjjj
28/4/20 2:27 - Lorena: Tips design?
28/4/20 2:28 - Lorena: Mmmm la puntuación final en grande y con sonido?  Okey o solo grande? Jaja
28/4/20 2:28 - Joe: Haha no worries I’m super stoked. I stopped working on the game for a few days cause I was frustrated I couldn’t get it working. Getting past this step was a big hurdle so I’m happy.
28/4/20 2:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 2:29 - Joe: Hahaha I guess it could use more of a victory dance type of feel after the win
28/4/20 2:30 - Lorena: Of course, you have to continue with it.  sometimes it is better to stop a few hours or days, then you will perform better
28/4/20 2:30 - Joe: Sound would be interesting just because I’ve never had to add sound to a site. Would probably be pretty simple 🤔
28/4/20 2:31 - Joe: I think that was it. I just needed a break. The solution in the end wasn’t even very difficult to fix but finding where the problem was in the first place was killing me. Had a eureka moment this morning while watching some coding seminar thing on YouTube haha
28/4/20 2:32 - Lorena: the final size and sound can be more motivating for the player.  Sorry, I don't play anything, I think little desire to ignorance!
28/4/20 2:33 - Lorena: 🔊🔥
28/4/20 2:35 - Joe: If official...Lore the web designer 👩‍🎨
28/4/20 2:35 - Lorena: You aren't in a hurry either, mark the objectives that you would like to achieve.  You can also try it with your friends and they will give you an opinion!
28/4/20 2:36 - Lorena: Jajaja 🙈
28/4/20 2:40 - Joe: That’s solid advice. I could really use a checklist or something when I do stuff like this. I usually just start coding without much of a plan beforehand and it gets me into trouble all the time hahaha
28/4/20 2:45 - Lorena: any code you need I help you fix the problem, just ask me 👩‍💻😏
28/4/20 2:48 - Lorena: haha ánimo!!! 💪 surely you will learn new things and have a good time with your friends! 
 I'm going to sleep we'll talk tomorrow. Un beso, buenas noches!! 😘
28/4/20 2:50 - Joe: Muchas gracias!! Buenas noches! Un beso 😘
28/4/20 20:03 - Joe: Hola! Hope you had a good day! I’m just about to get mine started haha. 

This 12 hour time difference is weird 😂
28/4/20 20:21 - Lorena: Buenos días! Jaja sí, es rara. Estoy acostumbrada. Uruguay con España 5 horas, Costa Rica con España 8 horas y Hawaii con España 12, es lo máximo jajaja
28/4/20 20:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 20:26 - Lorena: Do you have pancakes today?
28/4/20 20:29 - Joe: Mmmm that looks good. No I had eggs and toast today haha

How’d your two exercises go? Is it getting harder as the class goes on?
28/4/20 20:31 - Joe: I’m only used to 3 hour difference between Hawaii and California haha
28/4/20 20:56 - Lorena: Hmm, this part gets more fun. materials, more realistic images remain. Before, I was modeling, and things get deformed easily. I was hysterical haha
28/4/20 20:57 - Lorena: In these We go faster, I am motivated to insist Sandra to continue, with a beer haha
28/4/20 21:01 - Lorena: very few...with me it is beastly! haha
28/4/20 21:03 - Lorena: and what are you doing in the house are you alone or does Angela work? Does anyone else live?
28/4/20 21:13 - Joe: Glad it’s getting more fun. Now you can start making the cool shit haha. 

Beer is a great motivator 😂
28/4/20 21:15 - Joe: Usually my sister works in town at the Pearl Factory but town is shut down so she is home for now. 


They extended our quarantine to the end of May, though they’re relaxing the rules a bit more soon.
28/4/20 21:16 - Joe: It’s just me and my sister here but my cousins and other family are super close by. Within walking distance. 

How about you? Is it just you and your roommate in Madrid? Do you have family near you?
28/4/20 21:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 21:29 - Lorena: Yes, although lately I am upset I have bought a new one. and the can is heavier than normal ... so I think there is more beer left, and the can is empty. putos ratas!!
28/4/20 21:30 - Lorena: cool shit jajaja
28/4/20 21:31 - Joe: Hahahaha that probably translates weird. Whoops 😂
28/4/20 21:31 - Lorena: Oniiiii, jaja que bonito es!!!!
28/4/20 21:32 - Lorena: which? hahaha cool shit no?
28/4/20 21:33 - Joe: Yeah. Cool shit 😎 💩
28/4/20 21:35 - Lorena: Oni loves you, sleeps with you too? or is he just going to say good morning?
28/4/20 21:36 - Lorena: It sounds weird, but I got it!! the description is perfect for 3ds Max hahah
28/4/20 21:38 - Lorena: Ohhhh, quarantine times there too! But the police don't tell you anything about going to the beach, right? We believe that in mid-May, We will be able to go outside!
28/4/20 21:41 - Joe: He just wants attention haha. He does like to sleep with me in my bed too. 


They’re fine with you being out but you can’t sit at the beach on a towel or chair. I usually look like I’m on the move when I’m outside so they think I’m just exercising. 

I saw the police taking to two old white ladies that were sitting at a bench near a beach. They were saying they couldn’t be there, while all these other people were getting ready to go out in the water surfing haha
28/4/20 21:42 - Joe: Police talking to* not taking haha
28/4/20 21:42 - Lorena: Mucha familia en Hawaii!  eso es genial..! yo vivo en un piso compartido, somos 3, pero cada una tiene su habitación. (flatmate no?) vivo con Sandra ( ella es compañera del trabajo, pero nos hicimos super amigas y buscamos una casa juntas),la otra chica con la que vivimos, se llama Nuria, ella ya vivia en esta casa, tiene 44 años y esta muyyyyy loca, de verdad!
28/4/20 21:49 - Joe: Haha I feel like people having a crazy older flatmate is super common for some reason. 

I know a lot of people that have one of those 😂 

Sounds like a nice setup though, especially having someone you’re friends with there with you.
28/4/20 21:50 - Lorena: Oni, in the end he goes to california!!!  Do you like sunbathing on the beach?
28/4/20 21:51 - Lorena: Could you send me a video skating down the road on the way to the beach, it would be the closest thing to vacation right now for me hahaha
28/4/20 21:52 - Joe: I wish! My sister wouldn’t like that 😂 

Sunbathing is ok but i like to play in the water or build stupid stuff in the sand. More fun that way haha
28/4/20 21:53 - Lorena: Of course, for older people it is much more dangerous, it is deadly! old white ladies? hahah what do you mean?
28/4/20 21:58 - Joe: I mean they were old and white and most likely not from around here.

It was only noticeable because they’re were sat on the bench near a bunch of super brown Hawaiian dudes that were getting ready to surf.
28/4/20 21:59 - Lorena: haha yesss, although age isn't important. the important thing is how unbalanced it is... It seems normal, but it is not. He says he is an athlete, and not a day has gone by since we came to live here. haha and she is also very envious, she can't stand that sandra and I get along so well..
28/4/20 21:59 - Lorena: build stupid stuff in the sand hahaha like a little boy.. ohh jajaja
28/4/20 22:00 - Joe: 🤗
28/4/20 22:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 22:02 - Lorena: hahaha good mix!
28/4/20 22:02 - Joe: I was just getting ready to go skate soon. I’ll send a video 👍
28/4/20 22:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 22:05 - Lorena: hahaha I can believe it! sos un personaje ( expresión en español para una persona, que es rara pero graciosa)
28/4/20 22:07 - Lorena: hahaha I imagine the situation, walking on the beach and seeing a boy so concentrated making his chair with footrests 😂  It's your family o were you alone?
28/4/20 22:09 - Joe: I was with some family. 

That’s my aunt, cousin(laying down), mom, sister, and my sisters friend.
28/4/20 22:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 22:34 - Joe: Haha thanks?

28/4/20 22:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 22:52 - Lorena: It is beautiful Hawaii, and super virgin that area, there is nobody! thanks for the videos, I like it like this, the tour, I can imagine it!
28/4/20 22:53 - Lorena: Are you complaining about the rocks? Hahaha
28/4/20 22:54 - Lorena: lindo!!!
28/4/20 22:56 - Lorena: haha buuuubu nooo, I like to see you in paradise!
28/4/20 23:00 - Joe: Haha there is lots of people but all my favorite places are where they don’t like to go 😂 


The nice beach probably has a lot of people. At least it did over the weekend.
28/4/20 23:00 - Joe: Noooo just saying I have to walk over the lava and sorry it’s shaky haha
28/4/20 23:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 23:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 23:43 - Lorena: Ya estoy en mi habitación, estaba cenando con Sandra 🍽️
28/4/20 23:44 - Lorena: You're going to kill me
28/4/20 23:46 - Joe: Haha why do you say that I’m going to kill you?
28/4/20 23:46 - Joe: Nunca
28/4/20 23:46 - Lorena: Esos lugares son increíbles, son demasiado lindos!!!!
28/4/20 23:48 - Lorena: Me gusta ver los vídeos con el sonido de las ruedas del patín, jaja libre
28/4/20 23:48 - Joe: Oh cause the places are too cute? Haha just come and visit  🙃
28/4/20 23:49 - Lorena: Jaja sí es una expresión en español," me vas a matar!!!"
28/4/20 23:49 - Lorena: Por ejemplo cuando algo es demasiado lindo, y puede darme envidia jaja
28/4/20 23:50 - Lorena: 😍😍😍😍😍
28/4/20 23:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 23:52 - Joe: Hahah ok. Cause in English that exact saying usually comes before admitting to something bad.

Like “You’re going to kill me....I crashed your car”
28/4/20 23:53 - Lorena: Jajaj también se usa así en español!  Negativo y positivo
28/4/20 23:54 - Joe: Hahah oooh ok. I never really here it used positively in English but I guess it could be.


What was for dinner?? 🍽
28/4/20 23:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/4/20 23:56 - Lorena: a crepe with ham and cheese and a beer.  hahaha simple
28/4/20 23:56 - Lorena: Jajaa
28/4/20 23:57 - Lorena: 🤷🤷🤷
29/4/20 0:00 - Lorena: Que tal en la playa???
29/4/20 0:03 - Joe: Sounds like a tasty dinner hah

Beaches were nice but it was starting to get cloudy like it might rain. 

I’m back home now. I skated through town and back. Everything is so close it, it doesn’t take much time to see everything.
29/4/20 0:05 - Joe: Oh and thank you for showing me that bug in my game. I fixed it 👍 

I probably never would’ve noticed it haha
29/4/20 0:09 - Lorena: It seems that you are alone in town! The end of the world !
29/4/20 0:10 - Lorena: Mmm 🤔?
29/4/20 0:11 - Joe: Click click
29/4/20 0:11 - Joe: I fixed it
29/4/20 0:12 - Joe: When you tried my game you went back and the screen went black
29/4/20 0:12 - Lorena: Ah hahha lo probaste con tus amigos al final?
29/4/20 0:13 - Joe: Yes! And my brother haha. Still more things to fix but we at least got to play a few rounds
29/4/20 0:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:14 - Joe: Hahaha is that mr bean? Cause it looks like mr bean
29/4/20 0:15 - Lorena: I always liked it, even when I was older.  I laugh a lot hahaha
29/4/20 0:16 - Joe: Yeah Mr. Bean is hella funny. I should watch some of his stuff today haha
29/4/20 0:17 - Joe: We’ll have to play each other in my game soon 👨‍💻👩‍💻
29/4/20 0:20 - Joe: Oh I don’t know if “hella” translates? It’s like “mucho” but you probably got that. 


I say hella, hella often haha
29/4/20 0:21 - Joe: What is some spanish slang you say a lot that probably won’t translate well??
29/4/20 0:22 - Lorena: Hahah
29/4/20 0:23 - Lorena: Muy o mucho
29/4/20 0:23 - Lorena: Muy divertido
29/4/20 0:24 - Lorena: Siiiii! Lo probamos mañana si querés! Dice dice yihaaa
29/4/20 0:25 - Lorena: Yo digo mucho, boluda/boludo. Demasiado. Jaja. En Uruguay y Argentina es típico decir así a una persona. En negativo y en positivo
29/4/20 0:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:32 - Lorena: Boludo/ boluda is like a dumb ( negative)
29/4/20 0:34 - Joe: Hahaha ok ok I understand that. I wouldn’t use it myself cause I’d be afraid to use it at the wrong time haha but I kind of get it
29/4/20 0:34 - Lorena: Or affectionate, positive ...
29/4/20 0:35 - Joe: Alright, tomorrow, you and me haha
29/4/20 0:36 - Lorena: Haha you can use It, I tell you if It's ok or not
29/4/20 0:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:44 - Lorena: 😱😱😱😱
29/4/20 0:44 - Joe: Told you I like bud a little more than beer 😂 

Beer is cool too though but much harder for me to code if I drink 🍹
29/4/20 0:45 - Lorena: Jajajaja Joe!
29/4/20 0:45 - Lorena: "La puta madre"
29/4/20 0:45 - Lorena: Otra expresión que digo mucho jaja cómo omg pero mal

29/4/20 0:47 - Lorena: Haha no no!!!! No te juzgo, pero es muchísimo! Jajaj cuanto tiempo te dura eso? Cuánto dinero es?
29/4/20 0:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 0:48 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
29/4/20 0:48 - Lorena: Ay me estoy riendo mucho
29/4/20 0:49 - Joe: Haha I’m good at gifs sometimes. 

It’ll probably last longer than a month. I’ll be back in California before I finish this. I’ll have to give some to my cousin and my sister haha. It was $160
29/4/20 0:50 - Lorena: Okay okay, The couple if old hippies didn't give you..did you them right? 🤔😅
29/4/20 0:51 - Lorena: Ah volvés al final a Cali? En junio, hay campamento de skate? Cuánto fumas por día? Toda la familia fuma jaja
29/4/20 0:52 - Joe: No nooo not the old couple haha. My sister has a friend to get it.
29/4/20 0:53 - Lorena: I know, It was a joke..puta barrera de idioma 🥴
29/4/20 0:54 - Joe: Mmm it depends. Sometimes I don’t smoke. But in quarantine I’ve been smoking a lot more haha. Too much time to chill with the other smokers 😂
29/4/20 0:54 - Lorena: Sos bueno con los gifs. Hay gente que me envía y son muy malos,jaja y tengo que reír obligada como.. ja! Ja!
29/4/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha yeah it sucks sometimes but I still have fun talking to you

At least gifs work for jokes haha. Gif....the universal language
29/4/20 0:56 - Lorena: tell me.  haha how much for day. In California?  and how much in Hawaii?
29/4/20 0:58 - Lorena: haha yes gif and smile universal language!
29/4/20 1:02 - Joe: Hahahaha I don’t take notes of it but I will smoke pretty often 😂 

I guess if one ounce last me one month the math works out to about 1 gram per day
29/4/20 1:04 - Joe: That’s out here in Hawaii. I guess in California it’s a lot less cause I work a lot when I’m out there
29/4/20 1:06 - Lorena: Jaja aquí se calcula por número
29/4/20 1:06 - Lorena: Ahí se mezcla con tabaco?
29/4/20 1:09 - Joe: No I don’t like mixing with tabaco really. 

Oh and I smoke from a bong often while I’m here so that’s why I can’t exactly say I smoke 1 joint or something if that’s what you mean.
29/4/20 1:11 - Joe: I can feel you judging me from halfway around the world 🙊🙉🙈
29/4/20 1:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:12 - Lorena: I'm Tom
29/4/20 1:13 - Lorena: Jajaj nooo, es broma! No te juzgo para nada!! Si no te afecta a mal, genial! Además cuando estás trabajando no fumas, es en tiempo libre
29/4/20 1:14 - Joe: Hahahaha 😂 shit
29/4/20 1:15 - Lorena: Yo fumo menos, muy eventual, por momentos más, por ejemplo en verano o cuarentena jajaja. Ya lo sabes, yo soy más de cerveza. Para comer y para cenar 🤷 Don't judge me jaja 👨🏻‍⚖️
29/4/20 1:15 - Joe: Ok ok for sure. That’s true.
29/4/20 1:16 - Lorena: No sé si hacemos buena pareja ..el fumado y la borracha 😂
29/4/20 1:16 - Joe: Not judging at all! You do you hahaha
29/4/20 1:17 - Joe: Nah it would be perfect 😂
29/4/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:18 - Lorena: Jajajajaja

29/4/20 1:27 - Lorena: Jajaja si, sería divertido. Con los osos y las cervezas
29/4/20 1:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:28 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
29/4/20 1:29 - Lorena: You are hella good using gifs
29/4/20 1:29 - Lorena: Jajaja ahora quiero usar hella para todo , creo que no sirve no? Jajaja
29/4/20 1:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:33 - Joe: Hahaha I use hella all the time. It’s slang but hella common in California. You’re good at using hella 😂
29/4/20 1:34 - Joe: Hahaha the quarantine kick off party
29/4/20 1:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 1:40 - Lorena: Sandra!!!
29/4/20 1:40 - Joe: Hahaha
29/4/20 1:40 - Joe: 😂 hola, Sandra!

Made me laugh haha very cute
29/4/20 1:49 - Lorena: Hahaha 🤭🤗
29/4/20 1:53 - Lorena: I'm going to sleep, quarantine partneeer from a distance! ✌️ Tomorrow you will have a word in Spanish!
29/4/20 1:54 - Joe: Haha alright, Lore. Talk to you later. Buenas noches!
29/4/20 22:18 - Joe: Hola! Super late start for me for once.

I didn’t want to get up today 🤷‍♂️
29/4/20 22:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 22:28 - Lorena: Hella late for you!
29/4/20 22:29 - Lorena: Te acostaste muy tarde?
29/4/20 22:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 22:41 - Lorena: Uooo, jugando a los dados? Jajaja
29/4/20 22:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 22:50 - Joe: 😂 😂 

I should’ve done that instead! I was working on another project and watching YouTube. Today I’m going to try to make my game a little less ugly
29/4/20 22:52 - Lorena: Mini Joe 😂
29/4/20 22:53 - Lorena: Hahaha how?
29/4/20 22:56 - Joe: I don’t even know yet 😂 

I’m sure it can look better somehow so I’m going to just experiment with it. Try random stuff and see what I like. If anything it’ll be good practice.
29/4/20 22:59 - Lorena: Of course, haha, I'm curious about the things that can be done. Could you for example move the dice? or even a simulation, remember messenger, the buzz?
29/4/20 23:03 - Joe: Anything you think of could most likely be done. That’s why i really like programming. Figuring out how to do some things can be a pain in the ass though haha
29/4/20 23:21 - Lorena: jaja si, hay que tener mucha paciencia!
29/4/20 23:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:24 - Joe: Hahaha
29/4/20 23:25 - Joe: Whoops
29/4/20 23:25 - Joe: More stuff to fix I suppose. It keeps your name in your local memory on your computer. I guess I could delete that when you sign off.
29/4/20 23:26 - Joe: Yeah you could say that. I’m a pretty patient dude
29/4/20 23:27 - Lorena: jaja a mi no me importa, solo para que lo sepas!
29/4/20 23:28 - Lorena: cuantas veces se puede elegir nuevos dados?
29/4/20 23:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:29 - Joe: Log in again haha
29/4/20 23:29 - Joe: That’s me
29/4/20 23:29 - Lorena: Miré a la pantalla y estaban moviéndose los dados
29/4/20 23:30 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I’m testing it. There is a problem where it disconnects you after a while if you don’t do anything
29/4/20 23:31 - Joe: Oh and you can roll up to 5 times at the most. You have to pick up at least one die every time you roll but can pick up more if you want.
29/4/20 23:31 - Lorena: Jajaj
29/4/20 23:31 - Lorena: Pero como sé cuándo es mi turno?
29/4/20 23:32 - Lorena: Yo veo como se mueve jajaj
29/4/20 23:32 - Joe: Did you sign back in?
29/4/20 23:32 - Joe: Go back and join game again
29/4/20 23:32 - Lorena: Lo dejé abierto
29/4/20 23:32 - Lorena: Okey, voy a cerrarlo
29/4/20 23:33 - Lorena: Ya cerré. Lo ves?
29/4/20 23:34 - Joe: 🤔 I don’t see you in the game. Oh god so much wrong with my stupid game it’ll never be done Hahahaha
29/4/20 23:34 - Lorena: No me ves porque aún no entré
29/4/20 23:34 - Lorena: Voyyyy!
29/4/20 23:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:35 - Joe: Dammit hahaha. Ok go to the home page. You have to take /game off the URL. Then put your name and click join.
29/4/20 23:35 - Lorena: Ahora sí!
29/4/20 23:36 - Joe: Your turn haha
29/4/20 23:36 - Lorena: No me deja
29/4/20 23:36 - Joe: Noooooo
29/4/20 23:37 - Joe: How about now? It really doesn’t let you? Shit. I wonder why it was working with my friends the other day. Well this is embarrassing hahahah 💩
29/4/20 23:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:37 - Joe: Oh you have to roll
29/4/20 23:37 - Joe: Click roll the dice
29/4/20 23:38 - Lorena: Ah pero al principio aparecían 5 iguales
29/4/20 23:38 - Lorena: Mierda
29/4/20 23:38 - Lorena: Jaja solo una vez me dejó dar rollo the dice
29/4/20 23:39 - Lorena: Arghhhg
29/4/20 23:39 - Lorena: Jajaja me haces trampa? 🤔
29/4/20 23:39 - Joe: Hahahah no no never
29/4/20 23:40 - Lorena: Jajajaja okey ahora me hiciste ganar?
29/4/20 23:40 - Lorena: Tocando los códigos???
29/4/20 23:40 - Joe: Aaaahhh there you go! Hahaha
29/4/20 23:40 - Lorena: Jajaja
29/4/20 23:40 - Joe: Hahahaha 👨‍💻
29/4/20 23:40 - Lorena: 🖕🖕🖕
29/4/20 23:41 - Joe: 😂
29/4/20 23:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:41 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/4/20 23:41 - Lorena: Pq te salen a vos números más bajos que a mí? Jaja pq sos el creador?
29/4/20 23:42 - Lorena: Es tu turnooo
29/4/20 23:43 - Lorena: 😭😭😭😭
29/4/20 23:43 - Joe: Oooooh
29/4/20 23:43 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/4/20 23:43 - Lorena: Pero como puedes conseguir nota tan baja?
29/4/20 23:43 - Lorena: No te salen 5 o 6?
29/4/20 23:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:44 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/4/20 23:44 - Joe: Aw it disconnected us
29/4/20 23:44 - Lorena: Y esto?
29/4/20 23:44 - Lorena: Me quedé sola
29/4/20 23:44 - Joe: See it’s broken 🤬
29/4/20 23:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/4/20 23:45 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂 


Sorry that was my bad coding skills. Game still doesn’t work 100% but that was fun. Thanks for playing!!
29/4/20 23:58 - Lorena: haha don't get frustrated, there are always mistakes before something good. I support you with it, whenever you want we will try playing again! 🤙🏼
30/4/20 0:00 - Joe: Thanks! We’ll play again soon when it’s less sketchy haha
30/4/20 0:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/4/20 0:07 - Lorena: Uoo big change!!!
30/4/20 0:25 - Joe: Yeah now for animation and sound. That will definitely take some time to figure out but I’m going to take a little break for now.

So when are you done with that course? I want to see what you can do when you’re done ✅
30/4/20 0:27 - Lorena: poco a poco, creo que quedará muy bien el juego!
30/4/20 0:31 - Lorena: Today the course is very bad, We started seeing the tutorials, we have taken notes to do it, the explanation wasn't clear and when We are going to start doing the exercise on the computer, the program had a failure and the teacher recommended me to install the 2020 version. therefore, all morning wasted 😒
30/4/20 0:35 - Lorena: the course doesn´t have an exact end date...It is online and at your own pace. It depends how much it costs us to do the exercises, or if We have to repeat them again, all that takes time
30/4/20 0:36 - Joe: Damn...rough day. Tomorrow will be better 💪
30/4/20 0:38 - Joe: Oh Ok. Good luck getting through it all! Courses can be a little frustrating sometimes but especially the online ones when you’re having problems. 

At least you have your roommate doing the course with you.
30/4/20 0:49 - Lorena: Yes, although I like the dynamics of the online course, I can always watch the videos again when I have doubts and the Skype teacher solves everything at once. The study center is in Barcelona.
30/4/20 0:52 - Lorena: With her We went through different processes...anger, laughter, today finally 2 beers each and a whole bag of potatoes
30/4/20 0:54 - Lorena: Que tal se plantea tu día???
30/4/20 0:56 - Joe: Hahaha sounds like an emotional morning 


I’m doing boring stuff today. Listening to earnings calls right now 😂
30/4/20 0:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/4/20 1:20 - Lorena: jajaja, okey mm suena divertido 🙄! te dejo con ello entonces, que tengas un buen díaaaa! un besito 🙋😘
30/4/20 1:22 - Joe: Ooook. Talk to you later. Buenas noches ✌️😘
1/5/20 18:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:15 - Lorena: Hola!!!
1/5/20 18:15 - Lorena: Jajaja si, mañana nos dejan salir a la calle!!!!! A dar un paseo o hacer deporte
1/5/20 18:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:18 - Lorena: *Practicas
1/5/20 18:18 - Joe: Hahah ok ok
1/5/20 18:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:20 - Lorena: Jajajajajaj
1/5/20 18:23 - Lorena: Good memory, saying "vos", like a Uruguayan 👏✌️
1/5/20 18:29 - Joe: Haha I’m trying. 

Yesterday I spent way too much time on that dumb game but it looks waaaaaay better. So much better. My friend drew a background for the sign in and i added a chat too.
1/5/20 18:31 - Joe: I also added the sounds like you suggested but they only work on the computer. Still trying to get sounds working on tablets and phones. Hahah sorry I keep talking about my game 😂 😂
1/5/20 18:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:42 - Lorena: hahaha for nothing, for others maybe yes ... but I like that you continue with your game. What are you waiting to show me? I want to see those changes!!
1/5/20 18:46 - Lorena: Joeeeee, me encanta el cambio!
1/5/20 18:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:48 - Joe: Hahaha shit
1/5/20 18:48 - Lorena: jajaja you are letting me win!
1/5/20 18:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:49 - Lorena: JAJAJAJAJA
1/5/20 18:50 - Lorena: I get a lot of "3" lately ... haha yo´re the best!!
1/5/20 18:50 - Lorena: *You´re
1/5/20 18:50 - Joe: Muchas gracias!
1/5/20 18:50 - Joe: It’s so much better now. It was really bad when I first showed it to you hahah. I should’ve waited 😂
1/5/20 18:51 - Lorena: jajjaj Joe, eso lo acabas de hacer ahora?
1/5/20 18:51 - Lorena: me estoy riendo sola jaja, los primeros tiros me salieron super altos, y el ultimo, te dí pena y me mandaste dos tiros con "3"? o fue casualidad? jajaa
1/5/20 18:52 - Joe: What the changes? I made them all yesterday.
1/5/20 18:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 18:57 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I noticed that 😂
1/5/20 18:57 - Joe: Ok I’ll work on that. The ultimate feature will be built in translation so I can play with you hahaha
1/5/20 18:59 - Lorena: con traductor? jajaja muy profesional!
1/5/20 18:59 - Joe: I have to fix the tie also. It says the first player wins on a tie every time
1/5/20 18:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 19:00 - Lorena: sii!
1/5/20 19:00 - Joe: Oh yeah. Um you just have to go to the website again. I haven’t figured out why that happens if you press reload
1/5/20 19:01 - Lorena: In the end i couldn't bear to try it before giving you my opinion!!
1/5/20 19:02 - Joe: Hahaha I appreciate you taking the time to try it. You give good feedback that makes the game better
1/5/20 19:04 - Lorena: El otro día, iba a decirte que podrías poner un estilo de ilustración como el video que me enviaste de Benal! me gustaba la tipografía y los colores, puede ser que sea el mismo chico que te hizo esto?? jaja que casualidad, me encanta!
1/5/20 19:05 - Lorena: the sound seems to me a pluss.. it makes you want to play, it even sounds when I have the game window minimized!
1/5/20 19:07 - Lorena: and the chat is great too, you can interact with the other player. You have to add gifts or faces like in whatsapp!
1/5/20 19:08 - Lorena: como dirías vos: "siiiiiiiiiick"
1/5/20 19:08 - Joe: Haha it was the same guy! My friend Fav does all the illustrations and drew the animations in the Benal video by hand, frame by frame. He was in the video too. I love his style of illustrations
1/5/20 19:08 - Lorena: jajaja
1/5/20 19:09 - Joe: Yeah I need emojis, gifs, and pictures for the chat. That’s a little more complicated but it can be done. That would definitely make it cooler.
1/5/20 19:12 - Joe: I like how excited you are about the changes to my game hahaha. It makes me want to keep working on it
1/5/20 19:15 - Lorena: hahaha I'm glad, but it is a lot of evolution. I still love having tried the initial. if not, I couldn't have given you my opinion now
1/5/20 19:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 19:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 19:24 - Joe: Hahaha the old one was so ugly! 🤢
1/5/20 19:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 19:28 - Lorena: https://n9.cl/2f5dm
1/5/20 19:37 - Joe: Haha is that a link to my game?
1/5/20 19:38 - Joe: You are addicted haha
1/5/20 19:39 - Lorena: It is an option that a teacher once taught me to shorten links, haha ​​and I just remembered
1/5/20 19:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 19:40 - Joe: Hahahaha 😂
1/5/20 19:41 - Joe: I’m about to go on my little morning skate real quick then have some breakfast. If you’re too excited for tomorrow and can’t sleep we can play the game some more hahaha
1/5/20 20:05 - Lorena: my tomorrow night? 😑🤔
1/5/20 20:06 - Lorena: Enjoy that little walk on the skate and the pancakes with coffee!!! 😋
1/5/20 20:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/5/20 20:07 - Joe: Your tonight 😂 damn time zones
1/5/20 20:13 - Lorena: 🌊💙 super lindo!
1/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: your morning tomorrow and my night tomorrow, o my night today? hahaa 👽
2/5/20 23:11 - Joe: Hola! Todavia vos despierto?
2/5/20 23:11 - Joe: Did you go outside today? How was it?
2/5/20 23:19 - Lorena: Increíble!
2/5/20 23:20 - Lorena: I'm happyyy
2/5/20 23:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/5/20 23:41 - Joe: Haha nice! Glad you got to go out in the sun for a bit. Did you make that pizza from scratch? 

I made my own pizza from scratch last week and was all excited about it haha
2/5/20 23:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: haha before I bought all the pizza and put it in the oven directly.  Now frozen dough and fresh ingredients... Jaja poco a poco 🤷
3/5/20 0:04 - Joe: Lol I went from delivery to scratch, but only cause I didn’t have frozen dough. 


Making dough from scratch is only like 5 ingredients haha salt, yeast, oil, water, and flour. Have to wait 90 minutes for it to rise though so not great if you want it right away
3/5/20 0:05 - Joe: Anyway, enjoy your freedom 😆 

Next time you go out send some pics please. I would like to see a little bit of Madrid haha
3/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: Ahí está la clave, 90 minutos para mí es mucho. Jajaja lo haré algún día, se nota la diferencia
3/5/20 0:16 - Lorena: Haha okeyy, tomorrow I send you!
3/5/20 0:26 - Lorena: Y vos, cómo estás??
3/5/20 0:29 - Joe: I’m doing great! I’m still working on my game. It went from a dumb thing for my friends, into something I might add to my portfolio if I can polish it up nicely. 

I added rooms so everyone doesn’t have to be in the same game and that took all yesterday to figure out haha. 

And my friend that did the illustrations wants me to make a portfolio website for him too so he can show off his art stuff. 


So I’ve been busy but that’s good 😂
3/5/20 0:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

3/5/20 0:38 - Joe: I’m going to change the link soon. Need to buy a domain name first haha
3/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Jaja cuál tenés pensado?
3/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: Podrías poner uno en inglés/español haha😁
3/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Mmm I don’t know. I’ve been trying to come up with something. Waiting for the right name to come to me haha
3/5/20 0:41 - Joe: Haha I should. 

Let me know if you can think of any good names for the site 👍
3/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Mmmm.. por ejemplo? Que pensaste
3/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: ejem... ejem... vos tenés que pensar una room para nosotros
3/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: jajaja
3/5/20 0:46 - Joe: This is too true hahahahaha 

That is literally me when I have a coding problem. Only sitting around and thinking will solve it 🤣 🤣
3/5/20 0:46 - Joe: 😂 pick a name. I’ll make a room just for you haha
3/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: It is one of my favorite gifs, haha ​​it looks like you hahahah
3/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 0:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 0:49 - Joe: Naming stuff is so hard! That’s why I made most of the rooms numbers. And one “benal” room of course
3/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: JAJAJAJAJA
3/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: Until you put one on, I don't play haha 🧟‍♀️
3/5/20 0:53 - Joe: Damn....I better go lay down in a field and do some thinking until I come up with a name haha

I’ll make one soon! I swear!
3/5/20 0:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 1:04 - Joe: Hahahah
3/5/20 1:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 1:16 - Lorena: Jjj buenas noches Joe, me voy a dormir que hoy por fin estoy cansada de verdad jaja. Espero que puedas encontrar un nombre así juego mañana. Un beso!!
3/5/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 22:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Haha can’t tell. Looks cool. At least you though of me 😆
3/5/20 22:37 - Joe: So much police haha. That area looks interesting though. I bet there is tons of stuff to skate near by lol
3/5/20 23:44 - Lorena: haha is that I saw several meetings and the thought was immediate. You have to teach me to see when it is good  haha
4/5/20 0:00 - Joe: Haha it’s probably hard to notice good spots if you don’t skate. I will try to teach you though.
4/5/20 0:00 - Joe: Give me a word in spanish to practice today. The app I downloaded gave me “el alfarero” haha. I need something better than that 😂
4/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Jajaja alfarero 😂 okey okey We have to practice
4/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Empieza la clase de español, ok??
4/5/20 1:15 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:20 - Lorena: Jajaja
4/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Que te apetece practicar?
4/5/20 1:24 - Joe: I’m going to the store right now hahaha no not right now. It’s already embarrassing when no one is around. 

But if you give me a word or phrase I’ll work on it and send you audio later. I just need something better and more useful than el alfarero 😝
4/5/20 1:30 - Lorena: Mmm como? Lo primero no entendí
4/5/20 1:30 - Lorena: Que vos vas a la tienda ahora y te da vergüenza si hay alguien cerca?
4/5/20 1:34 - Lorena: Jaja alfarería es una profesión bonita, pero casi ya no se usa esa palabra. Se dice más cerámica ( pottery)
4/5/20 1:35 - Joe: Haha never mind. I thought you were going to ask me to send audio clips now for practice. 


But yeah send something useful for me.
4/5/20 1:36 - Joe: This is why I need to check with you before just learning these words haha
4/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: Ah era mentira lo de la tienda   para no grabar audio? Jaja
4/5/20 1:40 - Lorena: lo que quieras te enseño "melenas"
4/5/20 1:42 - Joe: Hahahaha
4/5/20 1:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:43 - Joe: I really did go to the store though. But it’s right across the street so I’m back already haha
4/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: Jajaja
4/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: Pinocho en español
4/5/20 1:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: Jaja dale! Come on, audio...!
4/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: "Me va a crecer la nariz como a pinocho"
4/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: Ahora vos
4/5/20 1:57 - Joe: Hahahahaha shiiiiiit
4/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: 😂
4/5/20 1:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
4/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: 🤗🤗
4/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: Perdón,tu risa me contagia
4/5/20 1:59 - Joe: Lol that my laugh of shame
4/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: Dulce! Jaja
4/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:01 - Lorena: You do it very well, repeat!
4/5/20 2:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:04 - Joe: No not good at all but thanks anyway hahaha
4/5/20 2:04 - Lorena: Si es bueno, yo no te miento jaja
4/5/20 2:06 - Lorena: Ahora pinocho mejor, pero lo dijiste muy rápido y te falta la preposición de "a"
4/5/20 2:06 - Joe: Haha good. Please tell me when it’s terrible and how to improve. 

My accent probably sounds so bad even when I get the words right though 😂
4/5/20 2:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Lol you’re right. I didn’t even notice 💩
4/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: Me va A crecer la nariz como A pinocho
4/5/20 2:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:09 - Joe: Fuuuuuck
4/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: Muy bien!!! Ahora siii
4/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: 🤣🤣
4/5/20 2:10 - Joe: Damn It seems like it’s about to be easy and then I start talking and get nervous 😩
4/5/20 2:11 - Lorena: Jaja no importa, seguimos practicando
4/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: I'm funny (lovingly)
4/5/20 2:13 - Joe: Don’t think you’re getting out of learning English. I’m going to need some clips from you too haha
4/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: Jajaja
4/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:15 - Lorena: Continuamos ..! Jaja
4/5/20 2:16 - Lorena: Ahora una frase en español pero con acento uruguayo
4/5/20 2:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:17 - Lorena: Jajajajajajaja boludo sos muy gracioso con los gifs
4/5/20 2:18 - Lorena: "Yo patino cada mañana, y después desayuno tortitas y café solo"
4/5/20 2:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:21 - Joe: Oh god this one is hard haha. I like the Uruguayan way of saying “yo”. Ok shit I’ll try but this will be the worst one yet haha
4/5/20 2:22 - Lorena: Jajaja thanks ☺️
4/5/20 2:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:22 - Joe: Sjdjcbfbejsjsj
4/5/20 2:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: Jajajajajajajaj
4/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:24 - Joe: Hahaha dammit I tried
4/5/20 2:24 - Lorena: Después  it sounded like an accent from southern Spain
4/5/20 2:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:26 - Lorena: Te salió todo bien, hay que repetir otra vez con "después" pronuncia más la "s"
4/5/20 2:27 - Joe: Lol damn really trying to have me get it right. Ok ok
4/5/20 2:28 - Lorena: 💪💪💪
4/5/20 2:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:28 - Joe: Hahah that was better I think
4/5/20 2:28 - Joe: 🤔
4/5/20 2:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:29 - Joe: Wait that one haha
4/5/20 2:29 - Joe: Not the first one. I messed up “patino” in the first and didn’t record the whole thing
4/5/20 2:31 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🏃
4/5/20 2:31 - Lorena: Perfectooooo, la segunda vez!!!!!
4/5/20 2:32 - Lorena: Si jaja
4/5/20 2:32 - Joe: I’m going to say tortitas all the time now haha I like tortitas
4/5/20 2:33 - Lorena: One thing I am going to tell you, the Uruguayan accent works very well for you, better than the Spanish jajajj
4/5/20 2:33 - Lorena: 😂🥞
4/5/20 2:36 - Joe: Nice! I never really paid attention to different accents in spanish cause it all sounded the same to me. Only thing I noticed is they talk faster in Spain haha

Now I need to go see what the Peruvian accent is supposed to be like 🤔

I’m trying to think of how my grandparents say “yo” but I’m not sure. I’ll have to call them and ask  them to speak to me in spanish
4/5/20 2:39 - Lorena: Jajaj si hay muchos acentos.. Es muy gracioso cuando algún americano o inglés aprende español en un país como sudamérica, luego habla con su acento jaja como vos ahora
4/5/20 2:40 - Lorena: Creo que en Perú se dice yo como en España,  la "y" solo se pronuncia como "sh" en Uruguay y Argentina
4/5/20 2:42 - Joe: Interesting 🤔 I didn’t know that.
4/5/20 2:42 - Lorena: please, you have to speak to your grandparents spanish, haha ​​it would be very funny that they know that you are practicing!
4/5/20 2:43 - Joe: Dammit I’m going to have a stupid accent when I’m done learning 😂 It’ll be some weird mix of all the different accents haha
4/5/20 2:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 2:44 - Joe: Haha they’ll get too excited. I’m going to be back in California in about a month so I’ll surprise them with some spanish when I get back. They’ll love it
4/5/20 2:47 - Joe: Being consistent that’s all that matters to me. I don’t want to switch between accents in the middle of sentences. People will think I’m a weirdo haha


If someone went from a New York accent to Texas accent, to California accent in a few sentences it would be super weird. I assume it would be similar switching between accents in Spanish too haha
4/5/20 2:55 - Lorena: Sería geniaaal, podríamos practicar cosas para que les digas a ellos jaja
4/5/20 2:55 - Lorena: they would understand you anyway.  I can teach you mine 🤷 It is an accent that people like a lot in Spain, it would serve you very well to flirt with a girl haha
4/5/20 2:59 - Joe: Yeah we should do that haha otherwise I’ll just tell them how I want to smoke a joint
4/5/20 3:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:06 - Lorena: Jajaja no eso no! 🤭
4/5/20 3:06 - Lorena: 😒😒😒😒😒😒
4/5/20 3:07 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂 I’d prefer an accent that works for you only but you’re the one that said it would work on all the girls hahahahaha!
4/5/20 3:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:11 - Lorena: Jajaja era una trampa 😈
4/5/20 3:12 - Joe: Hahahaha!
4/5/20 3:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:13 - Joe: Hahaha I was really just joking I’m sorry 😂 

I don’t even like talking to people hahaha
4/5/20 3:15 - Joe: But also when you say that, I kind of take it as you wanting to be just friends or something so I don’t push the issue 🤷‍♂️
4/5/20 3:15 - Joe: Even though I do like you very much hahaha 🤗🤗
4/5/20 3:17 - Joe: If you knew me well, you would’ve thought the gif was funny because I’m faaaar from a “ladies man” hahaha. I’ve had like, 3 girlfriends, all pretty long term relationships

Anyways, hope you’re not actually bummed on that 😬
4/5/20 3:17 - Lorena: Yo también bromeo todo el rato, jaja. No te gusta hablar con la gente? 🤨
4/5/20 3:18 - Joe: I’m definitely not someone that is in constant contact with my friends. I can go a pretty long time without talking to anyone haha
4/5/20 3:19 - Lorena: Jajaja a un amigo no hablo tanto, y de hecho a chicos que me hablaron durante la cuarentena y que están cerca los ignoré, me parecía más divertido hablar con vos jaja
4/5/20 3:19 - Joe: And usually I avoid talking to strangers but if it’s a cool girl from across the world or an old hippie giving weed I’ll make an exception lol
4/5/20 3:21 - Joe: Haha I’m pretty much the same. The more distance the more fun to talk to maybe 😂
4/5/20 3:22 - Lorena: Jajaja conseguí algunas palabras de cariño 🙅🤟👏. Yo siento lo mismo, aunque no puedo entender cómo con la distancia y sin conocerte en persona.. jaja
4/5/20 3:22 - Joe: It definitely helps when you make me do embarrassing things that you’re so far away
4/5/20 3:23 - Lorena: Jaja se te nota, además como sos un poco tímido. Bueno,yo tuve varios novios pero mi relación larga fueron 10 años haha no entiendo como pasaron tantos tan rápido 🤭
4/5/20 3:25 - Lorena: I love those exceptions!! 🎯
4/5/20 3:27 - Joe: Hahaha you got a little bit out of me 🤐
4/5/20 3:28 - Joe: 10 years is super long. My longest was 8.


Time is weird. It goes faster and faster as you get older too.
4/5/20 3:28 - Lorena: Jaja algo más que me quieras decir? Tengo que aprovechar este momento jajaja
4/5/20 3:29 - Lorena: Bastante tiempo también!
4/5/20 3:29 - Joe: Haha nooooo you got enough from me for one day 😂 

I’m over here telling you all kinds of shit you didn’t even ask about.
4/5/20 3:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:31 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
4/5/20 3:31 - Lorena: Bueno, ahora te lo estoy preguntando
4/5/20 3:32 - Joe: Maybe if you ask something specific I can tell you
4/5/20 3:33 - Joe: No seré un pinocho
4/5/20 3:33 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
4/5/20 3:33 - Lorena: Bien aplicado!
4/5/20 3:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:35 - Lorena: I don't know what to ask you really, haha ​​what I don't know is if you are so naive as to think that I see you only as a friend haha
4/5/20 3:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:38 - Joe: Hahahaha!
4/5/20 3:38 - Joe: Wow
4/5/20 3:38 - Joe: Uuuuh hahaha I guess so
4/5/20 3:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:39 - Joe: I have no idea what’s going on sometimes hahaha I just go with the flow 😂
4/5/20 3:40 - Joe: I could be in Spain, at your place, and still be questioning whether you see me as just a friend or not hahahaha
4/5/20 3:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:43 - Lorena: Jajajaja really?
4/5/20 3:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 3:43 - Joe: That doesn’t mean I’m not interested though. I just never notice when a girl is into me like that
4/5/20 3:43 - Joe: Hahahah pretty much
4/5/20 3:46 - Joe: Dude it’s so late!! Go to sleep hahaha don’t you have class in 6 hours? Don’t fall asleep in class again 😂 


You’ve gotten enough out of me for now. You can continue shaming me tomorrow hahah
4/5/20 3:46 - Lorena: haha yes.. I realized!!
4/5/20 3:47 - Lorena: Jaja es que dormí siesta y no tenía sueño. Pero me quedé un rato más, se puso interesante la conversación, empezó con pinocho.. 😂
4/5/20 3:50 - Joe: Lol the most random thing to start a good conversation.

Well if you want to ask more questions feel free!
4/5/20 3:50 - Lorena: Buenas noches, súper amigo a la distancia! Un beso 😘
4/5/20 3:50 - Lorena: Jajaj mañana te hago más
4/5/20 3:51 - Lorena: Aunque estoy esperando para jugar a los dados
4/5/20 3:52 - Joe: Haha we’ll play tomorrow! We can make a room with any name now 👍 

Buenas noches, Lore! Un beso 😘
4/5/20 21:32 - Joe: Hola!
4/5/20 21:33 - Joe: I finished the 2nd part of la casa de papel last night 🤯
4/5/20 21:35 - Joe: So much crazy shit happened hahaha I’m addicted to that show now. Can’t believe Moscow died. So sad 😞 
and the inspector getting into all kinds of shit haha oh man it was too much
4/5/20 21:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 22:18 - Lorena: Holaaa! Jajaja te enganchó al final la serie!
4/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: Ohhh jaja sí Moscú muere, sabía que te iba a dar pena jajaja
4/5/20 22:22 - Lorena: Pobre Denver! 😔
4/5/20 22:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 22:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 22:27 - Joe: Oooh that spot is gorgeous. I like the way the bridge looks too. 

Haha yeah, they do look like zombies 🧟‍♂️
4/5/20 22:28 - Joe: The actor that plays Denver is pretty good. Very convincing 😂 

That last episode was so epic. After I do some work I’m going to keep watching today.
4/5/20 22:30 - Lorena: Ya te enseñaré poco a poco algo más de Madrid de día cuando me dejen moverme un poco más lejos que 1km jajaja
4/5/20 22:32 - Lorena: Jaja sí es muy peculiar. Que más pasó?? Jaja te pregunto porque no quiero hacerte spoiler sin querer ya sabes jaja
4/5/20 22:33 - Joe: Haha poco a poco is good. Please don’t get arrested trying to show me Madrid 😂
4/5/20 22:34 - Joe: The last thing that happened was the inspector meeting up with the professor
4/5/20 22:34 - Joe: On the far away island 🌴
4/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: Jajajaja yo tengo imán para las multas .. y cuando me multa la policía me enojo jaja 🙃
4/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Poco a poco, puede estar en la lista de toma la cuchara y traeme la escoba Jajaja
4/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: Ah jajaja esa escena final es demasiado "cursi"
4/5/20 22:39 - Joe: Hahaha I know so many useful phrases! Basically mastered spanish at this point 😂
4/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: Jajaja 😂😂
4/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: Última escena de profesor con inspectora
4/5/20 22:41 - Joe: Hahaha yeah a little bit. he definitely wouldn’t have sat there waiting for her phone to die before saying hello when she flew all the way to some random island
4/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: Jajaj totalmente! Yo a ella no la soporto. No me gusta jaja su papel es una mierda no sabe actuar no me lo creo
4/5/20 22:44 - Joe: I agree with you there. I don’t see how the show can go on now though haha! 

Seems like that was a fine place to end it. But, 2 parts to go so I guess there is a lot more to go.
4/5/20 22:45 - Lorena: Jajaa uhhh queda mucho!
4/5/20 22:46 - Lorena: Ay que bien, sabes que?
4/5/20 22:47 - Lorena: Me había olvidado. Esto te va a venir bien para reforzar la lección de acentos en español jajaja. Entra un nuevo personaje! Es argentino! ( Tiene mi acento)
4/5/20 22:49 - Joe: Hahah cool! We’ll see if I can even notice it 😂
4/5/20 22:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 22:53 - Joe: But I put it on a domain I already own but never used haha “honecode.com” 

honecode.com
4/5/20 22:55 - Joe: Much easier to remember than the old one. But if you have any recommendations for a better name of the website I’d love to hear it haha. I can’t think of anything good 🤔
4/5/20 22:58 - Lorena: Jaja nombre para el juego decís?
4/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Si
4/5/20 22:58 - Lorena: Por qué te dicen Hone?
4/5/20 22:59 - Joe: Hahaha my friends just started calling me that a looooong time ago
4/5/20 23:01 - Joe: I got the name in high school. I guess it stuck with me ever since. Kind of fits though. I’m always trying to hone some new skill 😂 😂
4/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Pero porque? Jaja es como honey, de cariño? 🙄
4/5/20 23:04 - Joe: Haha no it’s not like that 😂 

I don’t know why. The best explanation I got from my friend that originally came up with it was because he was on mushrooms hahaha
4/5/20 23:05 - Lorena: Jajaja pero es inventado el nombre entonces?
4/5/20 23:05 - Lorena: Por un momento pensé que tus amigos te decían cariño o miel.. es raro 🤭
4/5/20 23:06 - Joe: Haha nooo. It’s hone. Like “afilar”.
4/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:09 - Joe: 😂 yeaaah I guess that would be a little weird hahaha

I don’t know. It’s a weird nickname but I didn’t pick it 🤷‍♂️
4/5/20 23:11 - Joe: You should tell me something embarrassing haha. I feel like I told you way too much yesterday and now you’re talking shit about my nickname hahaha
4/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: Jajaja nooo!
4/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: Suena bien, pero quería saber el motivo del apodo!!
4/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: Cool shiiiiiit, como dirías vos jaja
4/5/20 23:19 - Lorena: Jjj que querés que te diga?
4/5/20 23:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:21 - Lorena: Full nerd ☝️
4/5/20 23:22 - Joe: Haha I don’t know 🤔 you don’t have a secret nickname? Nothing you want to tell a stranger from across the world? 

You can trust me, who would I tell? 😂
4/5/20 23:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:23 - Lorena: Jajaj mmmm apodo no tengo, mis amigas me dicen Lore
4/5/20 23:24 - Lorena: Luego algún amigo o amiga me dice de diferente manera: boluda, uru, pecas. Pero nada de eso es vergonzoso jajaja
4/5/20 23:24 - Joe: Apodo is now my word of the day haha
4/5/20 23:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:25 - Lorena: Algo que me da vergüenza es cuando me pongo a bailar. Hoy justo antes de que me hables
4/5/20 23:26 - Lorena: Me gusta el baile africano,pero claro, veo los pasos en Youtube al final me empiezo a motivar y me los invento
4/5/20 23:26 - Joe: I liked the video you sent me of you dancing 💃 I still owe you a video. But not today hahaha

4/5/20 23:45 - Lorena: Mi objetivo es que tu abuela se sorprenda cunado hables con acento sudamericano jajaj
4/5/20 23:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:46 - Joe: Hahah sneaky sneaky
4/5/20 23:47 - Joe: 😂 I listened to my own audio and I definitely sound like a super white boy the first time haha
4/5/20 23:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:49 - Lorena: Jajajajaja basta!
4/5/20 23:50 - Joe: Haha my bad 🤗

4/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: Otra más
4/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/5/20 23:56 - Lorena: "estoy pensando usar mi apodo para el juego de dados"
5/5/20 0:00 - Joe: Haha dammit! This one is harder 😂
5/5/20 0:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:01 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_xOE_aEe8
5/5/20 0:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:02 - Joe: Yes! Thank you haha
5/5/20 0:02 - Lorena: Este chico, Dustin se hizo famoso haciendo videos, es americano y aprendió muy muy bien argentino, tiene un muy buen acento... ahi explica algunas expresiones, son las mismas que en Uruguay jaja, y como lo explica en inglés podés entenderlo
5/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: Abrazooo para vos!
5/5/20 0:05 - Joe: Yes this is perfect! I need more stuff like this haha
5/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: Está bien! Pero me dí cuenta que la pronunciación en la letra "D"se puede mejorar un poquito
5/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:13 - Joe: Haha it’s so hard! I’m trying to understand what’s wrong with my D but it sounds different all the time. Not very consistent.
5/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: JAJAJAJA
5/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: quiero escuchar, esas "d" diferentes
5/5/20 0:15 - Joe: Noooo haha. I need more English from you if you’re going to get more spanish out of me 😝
5/5/20 0:16 - Lorena: okey okey, es lo justo. jaja yo tengo un deber de hace dias que no hice. jaja decimelo otra vez, y te lo repito
5/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: "I'm ashamed, but I don't care, because Joe teaches me" same message I sent you but in English 👂
5/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Haha alright!
5/5/20 0:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:23 - Joe: Wow that was really good! I like how you say my name with your accent hahaha
5/5/20 0:25 - Lorena: Jajaja 🤡
5/5/20 0:27 - Joe: 😂 I like it. You should send more! Now i understand why you like it when I send you audio of me speaking Spanish.
5/5/20 0:30 - Lorena: hahaha if it's fun, We have to send more, although We are ashamed...surely We can learn something and laugh at it
5/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: te diste cuenta que cada uno pronuncia la "d" diferente? ejemplo.. a vos te cuesta pronunciar la "d" en apodo y en dados, y yo la pronuncio más fuerte "I don´t care"
5/5/20 0:34 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJ36egtZ4M
5/5/20 0:34 - Joe: Yeah I still don’t hear it haha. So I’m not putting enough emphasis on the “d”. It sounds like I’m missing the letter or something?
5/5/20 0:34 - Lorena: Me gusta este tema, hace tiempo no lo escuchaba
5/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: mmm a vos te falta pronunciar la d más fuerte, y a mi más suave creo...Ejemplo :apodo, dado(vos), y yo (I don´t care)
5/5/20 0:36 - Joe: The second sentence was supposed to be a question lol

I’m not pronouncing “d” strong enough or what?
5/5/20 0:38 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll try to pronounce the “d” more loudly. I thought it sounded fine when you said “I don’t care” though
5/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:44 - Joe: Hahaha I’m having a hard time with my Ds 😂
5/5/20 0:45 - Joe: I’m listening to your audio, trying to internalize that pronunciation haha
5/5/20 0:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:46 - Joe: Fuuuuuck
5/5/20 0:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:47 - Joe: Hahahaha shitty poop
5/5/20 0:47 - Joe: 💩
5/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:47 - Joe: I also hate hearing my voice so this is excruciatingly embarrassing hahaha
5/5/20 0:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: Jajajajaja me estoy riendo mucho con el primer audio
5/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: No puedo parar de escucharlo
5/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: No no no no no
5/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: Jajajaj ayyyy
5/5/20 0:49 - Joe: Hahah noooo stop listening to it 🙉 🤣
5/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Este genial!!!!!! Así perfecto!!!! Bien bien bieeen
5/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Jajaja es muy bueno, nomino aaaaapodo aaapodo aaaaaaaaaaapodoo
5/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Nomino no! Quería decir " no no no no"
5/5/20 0:51 - Joe: Hahaha I was struggling to get it right
5/5/20 0:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 0:53 - Joe: Hahaha stop it! Hahahahaha
5/5/20 0:54 - Joe: Glad I could make you laugh but damn....shame on me Hahahaha
5/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: jajaja perdón, no me rio de vos! me rio del audio, me hizo mucha graciaaa... nonoono aaaapodo, apodo.. fuck jajaja
5/5/20 0:55 - Joe: I don’t embarrass myself often, but with you it feels like everyday 😂 😂 😂 

You’re good at getting me to do stuff haha
5/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: okey, pero el segundo audio, fue muy bueno. apodo te salio perfecto!
5/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: oh noooo, sorry!!!
5/5/20 0:57 - Joe: Haha it’s ok. I give you permission to laugh at me and the audio. It’s all in good fun. 


And I don’t mind embarrassing myself for you 🤷‍♂️
5/5/20 1:01 - Joe: Make fun of me while you can. Cause I’m going to learn how to speak Spanish so good. And with any accent haha.
5/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: jaja pobrecito! pero no quiero avergonzarte negativamente, me pareces un chico geniaaal, jaja l me gustan vinculos espontaneos y naturales!
5/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: uoooooooo!!jaja
5/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 1:05 - Joe: Don’t worry, you messing with me like that probably makes me like you more anyway haha
5/5/20 1:05 - Joe: 😂
5/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: jajaja seguro, no creo que lo estes pasando demasiado mal hablando conmigo aunque te haga pasar un poquito de verguenza!
5/5/20 1:13 - Joe: I’m just a shy guy on that you found on the internet. 

I’ve never really had someone “slide in my DMs” like that hahaha so random
5/5/20 1:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 1:14 - Joe: Hahah no it’s not even embarrassing 😂
5/5/20 1:14 - Joe: I just want to know, like, why me? Hahaha
5/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: JAJAJA
5/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: no lo sé, es raro... la cuestión fue que me llegó una opción en tinder de poner ubicación en otro país, y fueron los primeros dias de cuarentena y me dio por mirar en Australia, y Hawaii, jaja... en Madrid los chicos de tinder, no me gustan nada.. jaja tienen estilo de oficina, clasicos, o muy arreglados, depilados, con ropa ajustada, muchas fotos posando.. puaj... jaja
5/5/20 1:20 - Lorena: y en Hawaii,  de repente te ví a vos, miré tu instagram y creo que te dí a seguir, y a las horas me empezaste a seguir vos
5/5/20 1:22 - Lorena: asi que es un poco dificil, decir por que a vos, al principio solo vi algunas fotos y me pareciste interesante.. intenté hablarte pero me respondiste muy seco.. pero después volvimos a hablar, y ahi noté un buena conexión, asi que por todo eso, te elijo a vos jaja
5/5/20 1:22 - Joe: Hahahah you like that I’m more of a “dirtbag” than the guys in Madrid 😂
5/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: jajaja nooo!
5/5/20 1:24 - Joe: Hahahaha ooook sure
5/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: no todos los chicos de Madrid son así.. pero  no me atrae demasiado su estilo de vida o conversación
5/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: no sé.. jajaja ahi tenés toda la explicación, te sirve?
5/5/20 1:26 - Joe: I definitely thought it was interesting when you messaged me but like I said, that hasn’t happened before so I really didn’t know how to respond other than to answer your question 😂 

Clueless
5/5/20 1:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: haha if it is logical, I don't write to boys like that normally, haha ​​I only did it once in Costa Rica, with a boy I met surfing and with nobody else..haha
5/5/20 1:30 - Joe: Hah yeah I don’t write to anyone. Ever 😂
5/5/20 1:30 - Joe: I don’t know how you got me to talk to you so much. You pulled me in slowly
5/5/20 1:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 1:33 - Lorena: Es verdad!!! jaja no tengo la necesidad de tener contactos con chicos tan lejos....!!
5/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: Yo no sé tampoco como pasó, jaja parecía que era imposible que hablemos... vos inglés, yo español. Vos Hawaii, yo España. horario completamente diferente..y vos sin whatsapp!!! jajaa no entiendo como pasó!
5/5/20 1:35 - Joe: Haha I believe you don’t worry. I was just saying, I never reach out to people.
5/5/20 1:36 - Joe: There were definitely many more convenient choices than me haha
5/5/20 1:37 - Joe: The more difficult the better for you 😂
5/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: vos sos la mejor opción
5/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: 🤐
5/5/20 1:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 1:41 - Joe: But seriously though, 12 hour time difference and a language barrier!? And I’m still the best option? Hahaha nice
5/5/20 1:42 - Lorena: haha mmm in the end you're going to make me change my mind!
5/5/20 1:42 - Joe: I’m not complaining though. Thank you very much 😂 

I didn’t choose you, but I would if I could.
5/5/20 1:43 - Joe: Lo siento 😆
5/5/20 1:44 - Joe: Ok ok enough of that. Thanks for explaining why me. I just had to ask.
5/5/20 1:46 - Lorena: jaja de nada! 👌🏻
5/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: Gracias!!🤗
5/5/20 1:57 - Joe: https://www.honecode.com

Want to play? 😂
5/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: Joeee I'm going to sleep, tomorrow again with the course, I feel like it!Que tengas un buen día y puedas avanzar con tu juego!
5/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: haha okey, un ratito para probar
5/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: room?
5/5/20 1:59 - Joe: oso
5/5/20 1:59 - Joe: 😂
5/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: jajaja good name
5/5/20 2:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Aw what??
5/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Damn my game is messing up cause I still see you
5/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Ah now I’m back. Fuck. More bugs to fix hahaha
5/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: jaja yo sigo dentro, es tu turno!
5/5/20 2:08 - Joe: It said game over so I had to reset
5/5/20 21:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: jajaja
5/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: Voy a probarlo!!!
5/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: ahora, ya!
5/5/20 21:39 - Joe: Hahaha!
5/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:06 - Joe: I think we got disconnected haha. I still have more to fix
5/5/20 22:07 - Joe: Hahaha more design tips from the master. You should work on being a web designer AND interior designer haha. 

With the web design you can work from anywhere like me 😂
5/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: jajaja la paciencia no es uno de mis mejores fuertes, ya lo sabes! jaja
5/5/20 22:09 - Lorena: aunque me gusta lo de diseño web, también me gusta el diseño editorial, al final esta todo bastante relacionado
5/5/20 22:09 - Joe: Hahahaha
5/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Yeah it’s all about having that eye for good design.
5/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Which I don’t have. As you can tell by my website and color choices hahaha
5/5/20 22:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: jajaja
5/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: mmmm
5/5/20 22:12 - Joe: I don’t like the green I chose but I’m so bad at picking colors
5/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: que tipografía es? a lo mejor puedes buscar otra!
5/5/20 22:12 - Joe: I just gave up
5/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: y colores, blanco con negro?
5/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:13 - Joe: Yes I probably should. Pretty sure I’m using Roboto
5/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: negro con negro
5/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: amarillo o el naranja con negro
5/5/20 22:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:14 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll try those colors instead of mushed pea green hahaha I pick gross colors 😂
5/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: esos 3 colores estan bien
5/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: los unicos que no "pegan" son los azules no?
5/5/20 22:17 - Joe: Aren’t they all the same? Haha. Or do you mean to match the buttons in the game? Like roll dice button.
5/5/20 22:18 - Joe: 🤔 I’m not sure what you mean. You notice a lot of small details ahah. I think you would be good at this
5/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: jajaja
5/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: me refiero a los rectangulos, que uno sobresale y podrían estar en horizontal
5/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: y el color del relleno de los rectángulos, azul no combina con el resto
5/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: I tried one thing, quickly with photoshop. But I'm not a graphic designer or anything, but maybe something like that could be better for you? haha I don't know huh, just my opinion, don't pay much attention either!
5/5/20 22:34 - Joe: Shit. More color picking haha.
5/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Hahaha damn you’re good
5/5/20 22:35 - Joe: That was quick 😂
5/5/20 22:37 - Joe: Learn to use Adobe XD and I bet you’ll be able to land freelance jobs doing graphic/web design. Cause people like me have no idea what we’re doing and need help hahah
5/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: jaja nah, yo no tengo idea, me desesperaría con los códigos! jajaa aunque tengo que reconocer que me gusta el diseño grafico, intento aplicarlo en las presentaciones de mis diseños, pero no sé, lo de tu juego es solo una opinión, me dieron ganas de probarlo! jajaja
5/5/20 22:46 - Joe: Adobe XD is mostly drag and drop. More similar to using photoshop than coding. You would be good at it. 

Then you hand the design off to someone like me to build it. 


When you’re ready to design a site for your interior design stuff, try out Adobe XD and I’ll build what you come up with haha
5/5/20 22:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 22:48 - Lorena: o sabía tampoco la diferencia, pensé que un desarrollador web, hacia todo.. el diseño y el trabajo de los "codigos" jajaja
5/5/20 22:50 - Lorena: *No
5/5/20 22:51 - Lorena: thanks for the words, if one day I discover my new profession I will call you hahaha
5/5/20 22:53 - Joe: Haha yeah it’s a pretty cool program for making small designs. I should really practice using it and work on my design skill 😂 

I guess I would be considered developer, not a designer. The people that are really good at both are rare but I’d like to get there one day
5/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: siiii, deberías empezar a usarlo, y así ya tienes algo más en tu portfolio! yo creo que para tener ojo, hay que ver cosas, inspirarte, al final así podés diferenciar lo que te gusta y lo que no te gusta, y ser más crítico
5/5/20 23:04 - Joe: You should’ve seen some of my first website hahaha. Oh god. They looked like they were designed by a 5 year old with a crayon 😂
5/5/20 23:05 - Joe: Design is weird to me cause of the subjectivity. The code either works, or it doesn’t. But the design is much harder to tell if it’s good in my opinion
5/5/20 23:06 - Joe: Well...I can tell when something is ugly, and I can tell when it looks good. But coming up with the good looking design in my mind is so difficult!
5/5/20 23:20 - Lorena: (voy a cenar, te escribo  cuando acabe y vaya a mí habitación oso)
5/5/20 23:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/5/20 23:24 - Joe: Hahaha ok, enjoy!
6/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: Ya estoy!
6/5/20 0:41 - Lorena: Jajajaja cuando empezaste? Mi primer plano fue horrible también! 😂
6/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Jaja sí tenés razón, es muy subjetivo. De hecho hay gente que se dedica al diseño y no comparto para nada su estilo.Pero ahí están, y se ganan la vida con ello.  Los códigos funcionan o no funcionan, me parece muy difícil! Pero supongo que entretenido cuando ya sabes hacerlo!
6/5/20 0:44 - Joe: Yeah when I first started making websites. They were all so ugly. Good thing I didn’t save those haha
6/5/20 0:46 - Joe: The best part is you never fully know how to code so there is always a bunch you can learn. Makes it so it doesn’t get boring
6/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: Jaja buena explicación! Feo o bueno. Debes inspirarte entonces para luego hacer cosas como las que te parecen buenas o te gustan
6/5/20 0:47 - Joe: Hahah yeah I dont visit enough websites but I started going to random ones for bigger companies to get an idea of how the pros do it
6/5/20 0:47 - Joe: I’m really far off from their style hahaha but if I get a design I can make it so it doesn’t matter too much I guess.
6/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: hahaha  but how many years ago?  I found a folder with my first works, they are like an intimate diary when you are little, that you would be ashamed to see someone.
6/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: You will have to try!  Save yourself reference images, fonts that you like, color combination, shape distribution, etc...
6/5/20 0:50 - Joe: Look at 3:00, have you ever heard of that haha?

https://youtu.be/ij3qiyyXbJY
6/5/20 0:52 - Joe: About 2 years ago is when I first started making websites but I was doing other kind of coding before that for a year or two.
6/5/20 0:53 - Joe: Yeah I need to get better at typography and color combinations the most but also general layout. 
There are also people that are experts in “UX” design which is “user experience” haha
6/5/20 0:54 - Joe: I need to improve in my UX skills also haha it’s never ending
6/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: Jaja no conozco ninguna expresión de Perú la verdad, me parecen super raras jajaja. Conozco el acento, conocí a alguna persona de Perú pero poco rato
6/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: Los uruguayos no tenemos mismo acento que peruanos, ni expresiones. Uruguay y Argentina son muy iguales. A mí en España me confunden continuamente con Argentina, pero no con peruana
6/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha ok I’ll learn the Peruvian phrases and teach you 😂
6/5/20 0:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 0:57 - Lorena: Solo digo para que puedas imaginarte cosas en tu cabeza, debes inspirarte un poco, y esos detalles te pueden ayudar!
6/5/20 0:58 - Lorena: Jajajaja yo también quiero eso! Nunca acaba esto.. Joe ahora vos me estás sumando más cosas que tengo que aprender jajajaja
6/5/20 0:58 - Joe: Definitely! I really appreciate it! I take criticism of my work pretty well. I just want to get better at doing things haha
6/5/20 0:58 - Lorena: 😂
6/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: Siiiiiii! Buen oído!!!!!!! 👏👏
6/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: Él está imitando el acento nuestro, jaja es muy malo jajaja
6/5/20 1:00 - Joe: Hahaha I was wondering if it was really bad or not. You can hear Denver talking shit about the accent after he says it hahaha
6/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: they are constructive criticism.  I love that they tell me!  then I decide if it works for me or not, hahaha but many times you focus on things that someone else may see from the outside and you had not realized
6/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: I like your work, your dice game, that's why I give you some opinion  haha
6/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jaja sí Denver dice " el peor acento que he escuchado en mi vida tronco"
6/5/20 1:05 - Lorena: Tronco en españa es como boludo .. especialmente en Madrid se dice tronco ( chico) tronca ( chica)
6/5/20 1:05 - Lorena: Que paaaaasa tronco?
6/5/20 1:06 - Joe: Thank you 🙏🏽 you got to see the game evolve over time haha it’s getting better slowly.
6/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: Sería como "What's up dude "
6/5/20 1:06 - Joe: You had some good input that made it noticeably better
6/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Tengo las imágenes originales jaja, las guardaré para el final
6/5/20 1:07 - Joe: Now you’re speaking my language. Que pasa tronca??? Hahaha
6/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Jajajaja
6/5/20 1:07 - Joe: Que pasa boluda?? Hahaha
6/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Si usas el boluda mejor de qué pasa.. sería...

6/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:10 - Joe: Alright well your Peruvian slang word for the day is “chela”

6/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: Jajaja esa me la sé obviooo
6/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:12 - Joe: Hahahahahaha of course

6/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: Repeat
6/5/20 1:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:16 - Joe: Hahaha what!? Dammit
6/5/20 1:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Hahahaha I couldn’t even
6/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Hahaha I’m laughing too hard
6/5/20 1:18 - Joe: Ok ok ok aaaah breathe
6/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
6/5/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

6/5/20 1:19 - Joe: Hahahah im going to have fun practicing this
6/5/20 1:20 - Joe: Terrible. Just terrible hahah
6/5/20 1:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:20 - Joe: Oh well 😔
6/5/20 1:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Jajajaja
6/5/20 1:21 - Joe: Que palta
6/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: La letra D mucho mejor

6/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Que significa la expresión que palta? 🙄
6/5/20 1:22 - Joe: I know. You should watch that first video at 3:00 hahah
6/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: Jaja okey que verguenza!
6/5/20 1:23 - Joe: Jaja si
6/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: Estás muy motivado aprendiendo español eh??
6/5/20 1:23 - Joe: Siiiiiiiw
6/5/20 1:24 - Joe: Siiiiii hahaha
6/5/20 1:24 - Lorena: Jajaja viendo vídeos en YouTube,traductor, hablando conmigo, viendo la casa de papel
6/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:26 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I nerd out and get kind of hyper focused when I want to learn something. I should’ve learned a long time ago though
6/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:30 - Joe: motivación para aprender jajaja
6/5/20 1:32 - Lorena: Jajaja una pregunta sabes cómo funciona lo de la marihuana en California?
6/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: the job of cutting Maria into farms?
6/5/20 1:36 - Joe: Mmmm I mean...I used to work at a marijuana distribution center in California so I know a little bit of how it works haha
6/5/20 1:37 - Joe: I don’t know what you mean by this
6/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: Contame!!! Jaja
6/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: Jajaj no???
6/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: 🤨🤔🤨🤔🧐🤔
6/5/20 1:39 - Joe: Well....it’s all legal, just a lot of regulations. But a licensed farmer takes the crop and gets it tested by the state for purity and quality. They also give the THC/ CBD content as a % of weight.
6/5/20 1:41 - Joe: Then the farmer can sell it to a distribution center like the place I worked at. We were small and only would buy maybe 10-20 pounds at a time but big places buy way more. 

We take the weed and package it in 1/8ths or 1gram packages or we would make joints with this machine that could make 100 joints at a time haha
6/5/20 1:41 - Joe: Then we take our packed product and sell them to retail marijuana stores that can sell to anyone 21+
6/5/20 1:42 - Joe: Basically like any other business but a lot of paperwork and regulations. It was an interesting job. It was only me and one of my friends working the whole distribution so it was really fun hahaha
6/5/20 1:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: hahaha interesting, good job!  you know it well haha
6/5/20 1:46 - Joe: I was really good at that job and like it a lot but they treated my friend like shit, then when they fired him I just walked out haha
6/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: I was referring to working on a farm.  I met many people in Costa Rica and even in Spain who were going to make a season to California. They say you make a lot of money!
6/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: although the work is very hard
6/5/20 1:47 - Joe: Oooh ok. Yeah I’ve done trimming one season and I didn’t like it hahah. That was more farm work
6/5/20 1:48 - Joe: My cousin grows so I tried it with him one year. I like the distribution side haha
6/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Ohhh hijos de puta. Bueno por lo menos aprendiste jjjj
6/5/20 1:48 - Joe: Usually seasonal work on a farm involves trimming the plant. Usually paid per pound so it’s good money if you’re fast and know how to trim good but when you’re learning it’s not that great haha
6/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Jajaj posh boy
6/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Haha it was their loss not mine. They thought I’d stay when they fired him. Like I said, we ran the whole thing haha. 

Plus i had another job at the time. I only took the distribution gig cause my friend worked there
6/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Hahaha distribution is hard too!! It had way more variety of stuff to do though and I just found it more fun.
6/5/20 1:51 - Joe: The real posh boys are the ones in the retail part hahah
6/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: Si decía ohh por el. Vos buen amigo por irte también! ☺️
6/5/20 1:52 - Joe: They don’t do shit but give the person what they order and they get tips and all kinds of shit.  You’d probably make hella good money working at a cannabis club hahaha
6/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: Jijijij 🤭
6/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: Como se dice en inglés una persona joven... Que se viste con ropa de marca, habla como raro .. que tiene dinero y suele ser de sus padres?
6/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: Posh para chico y chica? O eso sería elegante?
6/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: En España es pijo/pija y en Uruguay cheto/cheta
6/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 2:01 - Joe: Hahahaha yeah I think “posh” is good for boy and girl like that. English doesn’t make too many changes based on masculine/feminine. That is one thing that makes spanish hard for me haha
6/5/20 2:02 - Joe: When to say “o” or “a” kind of makes sense to me but in practice, switching between them at the right time can be a little hard
6/5/20 2:03 - Joe: Mostly when speaking. If I’m typing it’s easier
6/5/20 2:04 - Lorena: Jajaj claro, dicen que el español es muy difícil ... Yo ya lo hablo y no me doy cuenta ... Menos mal jaja
6/5/20 2:05 - Lorena: Pero para mí es raro también no poder decir la palabra sin indicar el género....
6/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 2:09 - Joe: Hahahahaha!!
6/5/20 2:09 - Joe: “I love my bitches” hahahahahaha
6/5/20 2:09 - Joe: 💀
6/5/20 2:09 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
6/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: Sé lo que significa, esta frase la acabo de poner para mostrarte el ejemplo jajaja. Pero un día iba a escribirte mucho texto con el traductor y estaba la palabra de perras y no me di cuenta y cuando lo fui a revisar me hizo la traducción como bitches 😱
6/5/20 2:11 - Lorena: Otro ejemplo diferente..
6/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: posh (pijo en España)
6/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: Peeeero en Uruguay pija es otra cosa
6/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: Jajajaja hay que tener mucho cuidado con el traductor
6/5/20 2:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 2:14 - Joe: Hahah ok i see what you’re saying 😂 translations are pretty funny though
6/5/20 2:15 - Joe: Siiii.  Now I’m worried about all the things I’ve sent you without checking hahaha
6/5/20 2:19 - Lorena: hahaha nah, you didn't say anything weird
6/5/20 2:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 2:26 - Lorena: Me voy a dormir Joe, que tengas buena tardeee. Un besooo!😘
6/5/20 2:27 - Joe: Muchas gracias. Buenas noches Lore. Un beso 😘
6/5/20 17:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 17:52 - Joe: Hahahahaha
6/5/20 17:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 17:58 - Lorena: Jajajaja estás despierto!!!!
6/5/20 18:11 - Joe: 😂
6/5/20 18:11 - Joe: Barely
6/5/20 18:12 - Joe: I’m so sleepy haha
6/5/20 18:12 - Lorena: I'm sorry 🙏
6/5/20 18:12 - Lorena: Jajaja pero tenía ganas de escribirte 🤭
6/5/20 18:12 - Joe: Aaah no don’t worry you didn’t wake me
6/5/20 18:17 - Joe: Ooooh my eyes are barely open hahah
6/5/20 18:17 - Joe: I changed my game to look like that photoshopped image you made.
6/5/20 18:17 - Joe: Looks better 👍
6/5/20 18:19 - Lorena: Jajaja video selfie!
6/5/20 18:20 - Joe: Hahahaha I’m gross
6/5/20 18:20 - Lorena: Really???? 😯
6/5/20 18:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:22 - Lorena: Desde el teléfono, voy a ver desde la compu!
6/5/20 18:22 - Joe: Lore, el diseñador de páginas web
6/5/20 18:23 - Lorena: Jajaja super dormido!
6/5/20 18:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:23 - Joe: Hah yeah I made sure to try to make it look good on all devices. Took a while
6/5/20 18:24 - Lorena: La (femenino) jjj
6/5/20 18:24 - Joe: Hahah fuckin Spanish
6/5/20 18:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:27 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🤷
6/5/20 18:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:30 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
6/5/20 18:30 - Lorena: Esta re (hella) gordoo, me encanta su postura
6/5/20 18:33 - Joe: Little man need some exercise 😂 poor guy. 

I swear he wasn’t that big a few months ago. I guess that’s what happens when all you do is eat and sleep haha
6/5/20 18:34 - Lorena: Jajajaja pobre Oniii, pero es muy gracioso gordo...Y sus patitas muy flacas
6/5/20 18:39 - Joe: Hahaha yeah he is a weird shape. I know you sent all those dog pics, but they’re not with you in Madrid right?
6/5/20 18:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:45 - Lorena: nooo, ellas viven con mis padres
6/5/20 18:46 - Lorena: viví unos años con ellas, y como voy a menudo a la sierra las veo!
6/5/20 18:47 - Joe: Haha thanks 🙏🏽 you’re now the designer for my game 😆
6/5/20 18:48 - Lorena: jajajaja
6/5/20 18:48 - Lorena: esto no me lo hubiese imaginado al empezar a hablar con vos jajaja
6/5/20 18:49 - Joe: At the end I’ll add a hidden “about” page. “Built by Joe. Designed by Lore” hahaha.
6/5/20 18:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 18:51 - Joe: Hahaha
6/5/20 18:52 - Joe: “Teamwork makes the dream work” I think the saying goes....or something like that 😂
6/5/20 18:52 - Joe: How was the course today? You figure out that leaf texture??
6/5/20 18:54 - Lorena: jajaja si,  tus amigos siguen jugando? jaja al final todos vamos poniendo algo de nuestra parte
6/5/20 18:55 - Lorena: but I have to tell you one thing.....🙄 the left side in red, I see it too striking. However, I like the rest! There are no more blue, red, green boxes ... just green and gray. The chat box has the same style as the user box 👌🏻
6/5/20 18:57 - Joe: Haha another example of me being terrible with colors!
6/5/20 19:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 19:15 - Joe: Haha alright cool! Sounds like I have something to do today now 😂 

Yeah I was thinking the logo should be on the dice page too. Ok ok, smaller chat and logo. What should I do with the “players” make it smaller? Different color? Get rid of it? I dont knooooow
6/5/20 19:15 - Joe: I appreciate the thought you’re putting into this haha it really does help a lot
6/5/20 19:22 - Joe: I would help you with your leaf textures on 3ds Max but I have no clue how that works 😂
6/5/20 19:26 - Lorena: jajajaja me gustaría que puedas ayudarme con eso, hoy fue frustrante también al principio, pero lo conseguí! jaja hice la entrega finalmente
6/5/20 19:27 - Lorena: 💙🔥🎲
6/5/20 19:27 - Lorena: De nada ☺️
6/5/20 19:28 - Lorena: mmmmmm
6/5/20 19:31 - Lorena: I'm thinking, this is new to me. It occurs to me that the logo, may be like an animation, when a player wins, that appears on the center screen..
6/5/20 19:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 19:34 - Joe: Oooooh that might be difficult to make it work, but cool idea, I could see that making it a lot more dynamic and engaging
6/5/20 19:34 - Joe: I’ll see what I can do
6/5/20 20:03 - Lorena: the fucking plant gives me headaches, but the previous exercises in this block were really good for us, just a mind and on a high note..
6/5/20 20:06 - Lorena: hahah your work piles up, buddy!
6/5/20 20:14 - Joe: When you make something you worked really hard on or you’re proud of, send some photos
6/5/20 20:16 - Joe: Aaah it’s a good thing. These ideas will help make everything look complete instead of like a half finished project. Plus any tips you give me to work on are good practice for me.
6/5/20 20:16 - Joe: You’re definitely keeping me busy though boss haha
6/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: jajaja
6/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: Si, claro! te mandaré!!
6/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: quién es el jefe? jajaja acabo de abrir photoshop
6/5/20 20:19 - Joe: 😂 😂
6/5/20 20:20 - Joe: Next it will be Adobe XD. You’ll be working from the beach in Costa Rica designing dice games on the internet hahaha
6/5/20 20:21 - Lorena: jaja no estaría mal, venís conmigo???
6/5/20 20:23 - Joe: I’ll be there!
6/5/20 20:23 - Joe: Just need my passport
6/5/20 20:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:41 - Lorena: jaja sacate el pasaporte ya!
6/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: mirá Joe, probé esto, la intención era mostrarte solo lo del chat, y fui agregando más cosas!!! jaja me falta jugadores
6/5/20 20:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:46 - Joe: Hahaha dammit!!!!
6/5/20 20:46 - Joe: Si, jefe! Jajajaja
6/5/20 20:47 - Joe: Jefaaaaaaa 😂
6/5/20 20:47 - Joe: Just kidding. It looks pretty cool. But how do people know the score?
6/5/20 20:48 - Joe: It definitely seems like the more simple you make it the better it looks hahaha. Less is more or something
6/5/20 20:48 - Lorena: me falta jugadores, en lateral izquierdo
6/5/20 20:49 - Joe: Ooooh that’s what you meant
6/5/20 20:49 - Joe: Ok ok
6/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: jajaja si
6/5/20 20:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:51 - Joe: That’s the small detail I need. Oooh this is going to be good. I’m already starting to make changes now haha
6/5/20 20:51 - Joe: Hahaha soon. Very soon I promise.
6/5/20 20:53 - Lorena: jajaja, el logo ahi arriba, puede sustituir a la animación central del logo, así no se te acumula trabajo!
6/5/20 20:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:55 - Lorena: esto te sirve?
6/5/20 20:56 - Joe: Haha yeah I can use those, thanks 😊
6/5/20 20:57 - Joe: Animation sounded kind of cool haha
6/5/20 20:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 20:57 - Lorena: mmm habría que pensar como poner los jugadores
6/5/20 20:58 - Lorena: hahaha I never play anything on computer (I even laughed at a friend who likes video games) I don't know how it is .. I just remember mario bross as a little hahaha
6/5/20 20:59 - Joe: Haha I know. It has to be somewhere you can see it though. Maybe a button so it only is like that if you want to see it, but you can also push it to make it go away
6/5/20 20:59 - Joe: True. Doesn’t need to be too big I guess
6/5/20 21:00 - Lorena: chat?
6/5/20 21:01 - Joe: Players. I can probably make it small. I don’t know haha I guess I don’t play enough games either 😂
6/5/20 21:01 - Joe: I should go play some games. It will be “research”
6/5/20 21:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:10 - Lorena: mmm damn, I'm not sure about that. haha
6/5/20 21:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:11 - Joe: This looks super good! Only thing is that more than 2 people can play.
6/5/20 21:12 - Joe: I haven’t put a limit yet but it’ll probably be a 6 or 7 person limit
6/5/20 21:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:14 - Lorena: Lo que estoy pensando es....
6/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: Cuáles serán mis próximos deseos que me tenés que dar
6/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: Jajaja
6/5/20 21:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 21:22 - Lorena: 👌funciona bien!
6/5/20 22:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 22:06 - Joe: I’m stoked haha it’s starting to look decent
6/5/20 23:10 - Lorena: Omg
6/5/20 23:11 - Lorena: Omg I closed my eyes for a second to rest and stayed asleep until now, pffff
6/5/20 23:15 - Joe: Hahaha that’s ok. I’ve been hard at work. Now all the changes you suggested are done 😂
6/5/20 23:15 - Joe: I’m about to build a table with my sister right now I guess. We’re staining the wood
6/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: Muy bien quedó!
6/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: Lo único un poquito más chico el logo ? Jajaja
6/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: No puedo parar jaja mándame a la mierda Joe
6/5/20 23:18 - Joe: Hahahaha!!!

6/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/5/20 23:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

8/5/20 7:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 7:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 7:47 - Joe: Looks like a beautiful morning. I’d be awake at the crack of dawn with that window haha. I have blackout curtains but my body still knows the sun is coming up somehow
8/5/20 7:47 - Lorena: Jjjj a que se dedica ella?
8/5/20 7:49 - Lorena: Jajaja si increíble.. a mí me gusta despertarme con la luz.... Bueno son las 8 acá por eso me desperté temprano jaja
8/5/20 7:51 - Joe: She one of the managers at a jewelry store. One of those ones that let you open an oyster to get a pearl. Then they set the pearl in jewelry.
8/5/20 7:53 - Joe: Well they also sell jewelry without the oyster and pearl thing but I think the pearl thing is interesting haha. 

But she is always making cool stuff for fun so I’m trying to make her sell stuff and make a few bucks.
8/5/20 7:56 - Joe: Oh god if you think 8 is early you’d think I’m insane sometimes hahaha
8/5/20 8:01 - Lorena: Suena interesante, seguro que se vienen muchas perlas de ostras. En que la ayudas, a vender muebles?
8/5/20 8:03 - Lorena: Jajaja si sé que vos te despertas super temprano, yo puede que abra los ojos dos veces pero no tengo problemas de sueño, lo más pronto que puedo despertarme es a las 8 y lo máximo a las 10
8/5/20 8:04 - Lorena: I have a "gift" for you 😊
8/5/20 8:07 - Joe: I just helped her make this one but I want to make her a website. My brother can do the marketing haha. She just has to make things she likes making. 


I just want to help her make money doing something she already likes to do anyway haha
8/5/20 8:07 - Joe: Ooooh what is it????
8/5/20 8:08 - Lorena: Que bieen, buen equipo de hermanos!!!
8/5/20 8:08 - Joe: Haha I know my time is too early for most people so I stay pretty quiet in the morning
8/5/20 8:09 - Joe: Haha siii!
8/5/20 8:10 - Joe: But what’s the “gift”? I need to know
8/5/20 8:10 - Joe: 🤔
8/5/20 8:10 - Lorena: Jaja es una tontería, regalo a distancia
8/5/20 8:11 - Lorena: Como no me explicaste como tenía que ser al final... Ayer llegué a un sitio de paseo y vi muchas barandillas jaja 🤷
8/5/20 8:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:13 - Joe: Nice rail 😂 looks hard with the break in the middle but low enough to get on. That ground might need some work haha
8/5/20 8:15 - Joe: A lot of skaters call the rails with 2 side by side “shotgun” rails
8/5/20 8:15 - Lorena: Jaja son escaleras, como la vi larga. Hay otras barandillas que tenían en la esquina un borde supongo que para que nadie patine
8/5/20 8:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:16 - Joe: Yeah the stairs look so long haha. Need more height, less length to jump down without grinding the rail
8/5/20 8:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:17 - Lorena: 🤭😂
8/5/20 8:17 - Joe: Haha I don’t expect you to know 🤷‍♂️
8/5/20 8:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:18 - Joe: But I definitely appreciate the pictures!
8/5/20 8:18 - Lorena: Justo estaba grabando la catedral y escuché unas ruedas muy cerca jaja
8/5/20 8:18 - Joe: Aaaaaye skater dude and a castle haha
8/5/20 8:19 - Lorena: Conseguiré verlo mejor algún día, ayer los vecinos me miraban.. no entendían por qué hacía foto a las barandillas jaja
8/5/20 8:20 - Joe: Hahaha I always get looked at weird when I’m taking pictures of spots to show my friends. I know the feeling 😂
8/5/20 8:21 - Lorena: Jajaj bueno lo siento, fue un regalo de mierda
8/5/20 8:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 8:23 - Joe: I accept your gift and I appreciate it very much. You took a picture of a random rail and people looked at weird for me haha.

8/5/20 15:53 - Lorena: Podrías ver un documental de la segunda guerra mundial o de animales seguro te dormís rápido, antes para mí eso era un sedante jajajaja
8/5/20 15:53 - Lorena: 🙈🙈🙈 jajaja Joe!
8/5/20 15:54 - Joe: Hahaha dude I always use boring videos to fall asleep 😴 

I’ll watch some boring talk about programming or something and nod off.
8/5/20 15:55 - Joe: Keep sending them! The collection will be very big in the end hahaha
8/5/20 15:59 - Lorena: hahaha expert mode, I leave you watching your video to sleep, with programming I would fall asleep in seconds haha
8/5/20 16:00 - Lorena: well, I didn't drink coke or bad soft drinks ... the beer is great, it's proven!
8/5/20 16:00 - Lorena: 🙄
8/5/20 16:00 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll talk to you a little later. Going to try and get a few more hours of sleeeeeeep
8/5/20 16:01 - Joe: Haha don’t worry I love the beer pictures. No shame.
8/5/20 16:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 16:03 - Lorena: Jajaja okey, descansaaa!!!
8/5/20 16:03 - Joe: Hahahahahaha!!
8/5/20 16:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 16:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/5/20 19:35 - Joe: Now I’m awake and more tired than the first time I woke up aaaaah
8/5/20 19:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 10:10 - Lorena: Hola dormilón, cómo estás?
9/5/20 10:10 - Lorena: Jajaja más cansado que antes
9/5/20 10:21 - Joe: I’m goooood. Just thinking about how I only have 1 month until my flight back to California. 

I really like it here hahaha
9/5/20 10:21 - Joe: How are you doing today??
9/5/20 11:11 - Lorena: Ohhhh solo un mes, y por qué no te quedas? Si al final no hay surfcamp no??
9/5/20 11:12 - Lorena: Nada hoy sin curso, libre.. ayer me escapé a la calle jaja me hicieron un certificado de trabajo falso por si me paraba la policía y me tomé unas cervezas jajaja
9/5/20 11:39 - Joe: I don’t know. I’m thinking about it. I’m supposed to finish filming my next video part too though. But I definitely think I’ll end up leaving CA pretty quickly if I go back
9/5/20 11:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 11:57 - Lorena: Ohhh el video claro
9/5/20 11:57 - Lorena: Cuánto cuesta un vuelo de Cali a Hawaii?
9/5/20 11:58 - Lorena: Jijijijiji 🤭🤭🤭
9/5/20 11:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 11:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 12:05 - Joe: Damn they’re serious out there haha
9/5/20 12:07 - Joe: Hmm I think it was $250 to get from Ca to Hawaii. 
But I bought my flight back right at the very beginning of this whole coronavirus thing so it was only $100 for my flight back.
9/5/20 12:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 12:08 - Lorena: Chico inteligente!!!!
9/5/20 12:10 - Lorena: You could still look for a spot in Hawaii to add to your video, and some shot skating in paradise with the flowers haha
9/5/20 12:14 - Joe: Haha I wish! We use a certain camera and basically my friend that puts it all together would never use footage I got of myself out here. It wouldn’t look right without the right equipment and someone to film. 

I wanted them to come out here but there is a 14 day quarantine period if you come to the island right now and they wouldn’t come for long enough for it to be worth it.
9/5/20 12:17 - Joe: You can’t wait to have all your freedom back 😂
9/5/20 12:19 - Lorena: Ohhhh qué pena, sería genial. Bueno pierdes hacer alguna tomita de recuerdo ahí patinando, sabes editar?
9/5/20 12:21 - Lorena: Podés no pierdes
9/5/20 12:21 - Joe: Hahaha actually I do. I used to make YouTube videos a few years ago 😂

9/5/20 12:25 - Joe: I should delete those. Or make them private or something hahah. Dammit I can’t believe you found those already haha
9/5/20 12:26 - Lorena: Jajajajajajajaj
9/5/20 12:26 - Lorena: I'm sorry

9/5/20 12:38 - Lorena: I like you the same with the videos
9/5/20 12:39 - Joe: Thaaaanks. I guess it’s fine that you found them as long as you don’t hold it against me hahaha
9/5/20 12:40 - Joe: Oh god I really felt the embarrassment on that one though 🤦‍♂️
9/5/20 12:41 - Joe: The “influencer” thing and the gifs ahahhaha fucker
9/5/20 12:41 - Lorena: Jajaja noooo, solo nos reímos entre los dos
9/5/20 12:42 - Lorena: Tuve un poco de miedo cuando los encontré, dije fuck youtuber empalagoso no por favor
9/5/20 12:43 - Lorena: Pero no eras así para nada, aunque se nota que los hiciste hace años me pareció bueno encontrarlos y ver tus expresiones, risa jaja me gusta
9/5/20 12:44 - Joe: Well at least you didn’t hate the way I am in the videos haha
9/5/20 12:45 - Joe: Shit....I wonder how many people that meet me end up finding those videos 🤔 

I always think about putting them on private but I never do
9/5/20 12:47 - Lorena: Para nada, se nota que sos buen pibe y simpático ( no sé esto como será en el traductor, pibe es como chico)
9/5/20 12:48 - Lorena: Jaja no sé, no creo que mucha tampoco... Al final estás en instagram. Pero no creo que debas borrarlos

9/5/20 13:07 - Lorena: my fucking burger is going to get cold
9/5/20 13:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 13:08 - Joe: Aaaaaah not a cold burger.

Anyway, I’m going to sleep now. Talk to you later. Have a good day!
9/5/20 13:38 - Lorena: Perdona pasó algo grave con el hermano de Sandra y estaba consolandola que llegué a casa recién.
9/5/20 13:39 - Lorena: Este es bonito!
9/5/20 13:39 - Lorena: Alto no?
9/5/20 13:41 - Lorena: Me encanta! Es re lindo, con la forma de la arquitectura, colores, palmeras 😍
9/5/20 13:41 - Joe: Nooo worries! I’m just getting tired so I’m probably going to fall asleep in a second here haha. I can feel it coming so if I stop messaging you, you know why 😴
9/5/20 13:42 - Joe: It’s about perfect I would say. Not too high, not too low.
9/5/20 13:42 - Lorena: Siii es super tarde ahí! 🐻
9/5/20 13:43 - Lorena: Yo lo veo alto jaja perfecto para romperme un tobillo! Y no hay video de esa barandilla?
9/5/20 13:43 - Joe: Haha yeah that place is my nice and it has my favorite thing to skate so it’s a cool spot.
9/5/20 13:45 - Joe: No video of the railing 😞 I would really only skate a rail like that if I was filming with my friends. Hard to get the motivation to skate stuff like that alone
9/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: Yo creo que ya estoy preparada para buscar spots en Madrid de bancos y repisas jajaja
9/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: Vos tendrás que buscar cosas de diseño en Hawaii, alguna casita d esas d colores 😍
9/5/20 13:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 13:49 - Joe: Haha yesssss you’re getting it. I’m looking forward to these pictures 😂 

And yeah, I’ll try to get photos of architecture that catches my eye.
9/5/20 13:49 - Lorena: Claro, lo entiendo!
9/5/20 13:50 - Joe: Those are cute. I see what kind of small houses you like haha. I’ll send photos when I see them
9/5/20 13:51 - Lorena: Jajaja buen trueque!
9/5/20 13:51 - Lorena: Te dejo dormir Joe, que es tarde y me vas a matar! Jajaja
9/5/20 13:53 - Joe: Hahaha alright alright maybe I should sleep. You’re waking me back up!
9/5/20 13:53 - Joe: I don’t have anything planned tomorrow so it’s ok haha. No worries.
9/5/20 13:53 - Lorena: Jajaja si ahora te vas a dormir pensando en patinar. Dulces sueños con Oni, un beso! 😘😘
9/5/20 13:54 - Lorena: Hablame luego!! 😚
9/5/20 13:54 - Joe: Haha talk to you tomorrow. Un beso
9/5/20 20:15 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 20:17 - Joe: Aaaaaah I just remembered what you found last night Hahahaha. So good. Whatever, it’s cool.
9/5/20 20:27 - Lorena: El que, el justificante?
9/5/20 20:31 - Joe: YouTube haha. I couldn’t believe it when you said you already watched some of them 🤦‍♂️ 

I could feel my cheeks turning red and that doesn’t happen to me....ever
9/5/20 20:34 - Lorena: Ah mierda claro es que tu noche fue hoy mi mañana
9/5/20 20:35 - Joe: Oh yeah, my last night hahaha
9/5/20 20:36 - Lorena: Hahaha really?  I was quiet, as I saw that you're ashamed of some things ... and so you don't think I'm crazy hahaha
9/5/20 20:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Haha yes really
9/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Hahahaha!
9/5/20 20:41 - Joe: All you had to say was you found them. I know what the videos are like so once you said you saw a few I could only imagine which ones and how bad they are hahaha
9/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: Jajaja pensá que no entiendo lo que estás diciendo
9/5/20 20:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 20:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 20:45 - Joe: HaHahahahah I can feel you judging me from across the planet 😂
9/5/20 20:48 - Joe: Good thing there are no spanish subtitles hahah
9/5/20 20:50 - Joe: Oh fuck, YouTube added auto-translate hahahahahaha
9/5/20 20:59 - Joe: Ok, time to go skate. Hit me up later. 

Don’t find anything else of me on the internet while I’m out
9/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: La compañera, la loca....me pilló para hablar y no me dejaba en paz, que pesada!!!!
9/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: Jajajajaja es mi momento
9/5/20 21:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 21:49 - Lorena: Buena idea 😈
9/5/20 22:01 - Lorena: No es verdad! 😂😂🤗🤗
9/5/20 22:05 - Joe: Haha that sucks! 

Sorry, I just got back from my short skate not too long ago and I was in the shower 🚿
9/5/20 22:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: Jajajjajajaja
9/5/20 22:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: I have put Joe and you already appear in my YouTube search engine the first haha
9/5/20 22:11 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂 whyyyyyyyyy
9/5/20 22:12 - Joe: Lots of Joe Villavicencio content on YouTube haha I can’t believe I ever get jobs 😂
9/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: Jijiji your family is fan of the paddington bear
9/5/20 22:19 - Joe: Haha she knows I have the paddington tattoo so that’s probably why.


But it is a Peruvian bear that goes to England so it’s definitely got some family meaning to it for me. 

People always think it’s weird when they see I have a paddington tattoo until I explain that part to them 😂
9/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: jajaja si, para mi era extraño también, hasta que me lo explicaste, y todo tiene sentido!
9/5/20 22:24 - Lorena: ohhh... oh... jaja acabo de darme cuenta que hay dos cuentas de Youtube con tu nombre
9/5/20 22:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:25 - Joe: FUCK
9/5/20 22:26 - Joe: Ok if you found me flying airplanes you might as well see what it looked like when I got really good at it hahaha
9/5/20 22:26 - Joe: I was sponsored and this dude gave me free airplanes to fly 😂 

https://youtu.be/kcLqWzNJFXM
9/5/20 22:27 - Joe: I only got into it because I hurt my ankle so bad skating that I couldn’t really skate for almost a year. DONT JUDGE ME!!!!!
9/5/20 22:27 - Joe: I needed something to do hahah oh fuck me god dammit
9/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: JAJAJAJAJA
9/5/20 22:29 - Lorena: Sorry, but it amuses me. Whenever I see some boy or old man with a boat or plane, I laugh a little
9/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Ok I’m going to go die of shame now, thanks hahahahaha
9/5/20 22:31 - Lorena: I remember that once in a job, we sold many decoration products, and one of them was a helicopter but it worked well, and it became a top seller. haha many boys came to buy it, in the end they gave us one, I went to try it in a field, and I stamped it against a curb...
9/5/20 22:31 - Lorena: jajaja noooo, solo estoy bromeando Joe!
9/5/20 22:33 - Lorena: I don't have the experience to give much opinion, but I think it flies well! 🔥🛩️
9/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Haha it felt like skateboarding to me. Trying to make the plane look like it’s doing tricks with style. Making it dance in the sky. Plus it felt like doing flip tricks on a skateboard. Flip the plane fast and try to stop it at the right time and fly away smooth. It was fun 🤷‍♂️
9/5/20 22:35 - Joe: I don’t have planes anymore though haha
9/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: jajaj si parece complicado!! y eso, por que ya no tenés aviones?
9/5/20 22:41 - Joe: Partly because my ankle got better and I could finally skate again....and partly because the dude that was giving me free planes suddenly passes away and that I a CRAZY expensive hobby. Definitely couldn’t have flown those big ones if they weren’t free hahaha
9/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: Why do older people give you marijuana and airplanes? Hahaha
9/5/20 22:43 - Joe: Damn I wish you had something online I could look through 😂 

You’re finding some quality stuff there hahah
9/5/20 22:43 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️
9/5/20 22:44 - Joe: I get free skateboard stuff too hahaha
9/5/20 22:44 - Joe: People like to give me things I guess
9/5/20 22:45 - Lorena: That sounds good! hahaha
9/5/20 22:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:53 - Joe: Just kidding I love the free stuff hahaha
9/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 22:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/5/20 23:12 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
9/5/20 23:41 - Lorena: Tom y Jerry eran mis dibujitos preferidos
9/5/20 23:46 - Joe: Haha saaaaame. Straight classic! 

Sorry I’m distracted by my dumb game again hahah. I’m trying to implement private rooms. I have it working but it’s not secure so I have to completely redo how I handle the password verification.
9/5/20 23:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:10 - Lorena: No worries!  I don't know how much I will endure today.  hahaha dumb game 🙈..in the end you will learn a lot with all its modifications!
10/5/20 0:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:37 - Joe: Hahahahah!!

10/5/20 0:40 - Joe: This is also me hahaha good stuff. I’ll learn more from memes so keep sending them when you find good ones haha
10/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Stop memes hahah
10/5/20 0:54 - Lorena: Did you see any more chapter?
10/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: Stop memes 😂
10/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Hahahaha good memes!
10/5/20 0:58 - Joe: I saw a few more episodes the other day. It’s definitely my favorite show right now. Great recommendation 👍 

It just gets crazier and crazier. I think the last episode I saw was when Nairobi gets shot and the bodyguard guy gets free.
10/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: 😱😱😱
10/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: Ya estás casi en el final, eso es de la última temporada
10/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: Odio al calvo de seguridad es un hijo de puta
10/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Whaaat!? Am I on the last already? I though it was the second to last. Damn. I better slow down haha
10/5/20 1:20 - Joe: Yeah that security dude is an asshole, so is that new dude that was in charge before Tokyo took over. 

It was so wild when they were putting Nairobi to sleep to do surgery and she was like, “no no noooo don’t put me to sleep”. They would’ve felt so bad if she never woke up 😬
10/5/20 6:01 - Lorena: Última temporada, no capítulo jjj
10/5/20 6:02 - Lorena: No puedo creer, me acabo de depertar a esta hora ...mierda
10/5/20 6:03 - Joe: Hahaha go back to sleep. Too early for you
10/5/20 6:04 - Lorena: No puedo! Llevo un rato en la cama diciendo no, no.. seguí con los ojos cerrados
10/5/20 6:05 - Joe: Oh I know that feeling 😂
10/5/20 6:06 - Joe: I just watched some more and uuuuh Nairobi is dead 😢
10/5/20 6:06 - Lorena: Ohhhhhh
10/5/20 6:06 - Joe: She was my favorite dammit
10/5/20 6:07 - Lorena: Que hijo de puta eh? Da mucha rabia ... Un tiro en la cabeza
10/5/20 6:07 - Joe: While talking shit too. Ugh damn
10/5/20 6:08 - Lorena: Ohhh !!! Ella es genial, su acento y carácter, muy divertidaa
10/5/20 6:08 - Joe: And they get you all hyped up cause she trying to make babies haha
10/5/20 6:08 - Joe: Hell yeah she was tiiiiiight
10/5/20 6:08 - Lorena: Si, si... Muy sucio ese juego
10/5/20 6:09 - Lorena: Jajaj si me reí mucho cuando intenta convencer al profesor para que sea el padre de sus hijos
10/5/20 6:11 - Joe: Haha me too. That shit was hella funny. Bogota was about to seal the deal instead though 😂
10/5/20 6:11 - Joe: But then she died 😔
10/5/20 6:12 - Joe: Now I don’t like your recommendation anymore. How could they kill Nairobi!?
10/5/20 6:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:12 - Lorena: Jajajjajajaja
10/5/20 6:14 - Lorena: A mí no me gustó... pero tenía que pasar.. todo lo que pasa luego es mejor
10/5/20 6:15 - Lorena: El profesor toma decisiones, hacen equipo y dan ganas de venganza jaja
10/5/20 6:18 - Lorena: Me gusta mucho el personaje de Palermo....es un hijo de puta pero luego él se enoja mucho cuando matan a Nairobi... Parece más humano y muy decidido a matar al calvo
10/5/20 6:21 - Joe: Haha I’m on the fence with Palermo. He was upset when she died..but she wouldn’t have died at all if it wasn’t for him. 


I guess I like how eccentric that character is 🤷‍♂️
10/5/20 6:21 - Joe: And good, I’m trying to see some revenge go down
10/5/20 6:25 - Lorena: Síii, jaja y que palabras o frases aprendiste en la serie? Te escucho👂
10/5/20 6:27 - Joe: Hahaha damn
10/5/20 6:27 - Joe: Oh I know hahahah
10/5/20 6:27 - Joe: I learned maricon 😂
10/5/20 6:27 - Lorena: 😂
10/5/20 6:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:28 - Joe: Dude I swear there was something they said when I was watching today, and I thought I would remember and tell you, but now I seriously cannot remember
10/5/20 6:29 - Joe: Hahahah alright alright hahaha
10/5/20 6:29 - Joe: Uuuugh
10/5/20 6:29 - Lorena: Mmm jaja me dejas con la curiosidad
10/5/20 6:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:29 - Lorena: Jajaj bien pronunciado: maricón
10/5/20 6:30 - Joe: Haha really I can’t remember now. It was something they kept saying. Fuck
10/5/20 6:30 - Lorena: Siiiiiguieeeenteee
10/5/20 6:30 - Joe: Haha shit
10/5/20 6:31 - Joe: 🤔 damn I’m really trying to think. Next time I’ll write it down or message you so I don’t forget.
10/5/20 6:31 - Joe: You give me something
10/5/20 6:31 - Joe: To say
10/5/20 6:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:33 - Lorena: 😒
10/5/20 6:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:33 - Lorena: "Estoy indignado con la muerte de Nairobi, era mi personaje preferido"
10/5/20 6:34 - Joe: Haha that’s tough
10/5/20 6:34 - Joe: Ok ok I got this. So good. Right now. Any second haha
10/5/20 6:35 - Joe: Duuude
10/5/20 6:35 - Lorena: 💪💪💪
10/5/20 6:35 - Joe: Hahahaha fuck
10/5/20 6:36 - Joe: Hahah I’m struggling over here
10/5/20 6:37 - Lorena: Jijijiji
10/5/20 6:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:37 - Joe: That was the worst one yet
10/5/20 6:37 - Joe: the worst!!!!!
10/5/20 6:38 - Joe: Hahahahaha
10/5/20 6:38 - Joe: No bueno
10/5/20 6:38 - Lorena: Jajajaja
10/5/20 6:39 - Joe: I couldn’t make it through that one
10/5/20 6:39 - Joe: Hahahah damn
10/5/20 6:39 - Lorena: Muy bien la palabra indignado pensé que saldría peor
10/5/20 6:39 - Lorena: Hay que mejorar personaje, la letra J
10/5/20 6:39 - Lorena: Y preferido
10/5/20 6:41 - Joe: Say just “personaje” so I can hear it better
10/5/20 6:41 - Lorena: Sii, estás cerca. En realidad es difícil... No me di cuenta .. al final consigues darme pena jajaja y digo ay pobre ... 😬
10/5/20 6:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:42 - Joe: Hahah oh yeah I have to work on that for sure. I wasn’t even close
10/5/20 6:43 - Joe: Damn J is hard for me 😂
10/5/20 6:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:44 - Lorena: "La pronunciación" sería como la letra G
10/5/20 6:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:45 - Lorena: Ay que lindooo sunset
10/5/20 6:45 - Lorena: Nunca había visto fotos a esta hora jajaja
10/5/20 6:46 - Joe: Kind of. It’s a little bit of a G mixed with an H
10/5/20 6:48 - Joe: Haha I literally ran out the front door to grab some pictures when I saw the sun setting through the window 😂
10/5/20 6:48 - Joe: Cause I always miss the sunset by a few minutes haha. Not today!
10/5/20 6:50 - Lorena: 🧐
10/5/20 6:52 - Lorena: Jaja re lindo, y que haces en casa?
10/5/20 6:53 - Joe: Hahah I don’t know. But it’s that kind of back of the throat sound you make when you say it that I’m missing even if I technically say it right. It still sounds wrong haha
10/5/20 6:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 6:57 - Joe: Mmmm looks pretty nice there too 🤗
10/5/20 6:59 - Lorena: Me entró hambre al ver esto. 7AM 🤤

10/5/20 7:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:01 - Lorena: Mataría por unas tortitas ahora mismo
10/5/20 7:03 - Lorena: Podrías venir ahora mismo? A mí cocina a hacer las tortitas
10/5/20 7:03 - Joe: Hahaha too bad I can’t make you some. Too far. 


One of these days I’ll make you pancakes!!🥞
10/5/20 7:03 - Lorena: Te podría dejar lugar en mi cama así me haces compañía mientras intento dormirme jajaja
10/5/20 7:03 - Joe: Hahahahaha I wish
10/5/20 7:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:04 - Lorena: Mmmmm jaja así no 😷
10/5/20 7:05 - Lorena: 😂
10/5/20 7:05 - Joe: Hahaha one day, one day. But I’ll be the one making the pancakes, you can wait in the bed 😝
10/5/20 7:07 - Joe: You make me nervous haha. Should I be nervous? You’re trying to lure me into a trap?? With pancakes??
10/5/20 7:07 - Joe: Cause it’s working hahah
10/5/20 7:08 - Lorena: Jajajaja estoy intentando seducirte
10/5/20 7:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:09 - Joe: Hahahahaha what have I gotten myself into???
10/5/20 7:10 - Lorena: Mmm jaja creo que el gato blanco podría ser yo también
10/5/20 7:11 - Joe: 😂 we still don’t know who is trapping who yet
10/5/20 7:11 - Joe: To be continued....
10/5/20 7:12 - Lorena: 🤣🤣🤣
10/5/20 7:16 - Joe: Just let me know when your plan to murder me is ready and I’ll come out to visit you
10/5/20 7:17 - Lorena: Jaja a vos no!
10/5/20 7:19 - Lorena: Si me llegas a visitar no sé si serías tan tímido jaja sí te invito a mi cama
10/5/20 7:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:22 - Joe: Hahahahaha!!!
10/5/20 7:22 - Joe: I think I would be ok 😂
10/5/20 7:23 - Joe: Don’t tease me though hahaha
10/5/20 7:28 - Lorena: 👼
10/5/20 7:28 - Lorena: ???
10/5/20 7:31 - Joe: You tempting me with all this talk of pancakes and pictures from your bed hahaha

Now I suddenly have an urge to go to Madrid for some reason 🤔
10/5/20 7:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:42 - Lorena: Jajaj lo intento pero es difícil contigo
10/5/20 7:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 7:43 - Lorena: Jajaja
10/5/20 7:45 - Lorena: Pregunta, sos cariñoso?
10/5/20 7:47 - Joe: Haha what do you mean by that?
10/5/20 7:48 - Joe: I’m pretty affectionate if I’m comfortable. Very affectionate actually
10/5/20 7:53 - Joe: Hmmm I want to describe what I’m like when I really care about someone but I don’t want to seem weird haha. Fuck. I guess it’s me though


Ok. Only a few people have seen my intimate side but when I care for someone It feels intense for me. I like to spend time or talk with only a few people so they end up being the ones I share everything with. 

I don’t know. At this point I just want to be happy and I want whoever I’m with to be happy.
10/5/20 7:55 - Joe: Hopefully you understand what I’m trying to say and I don’t seem weird hahaha fuck.
10/5/20 7:58 - Joe: Also I’ll lay in bed with you all day long if that’s what you mean hahaha
10/5/20 7:58 - Lorena: Nada raro, de hecho me parece que elegiste muy buenas palabras para describirlo, muy bonita la frase final. Me gusta tu panera de pensar ☺️
10/5/20 7:59 - Joe: Haha thanks. It’s hard to describe stuff like that in a message. 

What about you? Are you very affectionate? What do you like?
10/5/20 7:59 - Lorena: 😳 Is Joe the one who says this? Hahaha
10/5/20 8:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:00 - Lorena: Jajajaja no no otra vez no!!!!!
10/5/20 8:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:05 - Lorena: Mmmm.. ahora entiendo lo rara que es mi pregunta.. 

Pero si, soy cariñosa. Bastante, si me siento cómoda. De hecho comprobé que hay una gran diferencia ... Puedo ser como otra persona si no me gusta realmente alguien, arggg que difícil jaja ...

Tampoco soy una garrapata, jaja no soy de esas que se da mil besos en público, pero si soy cariñosa si un chico me gusta y con los animales
10/5/20 8:06 - Lorena: (bueno con mi familia y amigas también.. jaja pero con chicos y animales más 😅🙈)
10/5/20 8:09 - Joe: Hahah the part about kissing in public is funny. I’m like that. It’s only for me and you 😂 

Yeah i probably didn’t completely understand what you meant by the question so I just explained as much as I can.
10/5/20 8:13 - Joe: I just smoked a little while ago and now you got me thinking super hard about the way I am with other people/people I like haha


Stoned thoughts 💭

10/5/20 8:19 - Lorena: Me encanta lo cariñosa que es Kenya
10/5/20 8:20 - Lorena: hahaha good combination!
10/5/20 8:24 - Joe: You being so far away is a little annoying right now hahaha fuck. I don’t like what you’re doing to me. I’m not supposed to tell anyone anything about me 😂 

I was supposed to be secluded on this island and no one would notice me hahaha
10/5/20 8:25 - Joe: And now I’m telling you about how I would lay in bed with you all day hahah but your bed is too far!!!
10/5/20 8:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:30 - Lorena: Jajaja te fuiste a Hawaii por algún motivo en California?
10/5/20 8:32 - Lorena: marijuana is making you drop words, fine!  hahaha if I would like you to be in my bed, or me in yours.  

Dear unknown, but so the time difference would be solved for example 🙄 hahaha
10/5/20 8:37 - Joe: I just wanted to try living out here. I lived in California all my life. In the Bay Area. There’s so many people there and life is fast paced, everyone trying to hustle and get by cause it’s expensive. I kind of was getting tired of it. 

Island life is slower. Relaxed. Less pressure. Plus it’s beautiful.
10/5/20 8:37 - Joe: Haha one day I swear!
10/5/20 8:44 - Lorena: Buena elección, "pura vida", lo escuchaste alguna vez?
10/5/20 8:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 8:48 - Lorena: haha ok now I'm stopping . I'm a 31 year old adult woman 😒
10/5/20 8:49 - Joe: 😂
10/5/20 8:50 - Joe: No I haven’t heard that before but I like the translation. That’s what I want.
10/5/20 9:02 - Lorena: Pura vida en Costa Rica es un saludo( hola, adiós, como estás, todo bien?) 
 Ellos lo dicen continuamente.. como ahí Aloha por ejemplo...
Costa Rica está entre los países más felices del mundo.. y el significado de "pura vida" es como... vida relajada, energía positiva, sin estrés, disfrutando de la vida
10/5/20 9:08 - Joe: Aah ok I get it. That’s really cool. I should check out Costa Rica. Sounds amazing and like they appreciate the slow life like here. I have to improve my spanish haha. Then we can meet in Costa Rica 😂
10/5/20 9:17 - Lorena: Jajaja
10/5/20 9:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 9:20 - Lorena: Podrías parecer de ahí, no gringo 😂. Todos los ticos llevan pelo largo rizado como vos
10/5/20 9:27 - Joe: Haha looks like a good time
10/5/20 9:27 - Joe: I’ll just have you do all the talking so I can blend in haha
10/5/20 9:34 - Lorena: 😂
10/5/20 9:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 9:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 9:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 9:57 - Joe: What are you about to work on? Breakfast looks good. 

I’m almost finished fixing that security problem with the passwords. Sooo close. I think haha.
10/5/20 10:01 - Lorena: mmm looking at random things like Amazon, Youtube, bikinis, design.. haha
10/5/20 10:02 - Lorena: I'm testing
10/5/20 10:03 - Lorena: it looks good!!
10/5/20 10:04 - Joe: Haha sounds fun. Some morning internet browsing and breakfast ☕️ 🍳 

Testing what?
10/5/20 10:04 - Lorena: what a change the dice game made!
10/5/20 10:04 - Joe: Haha thanks. I made the winner animate in when the game is done too. Thanks for the suggestion haha
10/5/20 10:05 - Joe: Ooh testing my game haha. Cool
10/5/20 10:06 - Lorena: Me hace ilusión ver los cambios, todos los detalles. jaja mientras hablabamos por whatsapp
10/5/20 10:06 - Joe: There are a few things that got messed up like the size and alignment of my buttons but its overall better. 

I don’t know how my buttons moved 😂
10/5/20 10:07 - Joe: My design consultant from Spain
10/5/20 10:07 - Lorena: hiciste más pequeño el logo, queda mejor!
10/5/20 10:09 - Lorena: 🤭
10/5/20 10:09 - Joe: I mean you said it would be better if it was smaller so I tried it out haha
10/5/20 10:09 - Lorena: Video
10/5/20 10:09 - Joe: Video what?
10/5/20 10:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:14 - Joe: Hahaha you can’t help but give more suggestions.
10/5/20 10:15 - Lorena: Jajajaja lo siento lo sientooo
10/5/20 10:15 - Joe: Haha oh I guess I didn’t do it how you imagined. It just comes from the side. I’ll add some falling confetti and make it bounce or something hahaha
10/5/20 10:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:16 - Joe: It needs to be better! Give all the suggestions. I told you I’m terrible at design. I just think it’s funny. You have the eye and you like to do it so you can’t help yourself hahah
10/5/20 10:17 - Lorena: Voy!
10/5/20 10:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:20 - Joe: Sooo winner used to just suddenly appear after every game. Now it slides from the right and the logo moves up. Right?
10/5/20 10:22 - Joe: But like I said I’ll add more animation haha. Confetti and bouncing “winner” or something
10/5/20 10:22 - Lorena: Jajaja es que así se ve toda la info en una pantalla sin quedarse nada oculto abajo.  Si, disfruto de la maquetación y los detalles jjj. 

Si en algún momento te molesta, por favor decimelo!
10/5/20 10:24 - Lorena: Ahhhhh ahora lo ví!
10/5/20 10:24 - Joe: Not even close to being bothered by it
10/5/20 10:25 - Joe: I’ll move everything up a little bit
10/5/20 10:33 - Lorena: siii, simplemente un poquito para que no quede cortado
10/5/20 10:34 - Lorena: Joe, te gusta el diseño/ arquitectura?
10/5/20 10:37 - Joe: I do. Why? I’m not good at design but I’ve been trying to learn. And I appreciate unique architecture when I see it for sure. I used to drive around and just look at houses for no reason hahah
10/5/20 10:39 - Lorena: para mostrarte un video, de mis proyectos preferidos, es un arquitecto español, con una filosofía que me encanta, el trabajó la arquitectura e interiorismo, como un todo.. a mi me encantan los lugares abanonados, por la altura de techos, etc
10/5/20 10:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:40 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIQlWkYijLM
10/5/20 10:41 - Lorena: me parece interesante su filosofía, y lo que el creó hace muchos años.. además así podés escuchar español, el acento es catalán, de Barcelona. Podés poner subtitulos en inglés!
10/5/20 10:42 - Joe: Woooaah that’s fucking awesome haha
10/5/20 10:43 - Lorena: Sorry, I meant you had the subtitles below to understand it
10/5/20 10:43 - Joe: Haha alright I’m about to check out this video
10/5/20 10:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 10:51 - Joe: Holy shit hahah that’s tight
10/5/20 10:53 - Joe: He definitely seems like a super interesting dude. I love how that building turned out. So cool looking
10/5/20 10:59 - Lorena: Si, es increíble. Me encantaría vivir ahí!
10/5/20 15:06 - Joe: Sorry I fell asleep out of nowhere on the couch 😐 I just woke up not knowing where the hell I was at hahaha. 

Anyway, that dudes work is awesome and you should send me more stuff that you like when can. 

I’m going to try to go back to sleep now. Too early haha. Talk to you later. Un beso
10/5/20 15:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 20:58 - Joe: Hola! I’m finally alive
10/5/20 23:11 - Lorena: Buenos días dormilón, que tal?
10/5/20 23:14 - Lorena: Yo salí a dar un paseo, y ahora justo terminé de cenar!
10/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/5/20 23:25 - Joe: Hahaha sounds like a nice evening over there 😂
10/5/20 23:26 - Joe: I’m alright. Just doing some work given to me by this web designer girl from Spain haha
11/5/20 0:07 - Lorena: Jajaja muy bien, esto me parece increíble jaja
11/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:13 - Joe: Hahah ok I am pushing the updates to the website now 😂
11/5/20 0:26 - Lorena: Voy a verlo
11/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: Lo cambiaste no?
11/5/20 0:32 - Joe: Hahaha thanks! I just did what you suggested. Definitely gives the site a better look/feel
11/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:34 - Joe: Yeah I didn’t like the way the dice would move all over the place after you pick one. Sometime it would make you choose the wrong dice because they’d move after you pick one up. Now they animate off the screen after you pick one but the remaining dice stay still
11/5/20 0:34 - Lorena: Jaja sí, entre los dos fuimos dando un poco más de forma al original jaja recuerdo todavía como era jaja creo que tenemos una foto
11/5/20 0:35 - Lorena: if it is true, good change!
11/5/20 0:35 - Joe: Haha let me see the photo. It was butt ugly when I first showed you 😂
11/5/20 0:36 - Joe: Gracias 🙃
11/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: Pero se puede elegir más de uno en la misma partida, eso también lo cambiaste no?
11/5/20 0:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:37 - Joe: 🤔 no I don’t think I changed anything like that. You could always pick up one or more after each roll
11/5/20 0:38 - Joe: Hah yesssss. Small details haha
11/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Mmmm a ver
11/5/20 0:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: Jajajjaja
11/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: Que bueno
11/5/20 0:43 - Lorena: De esta no me acordaba!!!!😲
11/5/20 0:47 - Joe: Hahaha too many cervezas?? 😂
11/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: Jajaja no, solo una!
11/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: Digo que no recordaba que la de página de inicio
11/5/20 0:48 - Joe: Extra large one haha
11/5/20 0:48 - Joe: Hahah for sure. I’m just kidding. I barely remember it either!
11/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:50 - Joe: Hahaha just a liiiittle better
11/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Jjjjj, yo me acuerdo de tu emoción mostrandomelo por primera vez
11/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Three......oneee.....twooo....
11/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: Jajajaja
11/5/20 0:51 - Joe: Hahaha I got way too into making this game. It’s been really good practice though. I’ve learned about a bunch of stuff I’ve never used before to make this one.
11/5/20 0:52 - Joe: Very fun but also frustrating at times haha
11/5/20 0:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 0:54 - Lorena: que feo gifffff, jaja -1 punto!!
11/5/20 0:55 - Joe: fine whatever hahahahaha
11/5/20 0:58 - Lorena: if in the end, you spent hours, and greatly improved the changes. Although I know you were frustrated at times, I am so glad you are at this point!
11/5/20 1:00 - Joe: The funny thing is I was going to stop at the point where it worked. I just wanted to play with my friends. 

But then they asked if I could make the dice look like dice. And the one friend asked if he could draw a logo. And you started making suggestions. Team effort hahah
11/5/20 1:01 - Joe: Most features were requested by others. I just built it haha
11/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: I love that team, haha ​​what a good unknown friend! now you can play better with your friends!
11/5/20 1:09 - Joe: Yeah now I just need to come up with more ideas that they like so they’ll help me with ideas haha


Right now I’m trying to build a generic e-commerce site so they can all just drop in their art or clothing they want to sell and some images and have a working site. That’s been going a lot slower haha
11/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Me había quedado dormida! Jaja acabo de abrir los ojos
11/5/20 1:49 - Joe: Haha that’s ok it’s late there. You probably have the course tomorrow too. You should get some rest
11/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Mm quiero verla luego esa web?
11/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Mmm
11/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Haha I’ll show you eventually. It’s supposed to be very minimal. Just enough to sell some items
11/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Hahaha
11/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Mmmm
11/5/20 1:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 1:51 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 1:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: 🙌 eh ahora sii!!
11/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: Creo que ya no se me ocurren más cambios jaja 🤔 bueno dos aún pendientes! Jaja
11/5/20 1:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 1:57 - Joe: So when I find out summer camp is canceled....what do you want to do??
11/5/20 2:01 - Lorena: just kidding? Hahaha
11/5/20 2:02 - Joe: Uuuuuuh suuuure if you want me to be just kidding 😬
11/5/20 2:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:05 - Lorena: hahaha I'm asleep and could imagine various things. So tell us, what would we do?
11/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Well...it depends. Are you tied down in Madrid? I could go anywhere really 🤷‍♂️
11/5/20 2:09 - Joe: Also depends on what you’d want. Would you want to meet me for a short while like a a few weeks or longer or shorter? Or not at all hahaha

I have no reason to be in any place in particular so I can do whatever you like
11/5/20 2:10 - Joe: I’ll get those cool new headphones with the built in translator 😂 😂
11/5/20 2:12 - Joe: Or you can just meet me back in Hawaii after summer haha
11/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: I was in shock, hahaha a few seconds but with a smile on my face
11/5/20 2:19 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t know...like you said, you’re a 31 year old woman...and I’m a 30 year old man. 

We can do whatever we want with our lives. But you it’s up to you. I’ll be ok with getting lost in the anywhere in the world with you.
11/5/20 2:19 - Joe: Sounds fun
11/5/20 2:21 - Joe: Haha sorry maybe you should sleep on it and answer later
11/5/20 2:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:26 - Lorena: I think I could fall asleep, but with this my eyes are now super open! hahaha
11/5/20 2:28 - Lorena: I'm not tied to Madrid, in fact I want to travel and learn English!
11/5/20 2:29 - Lorena: although I think you could also buy me the translator headset hahah
11/5/20 2:29 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what you expected when you’re trying to lure me in 😂 


But yeah no pressure to answer now. Just think about it
11/5/20 2:31 - Joe: It was hard to ask haha. I’ve been thinking about it recently though and I don’t see why not. Am I just going to message you on WhatsApp forever? Or ask you to go on an adventure?
11/5/20 2:31 - Lorena: suena genial Joe, jaja me pongo nerviosa ...ahora soy yo.. jajaja
11/5/20 2:33 - Joe: Take your time. And I won’t be crushed if you say no. But I would love if you said yes. I understand it’s kind of crazy.
11/5/20 2:34 - Joe: Seriously...answer in a day or two. Or a week or a month. When you’re ready. But think about it
11/5/20 2:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:37 - Joe: Hahahah fuck yeah. We’ll get you there. That’s no problem at all.
11/5/20 2:39 - Joe: Looks like Hawaii hahaha. Gives you plenty of time to change your mind. I’m excited though
11/5/20 2:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:41 - Joe: Sorry if I woke you with my question hahaha
11/5/20 2:44 - Lorena: are you as crazy as me ???haha I didn't t expect this question ... I will adopt the Hawaii schedule, how can I sleep today? hahaha I smoked and this is not real?
11/5/20 2:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:46 - Joe: Hahahahaha!!
11/5/20 2:47 - Joe: Honestly this would be the craziest thing I’ve ever done haha

I hope you’re not too crazy and I’m getting myself into trouble here 😂
11/5/20 2:50 - Joe: Is there anything I should know now? Hahaha

Now you make me nervous 🤔
11/5/20 2:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:51 - Lorena: hahaha no, I told you everything from the beginning that I started talking to you!
11/5/20 2:53 - Joe: Alright alright. Well i guess you should start working on your English in that case haha.
11/5/20 2:56 - Joe: If you change your mind when you aren’t so stoned let me know 😂 

Even though I joke around, I took asking you about this seriously. If you knew me for a long time you would not expect anything like this from me at all. I didn’t expect it sooo i don’t know.
11/5/20 2:56 - Joe: Go to sleep hahaha
11/5/20 2:57 - Lorena: no puedo dormirrrrrrrr
11/5/20 2:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 2:59 - Joe: Hahahaha
11/5/20 2:59 - Joe: I’m sorry! I should’ve asked at a better time. I forget about the time difference haha
11/5/20 3:00 - Lorena: I'm not going to change my mind haha, you said I was going to get tired and I was going to stop talking to you 2 days and look ...
11/5/20 3:02 - Joe: That’s true. I’m shocked
11/5/20 3:06 - Lorena: jaja pero en que momento pensaste esto? no imaginaba ni por un segundo que te lo hubieses planteado... lo comentaste con alguien??
11/5/20 3:07 - Lorena: yo por un momento pensaba ir a california a la granja de marihuana asi podía verte jajaja
11/5/20 3:08 - Joe: Mmmm no I haven’t talked about it with anyone. It was probably about a week ago when I started considering it. When I realized I wake up and send you a message. Like i told you, i don’t talk to people. I’m fine with going long periods of time without talking and being comfortable with it. But I really like to talk to you
11/5/20 3:09 - Joe: Haha hey that’s always an option too 😂 you probably like the island better though.
11/5/20 3:14 - Joe: You have an attitude about life that I like. I like that you are outgoing and reached out to me in the first place. It’s like to tell you things or joke with you in ways that I’m sure are going to make you stop talking to me but you don’t. You seem fun. Lighthearted. I’m down for that
11/5/20 3:18 - Lorena: jaja esto es algo que me cuesta imaginar, que no hables con la gente...conmigo hablas mucho! desde el día que te hablé, hablamos todos los días, excepto un día! jaja
11/5/20 3:19 - Lorena: Segurooo, pero yo no sé si podría entrar en Estados Unidos, Trump... seguro pone problemas con la visa para Uruguay!
11/5/20 3:20 - Joe: Fuck my life 🤦‍♂️
11/5/20 3:21 - Joe: Well if you can’t come here. We can go somewhere else haha.
11/5/20 3:25 - Lorena: Ohhh gracias! jjj a mi me gusta tu forma de ser, muy reservado y tímido al principio... eso consiguió que me interese más por vos... y hablamos muchas horas, siento que puedo compartirte cualquier cosa, intentas entenderme e interesarte!
11/5/20 3:27 - Lorena: mmmm no entiendo, por que pénsas que iba a dejar de hablarte por bromas o algo así? a mi me gustas así!
11/5/20 3:28 - Joe: Yeah you slowly pulled me out of my shell. You can definitely tell me anything. I’d like to know more but I never know what to ask haha
11/5/20 3:30 - Joe: Haha damn I am keeping you up all night tonight. Whoops 😬
11/5/20 3:35 - Lorena: jajaja si, lentamente... duro trabajo! jajaja te intentaba sacar algunas palabras más, pero siempre eras muy educado jajaja pero me das los buenos días casi todos los días, entonces eso hizo que siga intentandolo jajaja
11/5/20 3:37 - Lorena: Yes I hate you. I never have sleep problemsssss hahaha today I woke up at 6am and spoke with you, and now it's almost 4 and I don't see sleeping easily. hahaha thank goodness I took a nap today, while you establish sleeping in your night.
11/5/20 3:37 - Joe: Hahahahaha
11/5/20 3:38 - Joe: In a few months, all our time difference problems can be solved hopefully
11/5/20 3:39 - Joe: Good thing you kept trying haha
11/5/20 3:41 - Lorena: jajaja okey, creo que voy a intentar dormirme, mañana me tendré que inyectar el café jajaja
11/5/20 3:42 - Lorena: pero mereció la pena, gracias por contarme todo lo que pensabas!!
11/5/20 3:43 - Joe: Hahaha ok ok sounds good. No problem. I had fun telling it all.

11/5/20 3:47 - Lorena: sii era una bromaaaa todo esto, dejame un mensaje y lo leere mañana! jajaaj
11/5/20 3:50 - Joe: No joke. No seré pinocho haha. Sleep well

11/5/20 20:24 - Joe: Hahah I’ll practice that one today
11/5/20 20:24 - Joe: You can get a better one tomorrow 😂
11/5/20 20:25 - Joe: Necesito más tiempo hahah

11/5/20 20:29 - Joe: Hahahah
11/5/20 20:29 - Joe: Well it’s funny how you say my name too hahaha 😂
11/5/20 20:30 - Joe: My natural instinct is to say it like Lore kind of like Lorie or Lor
11/5/20 20:31 - Joe: But you say it like in between those two haha
11/5/20 20:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:36 - Lorena: Joe, repetilo en inglés así intento pronunciarlo, jaja
11/5/20 20:36 - Joe: Haha that makes sense. If I think of it that way I’ll get it down fast 😂
11/5/20 20:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:38 - Joe: Sorry sound is bad. I’m out down the street by the beach 😂
11/5/20 20:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: jajaja ruido, pero escuché!
11/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: Joseph?
11/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: Joe, hooonee!
11/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Just pretend you’re a total skater bro from California when you say it and it’ll come out right hahaha
11/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Hooone hahaha
11/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Had to throw that in there

11/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: si querés que lo diga, tendrás que repetirme la frase completa en inglés jajaja
11/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: ayyy, clase de inglés/español en la playa!!! jajaja
11/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Hahah ok ok. Short and easy one. “Hi Joe, nice to meet you”
11/5/20 20:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:44 - Joe: The best!
11/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: bah eso es muy aburrido
11/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: jajajaj
11/5/20 20:46 - Joe: Hahahahaha ok a better one.
11/5/20 20:46 - Joe: “Shut the fuck up Joe” 😂
11/5/20 20:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:47 - Joe: You’ll need that one
11/5/20 20:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:51 - Lorena: Iba a decir Joe con mi acento jfkfnfjsins
11/5/20 20:53 - Joe: Hahaha I could tell. Next tine day it like your mad 😂 Like you’re telling me “cállate carajo” 😡
11/5/20 20:53 - Joe: Next time*
11/5/20 20:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 20:57 - Lorena: DIOS QUE AGUA!
11/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: take a baaath! I want to see thatttt!
11/5/20 21:01 - Joe: 😂 😂 next time. I didn’t bring my backpack with my towel and shit. I’m just chillin here for a second. Still on the morning skate haha
11/5/20 21:02 - Lorena: jajaja bañate desnudo y secate al sol
11/5/20 21:03 - Joe: 🤣 I don’t think they allow that at this beach ahahaha
11/5/20 21:06 - Lorena: haha I do allow it!😇
11/5/20 21:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 21:08 - Joe: Hahahaha!!
11/5/20 21:11 - Joe: You’re trying to get me in trouble haha
11/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: maybeee....
11/5/20 21:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 21:27 - Lorena: 🤢
11/5/20 21:27 - Joe: 😂 🤷‍♂️
11/5/20 21:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 21:28 - Joe: “Live aloha”
11/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: 💭 alohaaa
11/5/20 21:32 - Joe: You should just skip proper English and learn pidgin like the real Hawaiians haha
11/5/20 21:33 - Joe: https://youtu.be/GLmfQSR3EI0
11/5/20 21:38 - Joe: I don’t understand half of what that chick is saying so it’s probably a bunch of nonsense to you ahaha
11/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: Jajaj habla muy rápido 🤯
11/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: Menos mal
11/5/20 21:38 - Joe: Yeah and a lot of the words aren’t even English
11/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: Estaba empezando a deprimirme
11/5/20 21:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/5/20 21:42 - Joe: 😂 didn’t expect that when I started the gif hahaha
11/5/20 21:46 - Lorena: Jaja exacto a el momento que intenté entender el video que me enviaste
11/5/20 21:52 - Joe: Hahah yeah it’s a little much. I’m still trying to understand it completely. My cousins talk like that sometimes so I get to practice often
11/5/20 22:17 - Lorena: jjj este es tu año de los idiomas!
11/5/20 22:22 - Joe: Hahah hopefully it doesn’t turn into some weird mixture of them all where I’m getting all of the  languages wrong 😆
11/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: haha don't think negativeee, it will take time to understand them ... you know that I will help you with Spanish, and you will learn much more than when you were little! 😅
11/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Haha I know I know. I’m pretty determined to learn this time. Honestly I wasn’t taught much when I was little, only by my grandparents. My dad didn’t teach me anything and my mom only speaks English. 

Then when I took spanish classes in high school i resented he fact that I didn’t already speak Spanish and didn’t really want to put in the effort to learn at that point. It was almost embarrassing to try since I felt like I should already know it. 

But I’m over that hahah. I’m down to start from the bottom and feel like a dummy until I understand.
12/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Ey estaba cenando!
12/5/20 0:26 - Joe: No hay problema. Cómo estuvo la cena?
12/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Bien con Sandra, que está pasando por un momento complicado... Hace dos días la mujer de su hermano se volvió loca y lo denuncio por una discusión, y durmió toda la noche en la cárcel... Y tienen un hijo en común.. la chica se inventó cosas para hacerle daño y es todo mentira, una hija de puta
12/5/20 0:43 - Lorena: tu papá habla español entonces? jaja a mi me pasa un poco igual, mi madre habla inglés, siempre le gustó y da clases también, pero a mi de pequeña no me interesó y ahora me arrepiento.. jaja pero bueno, ahora tenemos interés y ganas de aprender, y si nos esforzamos, seguramente en unos años podremos comunicarnos bien! jajaja
12/5/20 0:45 - Joe: Damn sound like a tough situation. That’s rough.
12/5/20 0:48 - Joe: Haha I think my dad grew up in the US in a time where speaking Spanish wasn’t really popular. I don’t know, my grandma always told me he was embarrassed when she would speak Spanish to him in front of his friends when he was younger. He would tell her to speak English to him haha. I think he just wanted to be super American or something 🤷‍♂️
12/5/20 0:48 - Joe: But he speaks Spanish great. I’ll embarrass the fuck out of myself if I try to speak to him in Spanish hahaha
12/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: si, una mierda... yo intentó animarla, le cocinó, invitó a cerveza, hablamos, ahora parece que esta mejor, su hermano tiene un abogado.
12/5/20 0:52 - Lorena: ohh what a shame, if I can imagine ...
12/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: nunca te habla español? si el escucha, que estas hablando alguna palabra de español, se sorprendería? o con el hablas un poco?
12/5/20 0:55 - Joe: Nope, never. 

He would probably just laugh and correct whatever I say wrong or respond with so much I won’t understand all of it. Just my guess though hahah.
12/5/20 0:57 - Joe: I probably wouldn’t even try to talk to him in spanish until I’ve felt confident in my ability for years hahaha. Not even going to do it. I don’t show him much of what I do 😂
12/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: ohhh por que no? el no te va a juzgar, seguro se alegra de que estes aprendiendo español, incluso hacerle gracia que estes viendo una serie en versión original
12/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: Si algún día voy a California...y conozco a tu padre por casualidad, podré hablar con el español!!!!! jajaja
12/5/20 1:02 - Joe: Hahah yeah I guess he’d be happy. He would probably say something like, “you can get paid more now because you speak two languages” haha. Fucking dads 😂
12/5/20 1:02 - Joe: Oh god Hahahaha
12/5/20 1:04 - Joe: My dad would probably say so much shit to embarrass me knowing I won’t understand half of what he is telling you hahaha fuuuck
12/5/20 1:04 - Joe: I better learn quick
12/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: Is right! my mother always told me. We will also say it in the future! Hahaha
12/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 1:09 - Joe: 😂
12/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: jajaja sería gracioso, yo me uniría a el!
12/5/20 1:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 1:15 - Joe: I’m sorry but you’re a web designer now hahaha 

But when this one is done if you have some random shit you want to sell online let me know.
12/5/20 1:16 - Joe: And you don’t really have to give me tips. I’m just working on this right now and wanted to show you 👨‍💻
12/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: jajaja Joe, si yo no tengo ni idea. pero casi siempre me gusta opinar.. cuando hay algo relacionado con tema gráfico jajaja, tengo que hacer algún curso
12/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: esa es la web que estas haciendo para tu amigo no? tiene buena pinta, pasame el link
12/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: jajaja gracias, si vendo algo en algún momento, y necesito una web, te avisaré para que me ayudes!! jjjj
12/5/20 1:21 - Joe: Haha if you have an eye for what looks good in a room or on a wall, it’s very similar. It’s mostly about placement and relationships between the items on the screen to create the feeling you want. Drawing the eye to the important details and making the less important things a little more subtle, but still there and easy to read.
12/5/20 1:22 - Joe: Haha no link yet. It’s only on my computer for now.
12/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: Hey you! my job is not just a room or a wall hahaha. It is not only the aesthetic, but also the functional, it is what I like about interior design. I want to learn web also now that I met you hahaha. but codes nothing!
12/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: me gusta el diseño, las dos franjas negras, y los rectángulos de las fotos!
12/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: lo hiciste vos el diseño también? cuanto tiempo llevas haciendo esta web? fue muy rápido, no?
12/5/20 1:28 - Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. I know it’s more than that and I hope you explain in more detail when you can. I want to hear more about it!
12/5/20 1:29 - Lorena: jajaja todo bien.. bromeaba.. no me ofendí. No pasa nada!
12/5/20 1:29 - Joe: I was working on this for a month already before I started my dice game. I’ve been working slowly on this though cause no one I know needs it haha. Less motivation.
12/5/20 1:31 - Joe: Haha alright for sure. You can still teach me the basics so I know more what it’s about
12/5/20 1:32 - Lorena: menos motivación en la web? no la conoce mucha gente? parece linda la ropa
12/5/20 1:32 - Lorena: mmmmmmmm
12/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: el diseño de interiores tiene varias fases, te pueden contratar para hoteles, viviendas, espacios comerciales, etc... puede ser solo un proyecto de distribución, donde debes decidir la división de las estancias, tabiques, para aprovechar más luz, o que sean más útiles, etc ... eso se presenta con unos planos
12/5/20 1:38 - Joe: Haha yeah these are all just “stock” images from the web I used to make the layout. It’s just a fake store for now.
12/5/20 1:39 - Joe: I did the design but it’s just super basic so it was easier. Just keep it to rectangular shapes and make the items in a grid. I just need to work on the buttons and the checkout process then it’s ready for real items.
12/5/20 1:40 - Joe: Ok ok. These are the 2D plans? Then later you can make a badass 3D model with lighting and all the good shit??
12/5/20 1:41 - Joe: Ooooh I can’t wait until you can make a whole tiny house in 3D. You can build your dream house and show it to me hahaha
12/5/20 1:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 1:41 - Joe: Then maybe I can build it 😂
12/5/20 1:42 - Lorena: si, exacto jajaja..
12/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 1:55 - Lorena: siiiii, cuando haga el curso de 3d, quiero probar a hacer la casa de mis sueños jajaja
12/5/20 1:57 - Joe: Haha I would be just as bad at doing that layout as I am at web design 😂 

Looks like you know what you’re doing though haha
12/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: I would like to have a large lot and a small house. A lot of grass to live with dogs ... I prefer something like that away from the city ... and not living in an apartment without a patio, locked..
12/5/20 1:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: y vos, cómo sería tu sueño de casa o donde?
12/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: jajaja gracias, no sos malo.. lo único tenés que observar más y animarte a diseñar!
12/5/20 1:59 - Joe: You described what I want perfectly
12/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: Sorry, I was shooting the video and I couldn't answer this!
12/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: mmmmm a mi me gusta!!! esta limpio, ordenado, dan ganas de comprar.... jjjj
12/5/20 2:01 - Joe: I’m working on it. I’ve been paying attention to detail more in things like advertisements and other websites. Also subscribed to a bunch of web design YouTube channels recently haha
12/5/20 2:02 - Joe: Haha cool! Now I just need some real items. I guess I could always find something to sell and do it myself 😂
12/5/20 2:02 - Lorena: genial!! yo miro estas páginas.. para inspirarme en las presentaciones
12/5/20 2:02 - Lorena: https://www.behance.net/
12/5/20 2:02 - Lorena: https://issuu.com/
12/5/20 2:03 - Joe: https://dribbble.com
12/5/20 2:03 - Joe: Hahaha I’ve been looking at this one lately
12/5/20 2:04 - Joe: The more resources the better. I drown myself in information and just pick up bits and pieces to learn haha
12/5/20 2:05 - Joe: What’s the second link?
12/5/20 2:05 - Joe: Oh never mind. Just had to read it duh haha
12/5/20 2:06 - Lorena: jaja a mi también me pasa, asi que lo que hice, fue abrir un archivo nuevo de powerpoint... y copio las imágenes... de tipografías que me gustan, gamas de colores, distribución de fotos, asi que igual te parece útil, es como tener en un documento recopilación de varias fotos, o trozos que te gusten
12/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: I didn't know this page, I keep it!
12/5/20 2:09 - Lorena: Yes, I passed them to you because they can still be used for the designs you make
12/5/20 2:10 - Joe: That’s smart. I started by righting down color pallets i found online in my notebook hahaha. Like a caveman
12/5/20 2:11 - Joe: Haha cool glad I could give you some design resources you haven’t seen before.
12/5/20 2:11 - Lorena: jajajaajajaja
12/5/20 2:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: Powerpoint es fácil, copia y pega!
12/5/20 2:13 - Joe: I don’t think I’ve ever used PowerPoint to be honest haha I’ll try it if it helps
12/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: 😂 vosss!
12/5/20 2:15 - Lorena: really? but it is super basic, how did you deliver the work or presentations in class? hahah
12/5/20 2:16 - Joe: 🤔 last time I had to do a presentation I used this thing called Prezi

I didn’t take classes for web development though. I just learned it online.
12/5/20 2:18 - Lorena: jaja si Prezi. Pero Power Point, es como Paint, Excel, Word, programas que ya vienen en los ordenadores, son super faciles y útiles!
12/5/20 2:21 - Joe: Aaah ok ok. I’ll check it out. Add it to the workflow haha. Better than the notebook for sure 😂
12/5/20 2:22 - Joe: 😂 basically
12/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 2:24 - Lorena: jaja te mandé un video!
12/5/20 2:25 - Lorena: que mala soy grabando con una mano jajajaja, mierda
12/5/20 2:26 - Joe: Damn super simple haha. Alright alright I’ll use it
12/5/20 2:28 - Joe: Lol it’s ok I can see it fine. I should’ve known about this a long time ago. I probably would’ve saved way more content that I’ve just forgotten about
12/5/20 2:30 - Lorena: jaja claro, yo guardaba en carpetas, pero muchas veces las imagenes completas no me interesaban, solo una tipografía, entonces en powerpoint, recortó lo que me interesa, o la imagen completa, y cada día voy añadiendo nuevas diapositivas.. no tiene orden, solo copio y pego para luego poder revisarlo, no esta super ordenado...
12/5/20 2:31 - Lorena: haha I think I'm getting bored talking about design, and various things about programs. I find it hard to stop. hahaha but I like to recommend things
12/5/20 2:32 - Joe: Sounds perfect to me. My notes are always a scattered mess hahah
12/5/20 2:32 - Lorena: "I think I'm boring you talking about....bblabala" creo que antes hizo mala traducción
12/5/20 2:32 - Joe: You’re getting bored talking about it? Or not getting bored? Hahah
12/5/20 2:33 - Joe: Oh ok hahah no not at all
12/5/20 2:34 - Joe: Yeah it was a bad translation. I was worried for a second hahah. Thought I was boring you. But no, these are the things I’m interested in so you’re not boring me even a little
12/5/20 2:36 - Lorena: jaja si me di cuenta rápido, por eso volví a ponerlo... me fio muchas veces d google, y luego tiene el significado contrario a lo que quiero decir!!! 😣
12/5/20 2:38 - Joe: no worries. I knew it was a bad translation because you said you, “find it hard to stop”. Wouldn’t be hard if it was boring hahah
12/5/20 2:40 - Joe: Do you always stay up so late? You’re a night owl haha. You even eat dinner pretty late.
12/5/20 2:41 - Lorena: jaja la verdad es que no me acuesto demasiado tarde
12/5/20 2:41 - Lorena: esto esta pasando solo en la cuarentena, siento que no soy productiva 100% durante el día, entonces intento como hacer más cosas y no me doy cuenta de la hora
12/5/20 2:42 - Lorena: como al día siguiente no tengo que ir a trabajar, solo estoy en casa con el curso, tampoco me preocupa demasiado acostarme tarde
12/5/20 2:43 - Lorena: ahora estaba mirando una página que me gusta mucho, me apunté a un curso de marketing digital, para instagram y son videos muy cortos.... aunque tengo que reconocer, que si me quedo muchas veces más tarde de lo normal, no es solo por la cuarentena, es por que hablo con vos
12/5/20 2:44 - Joe: Aaaah ok that makes sense. I stay up super late sometimes like I said before but I think more often I fall asleep early. At least compared to the schedule you’re on right now haha. I only get on the late night schedule when I have a project that I’m working on and need to get the ideas out before I forget 😂
12/5/20 2:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 2:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 2:49 - Lorena: Haha I look silly, I know...thanks!
12/5/20 2:49 - Joe: Haha no you don’t!
12/5/20 2:50 - Joe: I enjoy our time talking. It’s hard with the time difference. Either you have to stay up late or I have to get up early. I appreciate you staying awake longer for me.
12/5/20 2:53 - Joe: If you think staying up late to talk to me makes you look silly....how are you going to look when you go halfway around the world to meet me? Hahahah
12/5/20 2:53 - Joe: Just kidding....don’t change your mind 😂 😂 😂
12/5/20 2:54 - Lorena: 😮😮😮
12/5/20 2:55 - Lorena: si, suuuuuuper tonta, tenés razón! jaja será mejor que busque algo más cercaa!
12/5/20 2:57 - Lorena: aunque no estaba seguro el lugar de encuentro... jaja a lo mejor sos vos el que tenías que venir acá!
12/5/20 3:02 - Joe: If you can’t come to Hawaii I’ll gladly meet you anywhere in the world.

We can plan more details when you’re feeling ready haha. Maybe it’ll be easier to figure out as the world opens up more.
12/5/20 3:08 - Lorena: haha yes, everything is super uncertain with this pandemic!
12/5/20 3:10 - Lorena: the silly girl is going to sleep! haha enjoy the day!!  😘
12/5/20 3:10 - Joe: Ooook. Sleep well. Buenas noches 😘
12/5/20 3:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 3:13 - Lorena: Jjjjjj ☺️
12/5/20 20:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: Buenos días, haha good kicking, how did you sleep?
12/5/20 21:04 - Joe: Pretty good. I feel super tired though. Making extra strong coffee right now.
12/5/20 21:06 - Joe: Cómo estuvo tu día?
12/5/20 21:09 - Lorena: Did you go to bed too late? Haha
12/5/20 21:10 - Lorena: mmm... poco productiva la mañana... Sandra sigue mal, entonces cuando nos ponemos con el curso... no esta centrada... 😕 y tengo que consolarla..
12/5/20 21:11 - Lorena: mi intención hoy era hacer dos entregas, pero la puta planta no consiguió la nota mínima y tuve que arreglarla... jaja odio esa planta!
12/5/20 21:15 - Joe: Mm I guess I woke up for a while during the night. Maybe at around 4. I think I just stayed up a little too long when I woke up.
12/5/20 21:15 - Joe: That sucks. I hope things get better for her.
12/5/20 21:17 - Joe: Hahah that fucking plant! You’ll get it though!
12/5/20 21:22 - Joe: Here...this is my favorite radio station on the island if you want to try to find some new island music. Maybe it will help hahaha

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RfJXpxXOUeAwjTnONashG?nd=1
12/5/20 21:23 - Joe: That’s the actual radio station so you’ll probably hear commercials and all that too. But they play some good shit
12/5/20 21:29 - Lorena: uhh muy pronto!! en que pensarías! jajaa
12/5/20 21:29 - Lorena: Si, pobre.. es una chica super positiva siempre, pero esta vez esta jodida!
12/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: jaja eso espero, no me motiva mucho la textura de la hoja, y sé que no esta del todo bien.. pero lo intento por si hay suerte y así dejo de hacerla jajaja
12/5/20 21:32 - Lorena: Gracias, la acabo de guardar en mi spotify!!
12/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:36 - Lorena: Encontrá la palabra
12/5/20 21:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: biennnn!
12/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: jaja, el otro día la escuché mientras estaba con el curso, siempre pongo esta música, y me acordé de vos
12/5/20 21:39 - Lorena: aunque es dificil lo que dice en español, es un acento muy cerrado del sur
12/5/20 21:40 - Joe: Yeah it sounded a little different for sure. What song is that? I think it might be one of the ones you send me
12/5/20 21:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:43 - Joe: hella good vibes 😂 


Give me the name of the song pleeeaase
12/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: como pasó una canción por spotify? jaja
12/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: https://open.spotify.com/track/6bMRELN9nclL87w9XEMMnw?si=wsMnqx4MRw-pMo2Qw8qaTQ
12/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: A la luz del lorenzo ( jajaja en el sur de españa es tipico decir lorenzo al sol jajaja)
12/5/20 21:45 - Joe: I have Apple Music 😞 but I’ll find it on there. Thank you

12/5/20 21:51 - Joe: Haha it’s a little hard but not too crazy. The more accents I hear the better, then I won’t be shocked when I come across it in real life
12/5/20 21:54 - Joe: I’ve been trying to learn the basics again haha. I found out that you can understand about 80% of spoken Spanish if you learn the 1000 most used words 

I think I can do that 👨‍🏫

12/5/20 22:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:06 - Joe: Oooh dude! I watched the last episode of la casa de Papel. They ended in the worst place!
12/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: "Y a la luz del lorenzo yo desayuno a lo fresco, una tostá con mermelá"
12/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: ohhhh, el último!!! jaja te gustó la serie??
12/5/20 22:09 - Lorena: 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
12/5/20 22:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:09 - Joe: Fuck
12/5/20 22:09 - Joe: Shit
12/5/20 22:09 - Joe: Dammit
12/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: Jajajajajaja
12/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: Me encanta!
12/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Haha thanks. I’m getting slowly I think
12/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: como?? jajaja
12/5/20 22:16 - Joe: Haha nothing never mind.
12/5/20 22:17 - Lorena: me gustó mucho ese audio, jajaja espero no perderlo!!!
12/5/20 22:17 - Joe: But now I need to find out how many English words you need to learn to get a good understanding. Going to need it if you’re going to Hawaii 😂 

I wonder if it’s more, less, or the same amount of words 🤔
12/5/20 22:18 - Joe: Haha you can save it and use it to embarrass me later
12/5/20 22:18 - Lorena: jajajaja averigualo, si son más de 1000, venis vos a España!
12/5/20 22:19 - Joe: If you say so 😂 😂 😂
12/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: Sos malo!
12/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:21 - Joe: Hahah I’m seriously going to find out how many words
12/5/20 22:22 - Joe: But I would be happy to come visit you in Spain so I’m not complaining there haha
12/5/20 22:23 - Joe: “
If you learn only 800 of the most frequently-used lemmas in English, you'll be able to understand 75% of the language as it is spoken in normal life.”
12/5/20 22:23 - Lorena: Me dijiste que nos veríamos, tenés que sacarte el pasaporte y venir a Españaaaa! jajaja
12/5/20 22:24 - Joe: Oh we’re going to meet hahah whether I go there or you come here or we go wherever we want...it’ll happen. I promise.
12/5/20 22:25 - Lorena: es más dificil para mi!!!! jaja tengo que aprender lemas, no palabras, además aprendo un 75 en vez de 80% 🐌
12/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:27 - Joe: Haha true true. 5% different is weird though. In spanish you get 80% understanding with 1000 words but only get an additional 5% for the next 1000. 

So 2000 words puts you at 85% understanding of spoken Spanish
12/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: Jajaja dos gifs en respuesta a tu frase de vernos!
12/5/20 22:28 - Joe: And native speakers now between 10,000-20,000 words 🤯
12/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Hahaha perfect gifs. I’m really excited to make it happen so I’m glad you’re happy about it.
12/5/20 22:29 - Lorena: Jajajaja tantas palabras sabemos? Mmm
12/5/20 22:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:31 - Joe: Aaaah this is going to be hard hahah. It took me about a month or two to memorize the top 200 drug brand names and their generic names when I was a pharmacy technician(like the assistant for the pharmacist)
12/5/20 22:32 - Joe: 😊 😊 😊
12/5/20 22:32 - Lorena: uuuuuh, jajaja super dificil los nombres de farmacias, jaja yo siempre los pronuncio como 3 veces cuando voy a una farmacia
12/5/20 22:32 - Lorena: I will take care that you learn many words! from right now !!!
12/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: Migas ( crumbs)
12/5/20 22:34 - Joe: Yeah learning those was no fun. Now they’re taking up room in my brain cause I don’t need that shit anymore hahaha
12/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: bigote ( moustache)
12/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: esas dos de la canción, y vamos a buscar más
12/5/20 22:34 - Joe: Send 10 words for today. I’ll study them 📖
12/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: tosta' con mermela' ( se abrevia en el sur así, y no pronuncian las dos ultimas letras= tostada con mermelada )
12/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: toast with jam
12/5/20 22:37 - Joe: Haha that’s like a breakfast one. I’ll use that 😂
12/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: regalito ( es regalo, se dice "ito" es un diminutivo, se usa para decir como un regalo pequeño, pero también como cariñosamente)
12/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: Vino Papá Noel la noche de nochebuena
Y me dejó un regalito junto a la candela
Cuando yo lo vi enseguida lo abrí
Y vi que era una planta de yerbagüena
12/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: planta de yerbaguena, es una palabra un poco inventada, para referirse a la marihuana
12/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: Pero yo no soy Pinocho que el corazón (heart) tiene de madera (wood)
12/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: okey, me faltan dos!!! jaja
12/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: primavera ( spring)
12/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: sangre (blood)
12/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: esas 10 palabras, estan en la canción " de a la luz del lorenzo"
12/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: ME VOLVÍ LOCA JAJA ahora te las voy a decir para que las escuches como se pronuncian
12/5/20 22:44 - Joe: Haha no worries I’ll have time to study it while you sleep. 

Yes, send the pronunciation so I’m not practicing the wrong way please
12/5/20 22:44 - Lorena: 1. Migas 2. Bigote 2. tostada 3. Mermelada 4. Regalo- Regalito 5. Planta de marihuana 6. corazón 7. Madera 8. Primavera 9. Sangre 10. Lorenzo ( sol, en sur de españa)

12/5/20 22:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/5/20 22:47 - Joe: Thank you professor 👩‍🏫 

I’ll work on those today!
12/5/20 22:50 - Joe: Oh and if you have more music in spanish for me to listen to, I’ll take that as well haha. 

I feel like just hearing words over and over again helps a lot even if I don’t understand the word yet
12/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: Nada lindo!
12/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RH_Ol2tUCY
12/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: acento uruguay y argentina, a ver si lo entendés! yo (suena como sho), zapatillas ( zapatishas), astillas (astishas),  la letra "LL" se pronuncia como "sh"
12/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Hahaha i noticed right away when  I heard “sho”(yo) at the beginning of the song.
12/5/20 22:59 - Joe: “Y yo de día”
12/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: geeeeenio!!!
12/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
12/5/20 23:02 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAjASemgx3E
12/5/20 23:03 - Joe: I’m going to end up with a strange accent. Mix of all the places haha
12/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: jajaa mira esta!!! Calle 13, es un grupo de música de Puerto Rico. El videoclip es una mierda, jaja pero su música esta bien, es como una mezcla. los ritmos...son muy famosos jajaja...
12/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: No, vos tenés que tener mi acento! jajaja
12/5/20 23:04 - Joe: Muerte en Hawaii? What are you trying to say 😱 hahaha
12/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: Si no, no te haré caso! jajaja
12/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: JAJAJAJAJAA
12/5/20 23:07 - Joe: Hahaha ok ok. I’ll try my best to have an accent like yours. I think it sounds beautiful anyway so I’m fine with that 😂
12/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: hahaha thanks, it is also the one that works best for you!!
12/5/20 23:11 - Lorena: Also, Spanish speakers will listen to you fun and interesting and won't bother you too much...jijiii
12/5/20 23:17 - Joe: I don’t know why either but I wish I would’ve found out earlier. When I speak with your accent I sound a lot less like a super white boy trying to learn hahaha. I always hated the way my Spanish accent sounded. It’s so bad
12/5/20 23:18 - Joe: Good. I can be my boring self but they’ll at least find my accent interesting. +10 points
13/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: pues mira, al final encontraste el acento que no te hace sentir así jajajaj. A mí me parece muy adorable/sexy cuando te escucho el acento "gringo/guiri" con el español con acento uru ☺️
13/5/20 0:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 0:32 - Joe: Kidding kidding. Don’t stop 😂
13/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: Jajajajajaja
13/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: You're funny, I can't help not answer you
13/5/20 0:33 - Joe: Why do you say that? Are you trying to ignore me?
13/5/20 0:33 - Joe: I would be
13/5/20 0:34 - Lorena: Mmmm jaja no exactamente
13/5/20 0:39 - Joe: Haha I mean...just let me know if you want me to disappear
13/5/20 0:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Did you have your late night dinner yet? And go out on the street with your fake pass today?
13/5/20 0:43 - Lorena: Mmm
13/5/20 0:45 - Joe: Mmm? What? No? Fine then I guess you’re stuck with me 🤷‍♂️
13/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: Es que me pasa que no tengo muchas ganas de hablar con otros "amigos" , por que prefiero hablar con vos... Por eso digo que no puedo dejar de responderte ...
13/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: Por tanto no quiero que dejes de hablarme!
13/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: No sé jaja fue una frase que dije sin pensar demasiado y ahora tuve que pensar como explicarla jajaja
13/5/20 0:51 - Joe: Hahah don’t worry I’m just messing with you.
13/5/20 0:52 - Joe: I’m the same so I know exactly what you mean.
13/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Otros amigos= chicos
13/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Con mis amigas habló casi todos los días jajajaj
13/5/20 0:53 - Joe: Hahaha for sure
13/5/20 0:55 - Joe: Still....same, but with girls haha I was actually really content just being on my own for the time being and talking to girls usually leads to something I wasn’t trying to get into. At least not on purpose haha I’m still glad you messaged me
13/5/20 0:58 - Joe: Glad I can keep your attention from across the world better than the other boys though hahaha
13/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: well I'm not soo happy, haha ​​I should be more interested in those who are "real"
13/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: well yes happy to meet you and spend time together talking haha
13/5/20 1:00 - Joe: Are you calling me pinocho? Cause I’m a real boy hahaha
13/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: Fuck jajaj
13/5/20 1:01 - Joe: 😂 I got no strings. Promise. I’m a real boy hahah
13/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: Jajaja real me refiero a...
13/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: Poder verte la cara, darte un beso, un abrazo, sexo, dormir, jaja básicos de la vida real
13/5/20 1:04 - Joe: Haha I know what you meant. I wish I was closer to you now, but I’m telling you I’ll make it happen. I’ll be real for you soon enough
13/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jajaja no te asustes con esto
13/5/20 1:06 - Joe: Not at all haha that’s real life. I wish it was real for us. Very sooooooooon!!
13/5/20 1:08 - Joe: Knowing someone cares about you is always great but there’s something about feeling their touch. I know people crave that feeling of being together so it’s not weird at all.
13/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 1:11 - Joe: Hahaha that’s me?
13/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: No sé quién de los dos exactamente
13/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: Jajaja
13/5/20 1:12 - Joe: 😂
13/5/20 1:13 - Joe: I guess you seem to be opening up a little more too. I appreciate the honesty.
13/5/20 1:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: Jajajaa con mi pensamiento de que no puedo ver al chico que me interesa cuando acabe la cuarentena
13/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Hahaha
13/5/20 1:17 - Joe: You really don’t think it will happen?
13/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Do you not believe me?
13/5/20 1:18 - Joe: Or will you change your mind? You only like me because you CAN’T see me even if you want to ?hahaha
13/5/20 1:22 - Joe: Alright alright. Let me ask you.....what are your honest expectations? And what would be ideal?(what would make you happiest?)
13/5/20 1:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: jajaja perdón, mmm no sé!
13/5/20 1:24 - Joe: Haha it’s ok. Think about it. It’s your life. Take some time before you tell me if you need to
13/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: simplemente me vinieron esos pensamientos a la cabeza, que me gustaría pasar un buen rato ahora mismo o cuando acabe la cuarentena con una persona que no conozco realmente, solo a través de mensajes, que esta a muchísimos km, pero que a pesar de eso, me sigue interesando jaja
13/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: Si, te creo! por que sé que esto me lo dijiste después de semanas de estar hablando, no fue el primer día!!
13/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: pero claro, estamos ahora mismo en una pandemia, en España tenemos que pasar fases, y las fronteras estarán cerradas hasta principios de 2021
13/5/20 1:29 - Lorena: y la paciencia, no es mi fuerte, jaja yo quiero verte ya, ahora mismo, 13/05 a las 1:27 hs jajajaja
13/5/20 1:30 - Joe: Well....you don’t have to put your life on pause for me. You’re a grown up and you have a life outside of talking to a stranger on the internet. Do whatever makes you happy. Just stay in touch and we’ll see what happens.
13/5/20 1:33 - Lorena: mmmm obviamente Joe, solo te solté pensamientos que tuve nada más!
13/5/20 1:33 - Lorena: tampoco me lo digas así, tan serio.. jaja
13/5/20 1:34 - Joe: Hahaha a grownup? Ok never again 😂
13/5/20 1:34 - Joe: Stranger on the internet? Which one?
13/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: Toda la oración completa
13/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: jaja
13/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: haha well sorry, I shouldn't have said anything, I'm a little impulsive 🤐🤐
13/5/20 1:38 - Joe: Hahah alright. Ugh. This already would’ve been complicated without the pandemic. I don’t know. I’m pretty patient but I know you said you’re not 😂
13/5/20 1:43 - Joe: I have to do some research on these rules. This is bullshit hahah. I’m going to make this happen
13/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: haha no proooblem, we'll see you when we can! 🌎
13/5/20 1:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Alright enough nonsense. I’m going to do a little bit of work and study those words you gave me. And tonight I’m not keeping you up late haha. I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches

13/5/20 21:18 - Lorena: Ah, antes que me olvide ( gracias por las fotos de las casitas, me encantan! )
13/5/20 21:18 - Lorena: uoooo jajaja 1.000 palabras
13/5/20 21:21 - Joe: 1000 words to keep Lore happy. What could they be 🤔
13/5/20 21:22 - Lorena: my quarantined mind can now think of many things 😈🤓 hahaha ...better, tell me the things you want to tell me and I'll tell you how they say in Spanish
13/5/20 21:22 - Lorena: jajaja me gusta esto!
13/5/20 21:23 - Joe: Haha that’s not a bad thing. Tell me anything you like. Maybe something you ask for a lot. Or really anything at all.
13/5/20 21:26 - Lorena: haha nah, you must have the initiative to say that you, and I teach you as in Spanish, we get 10 words of thoughts that you want to tell me, that make sense, or nonsense
13/5/20 21:28 - Joe: Hahah mine are boring. I can only think of objects hahaha
13/5/20 21:29 - Joe: Skateboard, headphones, computer, shorts, hats 🤔

But seriously I don’t know what i want to learn or at least I don’t know what would be useful
13/5/20 21:32 - Lorena: jajaja
13/5/20 21:32 - Joe: Hahahaha well you can teach me the “good” one 😂
13/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: mmm varias maneras de decirlo
13/5/20 21:33 - Joe: Follar?
13/5/20 21:33 - Joe: I’m not asking hahaha I’m asking if that’s the word
13/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: exacto jajaj
13/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: te las voy a explicar, para que las sepas bien!!! jaja
13/5/20 21:34 - Joe: I learned follar from Denver hahaha
13/5/20 21:35 - Joe: Or wait I meant to laugh like this.....uhuhuhuh
13/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: fuck you.. puede ser como una manera de decir a alguien, negativa o cariñoso.. en España sería .... " vete a la mierda"  "vete a tomar por culo"  en uruguay sería " anda a cagar" " andate a la mierda" "andate a la concha de tu madre"
13/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: jajaja dios, que mal hablados que somos en uruguay, jajaja
13/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: sería como "jodete...pero no mucha gente dice esa palabra, se dicen mas las otras que te dije arriba... para fuck you
13/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: jajajaj y esta.... sería...
13/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: En España : follar en Uruguay : Cojer
13/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: aplicado en una frase.. sería!
13/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: (mierda, no voy a imaginarlo meintras lo digo, lo promero jaja)
13/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: "Quiero follarte" ( España) "Quiero cojerte" ( Uruguay)
13/5/20 21:39 - Lorena: *prometo
13/5/20 21:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 21:42 - Lorena: How well do you understand Spanish now! hahaa
13/5/20 21:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: okey, vamos a practicarlo... pregunta.. "Querés cojerme?"
13/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: mierdaaaaaaa jajaja nuuu 🙊🙈
13/5/20 21:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 21:45 - Joe: Hahah
13/5/20 21:45 - Joe: You didn’t tell me how to say it yet
13/5/20 21:45 - Joe: But that’s my guess
13/5/20 21:47 - Joe: Hahahahaha wait....did I just ask if you want to have sex with me in that??? I don’t even know what you made me say ahahah
13/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: jajajaajajajaja
13/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 21:48 - Joe: I’m going to get slapped learning from you hahaha
13/5/20 21:49 - Lorena: esta bien dicho, pero con una vos demasiado dulce para la palabra en si jaja
13/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: VOZ
13/5/20 21:53 - Joe: Haha dammit. Ok how would you say it? And what did I say exactly? Is it like “do you want to fuck me”
13/5/20 21:54 - Lorena: Querés cojerme? sounds like "do you want me to buy cakes for you?)
13/5/20 21:54 - Joe: Hahahaha buy cakes???
13/5/20 21:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 21:56 - Lorena: haha if it's a way of saying, as sweet for the meaning of the word, it doesn't sound convincing if the decision to someone like that if he wants to " cojer con vos" hahaha
13/5/20 21:57 - Joe: Haha ok ok makes sense. So what if i actually want someone to buy me cake? 😂
13/5/20 21:58 - Joe: Don’t want to ask you for a cake for my birthday and you get the wrong idea.
13/5/20 21:59 - Joe: Don’t want the opposite either hahah
13/5/20 22:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 22:00 - Lorena: Jajaja 🤔
13/5/20 22:03 - Joe: You’re going to say it to me one day, and I’ll be expecting cake for dessert. Then I’ll be so confused when you start coming on to me. Like where the hell is my cake dammit Hahahaha
13/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: miiiiiiiierda jajaja te confundí con la expresión de la tarta... olvidate de eso!!!!! jajaja
13/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Sorry my friends did a group video chat  hahaha

14/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:01 - Joe: Muy bien jajajaja me encanta. Más porfi 😂
14/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: Jajaja me entendés algo?
14/5/20 1:04 - Joe: Oh yeah I understood! 

Let’s me think about it though....I have to listen again haha hold on
14/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: porfiiii jajajaa
14/5/20 1:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:08 - Joe: I don’t know if anyone would say that sentence about someone that’s talking to me though hahaha
14/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Es que vos lo pronuncias perfecto jajaj
14/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: No?? Sería como una "indirecta", no se usa?
14/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: 🤔
14/5/20 1:10 - Joe: Haha don’t worry, english is ugly. Español es muy bonita
14/5/20 1:11 - Joe: Hah it’s used. But you would be unlucky talking to me hahahah
14/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: Ahhhhhh
14/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: Jajaj
14/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: No lo creo
14/5/20 1:13 - Joe: Sorry bad joke haha. But my pronunciation is only good because I’ve heard Spanish all my life. A lot of people speak Spanish in California and a lot of my family does. I just never learned enough to converse fluently.
14/5/20 1:14 - Lorena: Jaja no, fue buena. Pero pensé que no me entendías "la indirecta"
14/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: Ah sí, tramposoo, yo pasó más vergüenza que vos pronunciado, digo oso en vez de cerveza jajaj
14/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: Vos sabés español y no me lo querés decir para que te enseñe jajaja
14/5/20 1:16 - Joe: Hahahaha
14/5/20 1:17 - Joe: I wish I knew spanish. It’d make things a lot easier 😂
14/5/20 1:19 - Joe: But I’ve gotten way better in a few weeks. Listening to hella Spanish music and watched all 4 seasons of la casa haha
14/5/20 1:21 - Joe: And i make sure to read all your messages in Spanish before I translate them and try to figure out what it says beforehand. Definitely need the translator less often. I used it for literally every message at the beginning 🤷‍♂️
14/5/20 1:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:23 - Joe: Hahaha damn I only get every few words because my brain is processing words I notice then I miss a few words then I notice another
14/5/20 1:23 - Joe: It’s ok I’ll translate it but I don’t want to haha
14/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:26 - Joe: Hahaha you have to talk to me slow like a damn baby 😂
14/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:28 - Joe: Ah mirá vos no sabía blah blah blah hahahaha
14/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: Ahora bebé?

14/5/20 1:30 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂 oh yeaaaah much better
14/5/20 1:30 - Joe: Give me a few more months and I’ll understand perfectly
14/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:35 - Joe: You’re surprised and going to show me something?? Ahaha fuck I’m already getting it wrong probably haha
14/5/20 1:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:36 - Lorena: Sorprendida con el cambio
14/5/20 1:36 - Joe: Hahahaha well it was true. If you wanted me to speak to you in spanish and for you to speak to me in spanish it wasn’t possible 😂
14/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: Nueva actitud jaja! Nunca imaginé que después de ese mensaje, intentarías hablar español
14/5/20 1:37 - Joe: Haha I guessed correct on this. I learned cambio yesterday haha
14/5/20 1:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 1:40 - Joe: That’s you throwing the ball. Shooting your shot hahah and I’m just there....like an idiot
14/5/20 1:41 - Lorena: Jajajajaja si, un poquito
14/5/20 1:42 - Lorena: Te diré cuando me acuerde número siete!
14/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: Dos semanas y media después empezamos a hablar jajaja 🕺💃
14/5/20 1:44 - Joe: Haha I just needed some time to realize my mistake 😂
14/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Jjjjj bueno, aprenderás español y podrás hablar con toda tu familia!
14/5/20 1:48 - Joe: That baseball gif has me laughing too much. That’s totally me. All my life hahah
14/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🙈🙈🙈
14/5/20 1:49 - Joe: I’m going to go to Peru if I learn!!Hella family in Peru haha
14/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Si, cuando te conocí un poco más me di cuenta que eras tímido jjjj .. aunque cada vez menos
14/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Llévame!!! Jaja hay lindas playas en Perú
14/5/20 1:52 - Joe: Yeah it sounds really cool. I wish I could’ve seen it when my grandparents were little though. My grandma said she had a penguin as pet! I was jealous when I heard that haha.
14/5/20 1:54 - Joe: I already made up my mind, and even if we don’t end up doing something together I’m leaving California after the summer again so it’s just a matter of where I want to go at this point. Hopefully I’m ready to go to the spanish speaking countries but even if I’m not, what’s a better way to learn than going where everyone speaks Spanish?
14/5/20 1:56 - Joe: I don’t know, I just want to do something exciting I guess. And I’m tired of California haha
14/5/20 1:57 - Lorena: Que capa! / Que jefa! Tu abuela con un pingüino de mascota.
14/5/20 1:57 - Joe: Of course I would prefer to end up in the same country as you though. That would be great
14/5/20 1:58 - Joe: The chicks in la casa remind me of my grandma when they do badass shit. She’s a badass lady haha
14/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: Mmmm manera de aprender español sin viajar a un país de habla hispana? 

Sería o una academia, o cómo estás haciendo ahora de manera autodidacta. App, películas, series, conversación con nativo, etc
14/5/20 2:01 - Lorena: Ah.. cual es el mejor lugar para aprender español?
14/5/20 2:03 - Joe: Hahah I guess it was kind rhetorical(?) like....it is probably the best way to learn. People learn the fastest when they go to a country that speaks the language they’re trying to learn
14/5/20 2:04 - Lorena: Ah qué boluda
14/5/20 2:04 - Lorena: Jaja perdona, pensé que me lo estabas preguntando
14/5/20 2:05 - Lorena: Me parece buena idea que viajes, además aprendiendo un idioma, conociendo nuevos lugares
14/5/20 2:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 2:06 - Joe: Haha no worries. By the way, I just got approved to follow that Instagram page that you tried to share with me from. 

So when you see good memes from them, send them to meeee
14/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Getting to where you are is the goal 😂
14/5/20 2:07 - Joe: And understanding you without you having to speak in slow motion hahaha
14/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: Jajajaja
14/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: Hablaré lento siempre que lo necesites ☺️
14/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: Sii te mandaré memes, veo todo el rato durante esta puta cuarentena jajaja y muchos vídeos de animales
14/5/20 2:10 - Joe: Haha gracias! It’s been really fun getting to know you even with all this language barrier bullshit. Getting that out of the way would be great
14/5/20 2:11 - Joe: But that’s why I’m learning haha
14/5/20 2:12 - Joe: Ah bien. no puedo esperar para juzgar sus memes 👨‍⚖️
14/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: Si, es divertido. Yo creo que nunca había dedicado tanto tiempo a inglés jaja
14/5/20 2:13 - Lorena: No sé cómo los dos mantenemos la atención para tener conversaciones.. sin ninguno saber el idioma de otro jaja es algo muy curioso
14/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: Mierdaaaa
14/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 2:15 - Joe: Haha ok I have a question. I was going to say “I agree” or “same”. Super short answer. What would you use for that?
14/5/20 2:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 2:16 - Joe: Igualmente? Mismo? No se
14/5/20 2:16 - Lorena: Sería... "Pienso lo mismo" o  "totalmente de acuerdo"
14/5/20 2:17 - Joe: Haha these will be useful for me
14/5/20 2:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 2:18 - Joe: I always end up agreeing with you or feel similar when you describe something haha.
14/5/20 2:18 - Lorena: Y si es en negativo... Sería " no pienso lo mismo" " no estoy de acuerdo"
14/5/20 2:18 - Joe: Perfecto. Gracias
14/5/20 2:19 - Joe: 😂 😂
14/5/20 2:19 - Lorena: Jaja gracias, "yo también" me too ( esta es otra opción)
14/5/20 2:21 - Joe: My brain is getting flooded with words and phrases haha. So much information aaaaahhhhhhh
14/5/20 2:21 - Lorena: Jajaj te dejo en paz!!!
14/5/20 2:22 - Lorena: Ahora intenta hablar con más gente en inglés así descansas del español
14/5/20 2:22 - Lorena: 😅
14/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: Esos memes son una mierda , jaja te mando un vídeo y me voy a dormir jjj

14/5/20 8:09 - Joe: Hahaha thanks for not making fun of me too much. I laughed when I heard the avocado say that line so I had to learn it 😂
14/5/20 8:12 - Lorena: Sii, puto español jaja tiene mil variaciones

14/5/20 19:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

14/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

14/5/20 21:11 - Joe: 😂 😂 shit
14/5/20 21:12 - Joe: Yeah I can’t complain at all. Really thinking about canceling that plane ticket next month haha
14/5/20 21:21 - Lorena: Yo si fuese vos, perdía ese vuelo!
14/5/20 21:23 - Lorena: pero en un mes... se puede salir en avión, acá tenemos cerradas las fronteras y la gente que tenía vuelo pagado, tuvo la opción de cambiar de fecha, o la opción de elegir viajar cuando se levante el estado de alarma
14/5/20 21:24 - Lorena: Check it out, you can stay longer, and you don't lose money hahaha
14/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 21:31 - Joe: I’m reaaaaallly considering it.
14/5/20 21:31 - Joe: Hahah! Is that for the plant?
14/5/20 21:32 - Lorena: Sii
14/5/20 21:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 21:33 - Joe: Good score too haha. Excellent 😊
14/5/20 21:33 - Joe: They’re never going to let us see each other huh? 😔
14/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: Jajaja ya...esta jodidoo!!
14/5/20 21:47 - Joe: Woah that’s pretty fuckin cool hahah. Siiiiiick 😂
14/5/20 21:48 - Joe: Way more realistic than I imagined the final result would look like. Not because of your skill or anything but because I didn’t know the program could make things look like that
14/5/20 21:49 - Joe: Hahahahaha “la puta planta, con su puta maceta” 😂 😂 

You really didn’t like making that one haha
14/5/20 21:50 - Joe: I would use this chair! Haha very nice work
14/5/20 21:57 - Lorena: Ohhhh muchas gracias Joe!!!
14/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: Si, puede ser realista si dedicas tiempo y no da muchos problemas jajaja, mi profesor, es diseñador de videojuegos, el sabe todos los trucos jaja, todos los días le escribo por skype
14/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: es un chico super joven, sabe mucho!!
14/5/20 21:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 22:01 - Lorena: jajaaja si, la odiaba... lo único que me gustaba era hacer la tierra, eso no dio problemas jajaja
14/5/20 22:02 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aIuna5a8Dc
14/5/20 22:03 - Joe: I want to know more about how it’s done. Seems complicated. Do you make make all the shapes with a bunch of little rectangles, squares, and triangles? Cause that shit seems like it would take forever
14/5/20 22:04 - Lorena: Argentine girls, in a super pretty and hippie town in Uruguay, called Cabo Polonio. the song is slow, you can still understand some words and a clear accent as always haha
14/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: jajaja para modelar se puede partir de una linea, caja, circulo..... luego se edita toda su geometría ( vertices, aristas, poligonos), se agregan modificadores, que hacen ciertas funciones a los objetos, como curvar una esquina, arrugar algun elemento, y luego dentro de esos modificadores, hay parametros de ajuste, como más formas, medidas, etc
14/5/20 22:13 - Joe: Aaah good. Some slow music so I can hear the words better hahah. 

I’m totally going to end up with that “sh” sound in my accent. All this Argentinian and Uruguayan content is programming my brain hahah


“se rie y yo lloro” sounds like “sho shorro”
14/5/20 22:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 22:14 - Joe: Sounds complicated as fuck
14/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: JAJAJAJJA

14/5/20 22:25 - Joe: Haha don’t worry about it. The more content the better for learning to be honest.
14/5/20 22:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 22:28 - Joe: Hahahahaha nunca!
14/5/20 22:28 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂
14/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Seriously, I appreciate everything you send me. It’s the thought that counts or something like that haha.
14/5/20 22:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: abrazo
14/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: jajaja, de nada!!!! pero bueno poco a poco te servirá para aprender idioma o palabras, y si viajas a algún país donde suene esta música, culturalmente estarás adaptado!
14/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: mierda.. jaja fuck apple

14/5/20 22:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/5/20 22:52 - Joe: Hahahaha dammit so another way to say “to fuck”!? Shiiiiiiiit
14/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: jajaja infinitas!!!
14/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: así es el español

15/5/20 20:02 - Lorena: Fuck you Joe, no me tenés registrada jaja
15/5/20 20:03 - Lorena: Creo que es privado...!
15/5/20 20:03 - Lorena: a ver espera que pruebo
15/5/20 20:03 - Joe: I don’t? I don’t even know what that means hahahah
15/5/20 20:04 - Joe: I follow them already but it doesn’t bring me to the post. Just the main page.
15/5/20 20:05 - Lorena: ya te lo mandé, por insta
15/5/20 20:06 - Lorena: jajaja que soy una desconocida en tus contactos, no estoy registrada, sin nombre. Aunque bueno... no me quejo, te vas a aprender mi número de memoria al final! jajajaa
15/5/20 20:07 - Joe: Oooooh I get it. Because I didn’t save your name? You’re the only one I talk to in WhatsApp haha. I have the whole app just for you!
15/5/20 20:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 20:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 20:11 - Lorena: This is better than not being named jjijiji
15/5/20 20:13 - Joe: I didn’t even realize you weren’t saved by name 😂
15/5/20 20:14 - Joe: When you message me the notifications already said “Lorena” so I didn’t notice haha
15/5/20 20:14 - Lorena: jajaj es broma, no pasa nada!!!
15/5/20 20:14 - Lorena: prefiero quedarme así
15/5/20 20:14 - Lorena: sin nombre jajaja
15/5/20 20:14 - Lorena: simplemente quería practicar la lección de ayer
15/5/20 20:15 - Joe: Hahaha you did very well. I was taken back for a second when I read “fuck you joe” 😆 didn’t see that coming
15/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: jajaja
15/5/20 20:24 - Lorena: Today the government was telling us if we went from phase, right now Madrid is in phase 0. And if we went to phase 1, everything was already organized so that the shops under 400 m2 reopen, and phase 2, greater than 800 m2 . ...
and to be able to be accompanied again with people who don´t live with you, such as friends, family, small groups...
15/5/20 20:25 - Lorena: but none of this will happen, we are still in fucking phase 0....😭
15/5/20 20:27 - Joe: Damn... this is fucked. When the lockdown first happened in the US all they were saying was that we need to “flatten the curve” so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. They made it seem like if we just brought the number of cases down to a number the hospitals could handle it would be fine.
15/5/20 20:29 - Joe: But now they’re making it seem like we’re locked down until it is gone completely or there is a vaccine or something. They keep moving the goalpost, which is annoying. 

I just want to know what the data needs to look like before things go back to normal. They can’t keep changing the rules hahaha
15/5/20 20:30 - Joe: Also the US is weird because the federal government might end the lockdown but individual states or cities can impose their own lockdowns so everything will open at different times across the country. 


Haha sorry that was a lot 😂
15/5/20 20:34 - Lorena: Is there someone who is very interested in the subject? haha ok, I like to read!
15/5/20 20:38 - Lorena: Yes, they did the same in Spain ... although first they scared us with the number of dead and infected doctors, then they had to change their minds, because people were paranoid and aggressive..
15/5/20 20:39 - Joe: What do you mean, “is there someone who is very interested”? Like, do I have a resource for you to read about it? Or are you saying that I’m interested in it because of how much I explained? Haha sorry 😐
15/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: I try to be shut up in a quiet house, but I hate politicians and the media more and more every day.....burned them all!
15/5/20 20:39 - Joe: The way the stories change isn’t very confidence inspiring haha
15/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Same hahaha. I’m considered an “independent” in the US. Republicans and democrats both get mad at me cause I talk shit about both sides hahah. Liberals accuse me of being conservative and conservatives accuse me of being liberal but really I’m in the middle and think they’re all idiots hahaha
15/5/20 20:41 - Lorena: jaja es como una pregunta retorica, cuando alguien muestra interés por algo...era una manera de decirlo..  jjjj como que estas interesado en el tema, y me di cuenta por las respuestas jaja
15/5/20 20:42 - Joe: And the media is the fucking worst. Very biased and it’s super noticeable.
15/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Aaaah ok. If you say it in English take of the “is”. It will sound/read more sarcastic or more like a joke. I don’t know why, but adding “is” makes it sound like a real question haha
15/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Take off* the “if”
15/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Fuck
15/5/20 20:44 - Joe: “Is”*
15/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Haha
15/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: jjj independiente, eso esta bien, pero espero que no tengas demasiados pensamientos conservadores jaja
15/5/20 20:46 - Joe: If you say, “someone is interested in the topic??” It would be great. Add “mmm” at the beginning or “eh” at the end and you’re a native speaker haha
15/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: totalmente!! es que repiten siempre lo mismo, hablan desde la puta ignorancia muchas veces, acá pones un programa de tv, con 4 personas que opinan, critican, juzgan... pero eso hace que el espectador que lo vea, sea manipulado con esa informacion
15/5/20 20:48 - Joe: Haha no not too many. I don’t agree with conservatives or liberals on much so I just talk shot about everyone. I used to be a Democrat which would be liberal but they went fucking insane in the last few years so now I’m stuck in the middle
15/5/20 20:48 - Lorena: jaja okey... mmm.... someone is interested in the topic? 🤓🙄
15/5/20 20:49 - Joe: Oh yeaaaaahhhh
15/5/20 20:49 - Joe: Perfecto
15/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: que pensamientos de conservador tenés Josephhhh?
15/5/20 20:50 - Joe: It’s been a long time since I watched the mainstream media. I get news from the internet hahah.
15/5/20 20:52 - Joe: 🤔 I think having a strong family is important. That’s considered a conservative value here. 

Other than that I’m not sure
15/5/20 20:53 - Lorena: jaja sii totalmente!
15/5/20 20:53 - Lorena: mmm stong family, what do you mean?
15/5/20 20:55 - Lorena: By the way, I never asked you, are you religious?
15/5/20 20:55 - Joe: I like to save money and I invest a lot of it. Not sure if that’s considered conservative haha
15/5/20 20:56 - Joe: Strong family like you believe in family bond, maybe marriage, although to answer your other question, I’m not really religious. I believe there is something special spiritually about the universe and the world but I don’t believe in organized religion.
15/5/20 20:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 20:57 - Joe: I’m not sure I even know what conservative values I have, if any, just that i disagree with the liberals often in this country.
15/5/20 20:58 - Joe: I disagree with conservatives a lot too. I disagree with everything and everyone 😂
15/5/20 21:00 - Joe: Everyone speaks in platitudes with no real solutions. They say things that sound nice and I hate it. 


People all remind me of when I was in elementary school and we did a mock election....some of the kids “running” for president would say “I’ll put a candy machine in the hallway!” and they would win cause all the kids would believe the nice sounding bullshit hahaha
15/5/20 21:01 - Lorena: jajaja y vos que proponias con esa edad?
15/5/20 21:02 - Joe: Haha I have too many thoughts on the subject of politics and media. Should not have got me started 😂
15/5/20 21:03 - Lorena: jajaja yo creo que si...  mmm
15/5/20 21:04 - Lorena: con que cosas de los liberales ahi no estas de acuerdo?
15/5/20 21:08 - Joe: Are you asking if I have any ideas? Well first thing that needs to happen in the US is an end to the massive divide we have right now. If one side has an idea, even if it’s good, the other side opposes it for political posturing. Literally nothing good gets done because we’re split in half. 

But after that if we’re all on one side we can look at the data objectively and use that to make decisions. Right now it looks like decisions are made for political purposes or based on feelings. Facts need to be the most important thing when considering anything. 

Then since the money printers are going “brrrrrr” printing trillions of dollars...I would give that to the people in the form of universal basic income. It would be a trickle up stimulus package instead of the trickle down stuff we’re getting. We have massive unemployment and food banks are running out of food so I would put a lot of focus there


I could go on for days about this hahahah so I’ll stop there
15/5/20 21:16 - Joe: 🤔 most recently the super liberal people here supported Bernie Sanders. I did too in 2016 because he wanted healthcare for everyone. But looking at his policies this time around, he had things like a federal jobs guarantee, which sounds wonderful. Making sure everyone who is capable of working has a job...but there are too many problems with it that no one ever dealt with....who is in charge? How much does everyone get paid? What if you don’t like the federal job you’ve been guaranteed? What happens when a president like Trump is in charge of the federal jobs guarantee and makes his workforce “build the wall”? What about the people that are not capable of working?



I’d say I’m way more liberal than conservative....it’s mostly that I don’t agree with the policy choices of the liberal politicians that I consider myself in the middle. 

The so called liberals here want to give too much power to the government and the conservatives want the government to basically do nothing but help rich people.


Okey sorry sorry. Please tell me a little about where you fall on the spectrum hahaha. What are you like?
15/5/20 21:18 - Lorena: eyeyey perdón, que fui justo al baño y me crucé con sandra que me estaba contando unas cosas
15/5/20 21:19 - Lorena: voy a leer todo lo que me pones, 1 seg jaja
15/5/20 21:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 21:20 - Lorena: 😍 un gif de mono, mi animal favorito con los perros. ( jajaj vuelvo al texto)
15/5/20 21:26 - Lorena: Yo creo que esto pasa en todos lados en diferente medida, en la política en si.. siempre hay separaciones, y luchas... lamentablemente se pierden buenas iniciativas para la población, por intereses económicos, sociales, religiosos, etc...
15/5/20 21:29 - Joe: The normal people come last. Basically I aligned very well with this politician named Andrew Yang this year. He was like my dream candidate hahaha. Very focused on working based of hard numbers/data and had actual solution oriented policies that would help average people. He wrote a book called The War on Normal People. Excellent book 📚
15/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: Si, parece que hay decisiones buenas para la gente, básicas como la salud y trabajo, y resulta que luego son un puto engaño... y al final parece que somos todos tontos, lo bueno es que ahí en cierto modo, por lo que comentas los estados pueden tomar sus propias decisiones ( no?)
15/5/20 21:32 - Lorena: Ay, me gustaría leerlo! investigaré sobre el!
15/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 21:35 - Joe: That’s my duuuuuude! Hahaha
15/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: jajaja
15/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: 1.000 dolis! que rico
15/5/20 21:38 - Joe: It’s weird. The states can do their own rules to make things stricter but not more relaxed than the federal government. Technically with marijuana laws a lot of states are breaking federal law but the federal government has mostly stopped enforcement on stores running legally in states.
15/5/20 21:39 - Joe: Haha it’ll make more sense after the book
15/5/20 21:39 - Lorena: Me da seguridad este hombre, yo sou consumista de Amazon ( por la facilidad), pero dejaría de hacerlo jaja
15/5/20 21:40 - Joe: I thought his ideas were kind of crazy at first but I researched them quite a bit and they would theoretically work well and give a lot of power to regular people
15/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: eso suena genial de poder a las personas comunes!
15/5/20 21:46 - Joe: 😂 😂 I’m fucking dead 💀
15/5/20 21:46 - Joe: Hahahaha
15/5/20 21:46 - Joe: Fuck
15/5/20 21:49 - Joe: Yeah it would be great. But if you read the book and learn about automation coming it looks like one of the only smart things to do. 


Amazon is starting to open stores that you walk in with your phone to check in, like getting on a subway with a pass that’s on your phone. Then you walk around and pick up what you want and leave. No cashiers. That’s one of the most common jobs here. Google is making a artificial intelligence telemarketer, that’s another common job. Basically automation will come over next 5-25 years and slowly take the most common jobs.
15/5/20 21:49 - Lorena: estoy leyendo un poco quién era antes
15/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: te iba a poner lo que estoy leyendo en español, en los artículos, pero por momentos me olvido de la barrera del idioma jaja
15/5/20 21:52 - Lorena: totalmente de acuerdo, me siento culpable
15/5/20 21:54 - Lorena: soy consciente de que hay puestos de trabajo que se eliminan, y que es una mierda, pero también la sociedad en la que vivimos, va a un ritmo muy rápido, y tenés que ajustarte a ella... yo no tengo tiempo o ganas incluso muchas veces, de recorrerme la ciudad para comprar un libro en un sitio, una cafetera en otro, etc.. es algo muy cómodo... y además podés ver opiniones del resto, es como que se crea una comunidad..
15/5/20 21:54 - Joe: It’s fine. The technology is there. Whether it’s Amazon or someone else it’s inevitable and should actually be desirable. But we need to make sure people have money even if they have no work. Then we can automate and be very happy about it.
15/5/20 21:55 - Lorena: I agree!
15/5/20 21:56 - Joe: If people are scared of automation and job losses because they’ll have no money it will only slow us down as a society
15/5/20 21:57 - Joe: Haha cool. I don’t want to sound like a crazy person 😂 

 But I love technology so I see how close it is and he had very good solutions before it becomes a problem
15/5/20 21:57 - Lorena: Okey, y basicamente cual sería la mejor opcion, que dice Andrew Yang de esto?
15/5/20 22:01 - Lorena: me refiero, como se pueden conservar todos esos puestos de trabajo, a pesar del ritmo que llevamos en la sociedad
15/5/20 22:02 - Lorena: al final, siempre vamos a buscar lo más rápido, cómodo, barato...
15/5/20 22:02 - Joe: Universal basic income. Income not tied to what you do for a living. It’s like this....in the US there is a disagreement about minimum wage. Some think it should go up, others say it would kill small businesses because only big businesses can afford that. I understand both sides. People need more money, small businesses can’t afford it. Universal basic income.
15/5/20 22:03 - Joe: You don’t. He would say, “we need to decouple human value from economic value and put the money directly in the people’s hands”
15/5/20 22:04 - Joe: Exactly. We should. I want that. I want the future where humans can do less tedious task and have more time for living. But they’ll need money to live
15/5/20 22:08 - Joe: And there will still be jobs and ways to move up the ladder in life but everyone will have at least a baseline of income to live from. 


He also gives many examples of people that aren’t valued economically today but do a lot of work we need. Stay at home parents, people that take care of loved ones, a lot of artist hahaha. Universal basic income gives those people something for contributing to society even if there is no way to make money from it. 

I don’t know. Seems like bullshit but amazon is close to eliminating retail, google is close to eliminating receptionist and telemarketers, telsa will get rid of the need for driving jobs. All relatively soon.
15/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Alright I’ve said waaaaay too much hahahahaha
15/5/20 22:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Fuck yeah 😂
15/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Make America Think Harder 😂 MATH
15/5/20 22:11 - Lorena: estaba leyendo y reflexionando sobre todo lo que decís!
15/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Told you that’s my dude
15/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: tenés razón, todo tiene su lógica y creo que seguramente nos iría mejor todo!
15/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: hay que encontar una manera en que la teconologia no destruya todos estos puestos de trabajo
15/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: y obviamente, una renta basica para todas las personas!
15/5/20 22:13 - Joe: No. We should destroy all jobs. Humans will create new better ones.
15/5/20 22:13 - Joe: Well. That’s my opinion hahaha
15/5/20 22:14 - Joe: But we should provide for everyone at the same time. You can’t create the next amazing thing if you work just to survive and barely even make it
15/5/20 22:14 - Lorena: que nuevos trabajos mejores crees que puede crear la gente?
15/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: no te dejo en paz! jajaja te tengo atrapado intentando imaginar un mundo mejor!
15/5/20 22:15 - Lorena: I won't leave you alone! hahaha I got you caught trying to imagine a better world!🙈
15/5/20 22:17 - Joe: Hahaa this comes from the minds of the humans with more time to think. There will always be problems to solve and ways to make life better. Also, if there was a universal basic income, people can be secure in doing what they love. Even if it makes less money than you could survive on without the basic income.
15/5/20 22:17 - Lorena: yo no tenía ni idea de el significado de tu gorra, jaja desde el primer día que te ví ahi estabas, defensor de Yang jajaa
15/5/20 22:17 - Lorena: 💙
15/5/20 22:17 - Joe: Hahahahah
15/5/20 22:18 - Joe: Haha I got very passionate about these ideas and studied them a lot. I spent a lot of time thinking about this 😂
15/5/20 22:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:19 - Joe: Un foto
15/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: por esto
15/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: por esto
15/5/20 22:20 - Lorena: y por esto
15/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: casate conmigo jajaja
15/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: es hermosa, me encanta ese azul y blanco!!!!
15/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: *una
15/5/20 22:21 - Joe: Unaaaaa
15/5/20 22:22 - Joe: It’s right by the water too. Beautiful
15/5/20 22:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:26 - Lorena: * Casate jaja .... each other? jjaja ¿¿¿sdSDPJDSAHJSdkjdkd
15/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: Si, es linda! con un arco
15/5/20 22:27 - Joe: Oh shit before I get distracted sending pictures I was going to ask how you would describe yourself
15/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: me gusta su forma...!!! de que color la pintamos? jajaja
15/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: jaja en cuanto a ideales te referís?
15/5/20 22:28 - Joe: Still comes up “to marry” soooo 🤷‍♂️ 


But alright if you insist 😂
15/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Seems like you like the blue and white houses so we’ll go with that haha
15/5/20 22:30 - Lorena: jajaja mi color preferido es el verde, verde turquesa.. pero esas azules me encantaría azul y blanca también jaja
15/5/20 22:30 - Joe: Haha yeah I suppose
15/5/20 22:31 - Joe: Hahahahah damn stealing my color preferences and shit
15/5/20 22:32 - Joe: 🙄
15/5/20 22:33 - Lorena: mmm... no me guío tanto por los politicos, normalmente son todos unos mentirosos y me cuesta creerles, incluso si alguno tiene razón en algo, siempre es un titere por los intereses que hay detrás. Solo me identifico con uno de ellos, un ex presidente uruguayo, "Pepe Mujica", tengo admiración por ese hombre y su filosofía
15/5/20 22:34 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll learn about him while you learn about Andrew Yang
15/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: en realidad lo que yo pienso, y me gustaría para mi futuro, y de las siguientes generaciones, es que no se pierda nunca la importancia de la sanidad, una buena asistencia médica para todo el mundo, sin restricciones
15/5/20 22:37 - Joe: Yeah that’s a necessary thing. Seems obvious especially now.
15/5/20 22:37 - Lorena: la educación también me parece clave, me gusta mucho los sistemas educativos, que utilizan diferentes países nórdicos, como Finlandia principalmente... ser más prácticos, no tan cuadriculados, poder valorar que existen diferentes tipos de inteligencias, que se valore más todo el tema cultural, en cuanto a artes, música, etc
15/5/20 22:37 - Joe: Ok ok I like that
15/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: y al final la educación es importante también, para los futuros puestos de trabajo... todos son validos, que cada uno pueda elegir lo que le guste realmente, que no existan tantas diferencias salariales
15/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: en cuanto a tema económico, una renta básica independientemente si hay actividad o no, seria lo ideal, por todo lo que comentaste anteriorimente, es lo mínimo... hay muchas situaciones jodidas, y la gente no deberia quedar excluida, o pasar hambre, por no tener comida básica
15/5/20 22:41 - Joe: A more equitable future for everyone basically. Sounds reasonable
15/5/20 22:42 - Joe: I’ll send you a hat 😂
15/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: y bueno, Mujica, por ejemplo en Uruguay adoptó medidas que para mi son significativas, son una evolución, y me siento orgullosa que en un pais de america latina se hayan adoptado medidas como, legalizacion de marihuana,  matrimonio homosexual, opcion a aboto legal, y ayudas para gente pobre
15/5/20 22:45 - Joe: Damn y’all beat us to legalizing weed? Fuck I’m going to Uruguay hahah
15/5/20 22:45 - Joe: You can meet me there 😂
15/5/20 22:46 - Joe: But all of the other things are good as well. You should be proud. I’m embarrassed to be from America sometimes 🤦‍♂️
15/5/20 22:47 - Lorena: *ABORTO ( no sé que traducción te habrá dado Google) jaja
15/5/20 22:47 - Lorena: jajaja 💪🏻
15/5/20 22:47 - Joe: Haha I figured that one out
15/5/20 22:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:52 - Joe: Hahaha siiiick. Now I like this Pepe guy already
15/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Pepe no lleva traje fue muy criticado
15/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Fue torturado y encarcelado durante 12 años
15/5/20 22:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: Dona parte de su sueldo para ayudas, escuelas, etc
15/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: Y no vive en la casa presidencial
15/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: Hermossaaaaa foto!
15/5/20 22:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/5/20 22:59 - Joe: Damn Pepe is a boss
15/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Creo que pondré este vídeo al despertarme y acostarme jajaj es demasiado lindo, esos colores 😍
15/5/20 23:03 - Joe: One day. You’ll be there.
15/5/20 23:03 - Joe: With me hahahah
15/5/20 23:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

15/5/20 23:52 - Joe: Your dogs get so much affection from you. You’re very sweet.
15/5/20 23:57 - Lorena: Jaja gracias, si me encantan los perros. Las quiero muchísimo y las extraño ahora mismo jaja
16/5/20 0:06 - Joe: I can tell by the videos. Hopefully you’ll be with them soon. They can’t keep the world like this forever.
16/5/20 0:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: hopefully! When I'm with them, I'll send you something!
16/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: 😱😱😱😱 Dios!!!
16/5/20 0:16 - Lorena: que grande es, jajaja quiero ver cuando lo cortes!
16/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: Vos con los aguacates, y Angela con Oni jajaja
16/5/20 0:24 - Joe: Yeah definitely send more. Though I would rather see in person you with your dogs haha


The small avocado is grown in Mexico. The big one is a Hawaiian avocado haha. They’re huge. I’m going to use the big one for guacamole. I’ll send photos or video when I cut it open.
16/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: que maravilla! y son baratos los aguacates ahi no? cuanto cuesta el kg?
16/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: acá como 5 euros ... tssss
16/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 0:43 - Lorena: Mucha gente sin trabajo ahora por covid, y el gobierno tenía que dar ayudas y aún no ingresaron dinero a todo el mundo
16/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 0:45 - Joe: Hahah good meme. It’s the same here. The aid has gone out but many are still waiting
16/5/20 0:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: Esta la primera vez que nos dijeron que teníamos que estar 15 días más encerrados jajajaja
16/5/20 0:47 - Joe: Mexican avocados are very expensive here. Cheap in California though. But the Hawaiian avocado you can get for free. Just find a tree somewhere or know someone that has some haha
16/5/20 0:47 - Joe: 😂
16/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: 👩‍🌾 agucates gratisss, que suertee
16/5/20 0:53 - Joe: This was me all day long when I worked in healthcare hahahah
16/5/20 0:55 - Joe: I worked in pharmacy and it felt like government approved drug dealing though haha especially in the area i worked. Lots of pain killers and stuff like that.
16/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Oh and I’m not sure what the avocados weigh 🤷‍♂️
16/5/20 5:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 5:53 - Lorena: Jajaja
16/5/20 5:55 - Lorena: Y cómo decidiste trabajar ahí, estudiaste algo de farmacia también?
16/5/20 5:56 - Lorena: Jaja, era cuánto dinero es el kilo de aguacate ahí en un supermercado.. acá 5euros
16/5/20 5:57 - Joe: Holaaa. buenos días! I just woke up from a nap haha confused as can be 😂
16/5/20 6:00 - Lorena: Jijij
16/5/20 6:00 - Joe: No worries about falling asleep. It’s too early. You need a few more hours haha. 


I studied to be a pharmacy technician. Like the assistant. I still have my license to work in the pharmacy but I kind of hated that job. Very miserable. 

Oh and I’ll check avocado prices next time I’m at the store. I don’t remember off the top of my head. 


Now get some more sleep haha
16/5/20 6:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 6:01 - Joe: Hahahahaha!!!
16/5/20 6:02 - Lorena: Jaja okey 🤷

16/5/20 6:04 - Joe: Ok then. Enjoy some more rest. Hit me up when you get up for real for real haha.
16/5/20 6:04 - Joe: 😘
16/5/20 6:07 - Lorena: Me voy a poner tapones los pájaros no paran de cantar y me despertaron
16/5/20 6:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:37 - Lorena: Jajaja
16/5/20 9:39 - Joe: Buenos días otra vez haha
16/5/20 9:39 - Joe: What are you up to today?
16/5/20 9:43 - Lorena: Jaja me desperté desconcertada antes
16/5/20 9:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:48 - Joe: Haha I like these. The pictures from Lore’s bed. A bed soooo far away 😂
16/5/20 9:48 - Lorena: Jajaja
16/5/20 9:49 - Lorena: Esto es lo primero que veo al despertar
16/5/20 9:50 - Joe: What do you use to sleep? Some ear plugs? Most birds don’t wake me, but there is one that is way too loud. It gets me every time. 

This is one place we are not alike haha. I wake up pretty easily. That’s ok though haha
16/5/20 9:50 - Lorena: Me encanta la planta, siempre la llevo cuando cambio de casa
16/5/20 9:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:52 - Joe: Haha it’s you’re little travel companion.
16/5/20 9:53 - Lorena: Jaja por eso, usa tapones! Te decía en el audio "normalmente no me molesta la luz ni los ruidos para dormir, pero de vez en cuando pruebo a usar tapones y cuando los uso, es increíble, duermo mejor, solo te concentras en dormir jaja, así que podrías probarlos vos que tenés el sueño raro"
16/5/20 9:53 - Joe: They have these all over here. Really big ones. Yours look well taken care of though. I know a bunch of chicks that got super into plants hahaha mostly my friends girlfriends but I see a lot of random plant related stuff because of that
16/5/20 9:54 - Lorena: Siiii! Y estos dos también
16/5/20 9:54 - Joe: Haha I heard most but i definitely missed the weird dream part. Interesting 🤔
16/5/20 9:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 9:57 - Joe: Those last two things are cute. I forgot all about dream catchers haha. Very cool though.
16/5/20 9:59 - Joe: I don’t think I have any cool stuff I bring everywhere. I need to get some stuff like that.
16/5/20 9:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 10:01 - Joe: what?? My friends, that are boys have girlfriends that like plants haha
16/5/20 10:02 - Lorena: Jaja no?? Seguro algo sí
16/5/20 10:03 - Joe: When I came to Hawaii I brought one suitcase full of clothes, my skateboard, and my computer. But all of that is replaceable non sentimental stuff.
16/5/20 10:03 - Joe: I don’t need much haha
16/5/20 10:05 - Joe: I mean, no necesito mucho
 
I should probably practice haha at least with my short sentences
16/5/20 10:06 - Lorena: Bueno el skate seguramente algo sentimental tenga
16/5/20 10:07 - Lorena: Yo puedo mudarme a cualquier lugar, pero necesito marcarlo con cosas mías jaja   me siento más cómoda
16/5/20 10:07 - Lorena: ✅
16/5/20 10:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 10:08 - Joe: I thing the concept and culture of skateboarding is sentimental but the board itself not so much haha
16/5/20 10:09 - Joe: Oh shit you’re right! I forgot about that. Probably because I just got it. Alright. That’s my first item 😂 😂 A fucking paddington bear

16/5/20 10:53 - Joe: I’m sure there are words like that in spanish. Some regular item that is super close to a bad word?
16/5/20 10:55 - Joe: Yeah they’re super similar. I’m not surprised either but it’s a good story haha
16/5/20 10:57 - Lorena: jajaja siempre que tenga que pronunciar alguna de esas palabras en publico, recordaré a tu abuela
16/5/20 10:58 - Lorena: yo siento que son muy parecidas, quiero decir... a vos si te escucho la diferencia, pero cuando yo lo pronuncio siento que es las dos suenas casi igual
16/5/20 11:02 - Joe: You know too much 🤫
16/5/20 11:02 - Joe: Haha I understand. There are words in Spanish that are like that to me. I’ll get a whole different meaning from a sentence because I misheard a word or two 😂
16/5/20 11:06 - Lorena: quería buscar en youtube algun video con palabras parecidas en español

16/5/20 11:45 - Joe: Hahaha I think that’s right
16/5/20 11:45 - Lorena: también se puede decir así!!!
16/5/20 11:46 - Joe: Aaah ok. So many ways to say things. That’s good though. When I finally learn I’ll have a lot more ways to describe what I’m feeling or thinking.
16/5/20 11:47 - Lorena: exacto, pero si decis cielo naranja te entiende la gente perfectamente, yo lo digo así..
16/5/20 11:47 - Lorena: sunset: atardecer
16/5/20 11:48 - Lorena: Where did you go?
16/5/20 11:50 - Joe: Target hahaha. My sister wanted to buy a bookshelf so she asked me to come so I could help her carry it. This was on the car ride over to the store.
16/5/20 11:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 11:53 - Lorena: hay un video que me encanta
16/5/20 11:54 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYp5xtkoF6M&t=20s
16/5/20 11:56 - Lorena: Look at it when you feel like it, the story of his grandma is incredible, the boy speaks super Spanish, 
mixes ENG and SPA
16/5/20 11:57 - Joe: Just clicked it and I already know I’m going to like it haha. I love videos about polyglots.


I used to watch this one guy go to places and surprise people by speaking to them in their language
16/5/20 11:57 - Joe: I’ll watch it now
16/5/20 11:58 - Lorena: okey, ahora me contás que te pareció! a mi me parece super inspirador y admirable!
16/5/20 12:05 - Joe: Damn I’m halfway through and this lady is already speaking hella languages at 25 hahaha. Boss lady
16/5/20 12:07 - Lorena: jajaja, a ella la necesidad hizo que aprenda un idioma, no paró de viajar
16/5/20 12:07 - Lorena: en cierto modo como tu abuela, aprendió un idioma, por necesidad de vivir en otro pais
16/5/20 12:07 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67XAq4vQywQ
16/5/20 12:08 - Lorena: I think you might like this one, this guy expresses himself super well
16/5/20 12:16 - Joe: lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el video del puño
16/5/20 12:17 - Joe: That lady is cool. And the guy knows a bunch of languages too. I’m trying to do that haha. We’ll see how it goes with spanish first haha
16/5/20 12:18 - Lorena: puño = 👊🏻
16/5/20 12:19 - Joe: Yeah that’s the best way to learn
16/5/20 12:19 - Lorena: si, los dos son geniales!
16/5/20 12:21 - Joe: Haha okey. lo siento, todavía estaba viendo el primer video.

???  🤔
16/5/20 12:22 - Joe: True!
16/5/20 12:23 - Lorena: si, primer video. puño, es puñetazo, golpe..fight
16/5/20 12:25 - Joe: Cool. Gracias. I’m just starting to watch the second video now. Is it about being introverted? I like this topic hahah I read a book called Introvert Power.
16/5/20 12:31 - Joe: Soooo yeah....I’m super introverted. And in the way he describes. That’s how the book explains it too. I’m drained by too many people and superficial relationships and energized by being alone or with someone I connect with on a deeper level. 

I only have my few close friends and that’s how I like it haha
16/5/20 12:34 - Joe: Wait....why did you decide to send me that? 

What are you trying to say about me here?


Also, how would you describe yourself in relation to what he was saying?
16/5/20 12:38 - Lorena: mmm.. te lo envié porque los videos de este chico me parecen interesantes, toca temas de los que ya hablamos, como idioma, y personalidad.. por lo que nos conocemos por acá, se podría decir que vos sos más introvertido y yo más extrovertida, pero al final yo creo que ahora, ambos estamos balanceados. Me pareció bueno, como el chico habló también de la personalidad de una persona introvertida, su visión, e incluso diferentes etapas de la vida en las que ejerces un rol diferente.
16/5/20 12:41 - Lorena: mi madre siempre me dijo que tuve mucho caracter, aunque en el colegio, tenia una personalidad más introvertida.. no sé hasta que punto, pero recuerdo que era más tímida, a partir de los 15 años, todo eso se esfumó sin darme cuenta.
16/5/20 12:42 - Joe: Yeah that video was relatable. I enjoy our balance for sure haha there’s something really nice about it that makes it fun
16/5/20 12:43 - Joe: You’re definitely a character haha. I can’t imagine you being very shy but that’s interesting to know.
16/5/20 12:45 - Lorena: Por ejemplo, el trabajo donde estamos con Sandra, fue un proceso de selección de entrevista individual y grupal, y luego hicimos un viaje a Barcelona, para formación todo el equipo. Sandra era suuuuuuper timida,  y yo polo opuesto, ni nos hablamos durante entrevista, yo cree vinculo con otras personas más activas, y luego al final, trabajando, empezamos a charlar diferentes cosas, y ahora es la persona con la que mejor me llevo. A día de hoy, hablamos de eso y nos parece curioso como al final llegamos a el punto, incluso vivir juntas
16/5/20 12:45 - Lorena: jajaja yo... blablabla .. sorry
16/5/20 12:46 - Joe: Don’t be sorry. Tell me everything
16/5/20 12:50 - Joe: Hahaha you have a way of connecting with the shy introverts. Must have some good vibes
16/5/20 12:54 - Joe: Send more thoughts my way whenever you want. I really do want to hear it all.
16/5/20 12:54 - Joe: But right now I’m tired haha so I’m going to bed
16/5/20 12:56 - Joe: I think we covered a lot of ground today hahah some good stuff 😂 

Anyway, I’ll talk to you later. Have a beautiful day 😘
16/5/20 13:01 - Lorena: jajaja no sé, me encanta hacer vinculos con todo el mundo, incluso con una hormiga que pase por al lado mio.. jajaja pero tengo que reconocer, que me atrae cuando alguien es introvertido, quiero romper esa barrera y que conmigo sea una persona más abierta, no sé jaja no sé si entenderás esto..
16/5/20 13:02 - Lorena: claro... durante tu día todo fue más intenso, más cosas, mi día de ayer fue politica, hoy idiomas y "psicología"
16/5/20 13:02 - Lorena: sleep super well, next night, with plugs! a kiss !!!
16/5/20 13:06 - Joe: Haha I understand. 


Now that you’ve broken my barrier I kind of wish you weren’t so far away though 😂 

K, talk to you later
16/5/20 13:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/5/20 13:08 - Lorena: jajaja, si te encanta decirlo yo creo...

16/5/20 20:33 - Joe: My handwriting is so bad hahaha. By the way, random fact, I’m left handed haha
16/5/20 20:37 - Joe: It was a good lesson though. She was telling me about how she speaks a different Spanish than they do in Mexico. Probably more like from Spain. She said it would be “Castellano” o “Castilian”


She also told me about some crazy gold mountains and a recent discovery of an ancient civilization that was bigger than Manchu Picchu and now I really want to go to Peru and see what she is talking about
16/5/20 20:41 - Lorena: Jajajaja

16/5/20 23:12 - Lorena: Esas notas fue lo que hablaste con ella?
16/5/20 23:14 - Lorena: Quiero saberlo todo contamelooo
16/5/20 23:17 - Joe: Hah yeah those notes are what we’ve been talking about. And then after the lesson she will tell me about how people in my family speak Spanish. She said my aunt and uncle are ok but they get lazy and don’t speak Spanish enough then lose it but apparently my dad is the best at speaking haha.
16/5/20 23:18 - Joe: She is trying to make me talk to him in spanish to practice. But for now we go over what we would say to each other in the morning. Greetings, about breakfast and coffee ahah, and today we talked about going for a walk and just what we would see
16/5/20 23:19 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
16/5/20 23:19 - Lorena: Jaja son tiernas las notas de español jajajaja
16/5/20 23:20 - Joe: It’s good practice. She talks to me really slow most of the time haha. It’s fun though, we talk for about an hour each morning to practice
16/5/20 23:21 - Lorena: Jaja pero hoy es el primer día? O ya hablabas con ella antes en español?
16/5/20 23:22 - Lorena: No le dijiste aún a tu padre que hablas español? Jaja el es el mejor según tu abuela jajja

16/5/20 23:23 - Lorena: Tu abuela es la que te dice que estás despeinado, en pijama, que te quiere
16/5/20 23:23 - Joe: We started a few days ago. I usually only speak to her in English
16/5/20 23:23 - Lorena: Y ella cansada, miedo( supongo que por corona) etc jaja
16/5/20 23:24 - Lorena: O igual me lo estoy inventado yo jajaja

17/5/20 0:21 - Joe: Haha yeah it sounds “ea” sounds like spanish “i”. And the “i” sometimes sounds like spanish “e” but sometimes sound like the word “ay”
17/5/20 0:22 - Joe: English is hard to learn I’ve heard
17/5/20 0:23 - Lorena: ay dios.. jaja nuestras conversaciones.... mi "i" mi "e".. tu "e" como ay... por otro lado... mi mañana tu noche, mi noche tu tarde.. jajajaja
17/5/20 0:23 - Joe: Because it doesn’t make sense. Spanish has a lot of ways to say things but mostly follows a smaller set of rules than English.
17/5/20 0:23 - Joe: Hahahah
17/5/20 0:24 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/B-495q2Isry/?igshid=xrae6dw99968
17/5/20 0:25 - Joe: Our conversations are kind of weird but it’s interesting. Learning about the differences directly from someone across the globe
17/5/20 0:26 - Lorena: si jajaj es genial!!
17/5/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 0:27 - Lorena: jajajaajaja
17/5/20 0:27 - Joe: https://youtu.be/BQ4c54rCJ_k
17/5/20 0:29 - Lorena: jajajajajaja
17/5/20 0:30 - Joe: Hahahah that video makes me laugh every time. Ooh it’s too good
17/5/20 0:30 - Lorena: AY que bueno sigo riendome jajajaja cada vez que escucho el original y suena asi
17/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: al parecer, la rubia esa... es Youtuber, como vos .. jajajajaja
17/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: y ella hace un monton de videos, su novio es mexicano creo.. vi alguno y pfff... es muy pija tonta..
17/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ZWBllAI9hFTGpCT6fYcYQ
17/5/20 0:33 - Joe: Hahah YouTuber like me hahah
17/5/20 0:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 0:35 - Lorena: ajajajajaajajajaja
17/5/20 0:35 - Lorena: me encanta
17/5/20 0:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 0:38 - Joe: I better watch my back around you 😂
17/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: jjajaja lo siento, pero si
17/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: soy fan del canguro
17/5/20 0:46 - Joe: Haha alright for sure
17/5/20 0:46 - Joe: I thought for a second you love the idea of kicking me into a pond hahaha
17/5/20 0:47 - Joe: Maybe save that for when you get really mad at me. 

Which reminds me...question...what are you like when you get mad?? Haha
17/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: uououo yo enojada?
17/5/20 0:49 - Lorena: de verdad querés saberlo? jajaja
17/5/20 0:51 - Joe: Hahah yeah for sure. You can be honest. If you have a lot of passion when you’re angry that’s ok. I would rather have honesty and learn to work with the kind of person you really are than to have you try and hide it
17/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: jajaa yo no oculto nada, soy bastante transparente con la gente que me conoce... mmm
17/5/20 0:54 - Lorena: me considero una persona con carácter, cada vez que algo no me gusta o no es justo, lo digo, rara vez me callo. Me suelo llevar bien con la gente, me gusta hacer bromas, ayudar, compartir, pero si es una persona interesada, egoista, toxica... no me interesa en absoluto, y cuando alguien no me interesa puedo ser "mala"
17/5/20 0:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: en cuanto a enojarme,con amigas o familiares, etc...puede que me altere un poco, depende.. pero no me duran los enfados demasiado, siempre confio en el dialogo, la comunicación...
17/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: jajajaja mierda
17/5/20 0:58 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll believe you. Communication is definitely the key. Which makes this hard 😂 

But people can communicate a lot with actions as well I guess
17/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: mmm jaja intento ser objetiva en la respuesta, aunque es dificil describirse, depende la época, situación, persona, etc...
17/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: y vos, que? eh eh eh
17/5/20 1:04 - Joe: Hahah eh eh eh

I’m very calm for the most part. I try to work situations out or just walk away and come back to it later. Depends. I’ve had my moments of getting very angry when I was younger for sure but as I got older I’ve become less worried about the things that upset me
17/5/20 1:06 - Joe: pinochio siempre me recordará a ti ahora
17/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: 💙
17/5/20 1:15 - Joe: Hahaha I’m definitely turning into an old hippie. That’s why those old hippies gave me free weed. The felt the vibe
17/5/20 1:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:16 - Lorena: jajaja seguro, no tuvieron duda de ello
17/5/20 1:17 - Lorena: me encantan los niños que se crian con animales!
17/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: https://www.facebook.com/thedodosite/videos/1384411811693490/
17/5/20 1:22 - Joe: Haha yeah it’s pretty cool when kids grow up with animals. 

That video was so good haha. Little Jimmy the pig 🐖
17/5/20 1:26 - Lorena: jijiii
17/5/20 1:26 - Lorena: por momentos creo que me gustaría vivir en un lugar como una granja, jaja que paz
17/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: que hacessss pinocho??? tengo una solicitud!
17/5/20 1:29 - Lorena: graba un video, de unos segundos.. diciendome algo, a ver si entiendo y asi te veo! jajaja
17/5/20 1:30 - Joe: Hahahaha like what? In English? Cause I can’t tell you much in spanish ahaha
17/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: si en inglés jaja, poco a poco ...
17/5/20 1:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:38 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what to say but there you go
17/5/20 1:40 - Joe: God I hate my voice 😆
17/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: Okey creo que elegí el gif más cursi de todos jajaja
17/5/20 1:46 - Joe: Hahaha cheese me up 😂
17/5/20 1:46 - Joe: I accept your cheesy gif haha
17/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: Cheese? Queso?
17/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: Jaja cursi no?
17/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Mañana te haré alguna pregunta , si te entendí si hablas despacio aunque tendría que escuchar bien alguna parte jaja
17/5/20 1:49 - Joe: Aah yeah corny/cheesy same meaning in English when you use it that way. But ok sounds good, prepare your questions. I’ll try to keep my answer short.
17/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Hahahahaha fuck
17/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Didneoskezjfos
17/5/20 1:54 - Joe: How do I get you here now!? Hahahaha damn. Oh well. That’s life
17/5/20 1:58 - Lorena: Jajajaja
17/5/20 1:59 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️ 

https://youtu.be/TnlPtaPxXfc
17/5/20 2:02 - Lorena: Me gusta Frank Sinatra , mi abuela siempre me hizo escucharlo de pequeña
17/5/20 2:04 - Lorena: Bueno Joe, me voy a dormir. Creo que esta noche "soñaré" con vos jajaja lo intentaré... Ya te contaré si merece la pena 😂
17/5/20 2:06 - Joe: Aw I Ike that haha. I might get stuck in your dream catcher though 😊
17/5/20 2:06 - Joe: I like that**

Buenas noches 😘
17/5/20 2:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 10:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 11:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 11:06 - Joe: Taaaaaaaardeeeee
17/5/20 11:08 - Joe: Mmmm looks good. I love coffee haha. Hawaii has hella good coffee. That Kona coffee 😂
17/5/20 11:22 - Lorena: jjj 😊
17/5/20 11:22 - Lorena: y que hacessss??
17/5/20 11:24 - Lorena: jugamos?
17/5/20 11:26 - Joe: I’m laying in bed listening to music 🎶
17/5/20 11:28 - Joe: Haha what? You trying to play something?
17/5/20 11:32 - Lorena: honecode
17/5/20 11:32 - Lorena: jaja pero lo cerré, otro día si querés si ahora estas tranquilo en tu cama jaja
17/5/20 11:35 - Joe: Aw whaaat? Nah we can play haha. I can lay in bed and play at the same time 😂
17/5/20 11:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 11:49 - Lorena: voyyyperdón que estaba escuchando unos audios de una amiga q son infinitos jaja
17/5/20 11:51 - Joe: Aaah Ok.  Sooo do we play then? I’m feeling lucky. Going to win all the matches
17/5/20 12:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 12:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 12:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 12:44 - Joe: Hahahahaha
17/5/20 12:44 - Lorena: Joe, te voy a decir una cosa
17/5/20 12:44 - Lorena: y leela bien jajaja
17/5/20 12:45 - Joe: Now I’m watching about analysis paralysis again 😂
17/5/20 12:45 - Lorena: Joe, I really want to fuck you ( aprendiendo la otra parte de la lección 🙄)
17/5/20 12:45 - Joe: 😮
17/5/20 12:46 - Lorena: jajjajaa
17/5/20 12:46 - Lorena: 🙊
17/5/20 12:47 - Joe: You get an A+ for that lesson. I don’t even need the audio hahaha
17/5/20 12:47 - Joe: But I’ll take it if you want to send it 😆
17/5/20 12:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 12:49 - Lorena: " Si claro te lo digo, no sé si sonará tan bien.."
17/5/20 12:50 - Joe: Sounded verrrrry good hahaha
17/5/20 12:52 - Joe: Much better than when I say it in spanish. Shit, it sounds better coming from you in English than me in English 😂
17/5/20 12:53 - Lorena: será por que yo tengo más ganas/interés jajaja
17/5/20 12:54 - Joe: Pfffff
17/5/20 12:56 - Joe: I’m just shy hahaha It’s not a phrase I would use often 😂 

It suits you well haha
17/5/20 12:58 - Lorena: mmm I'm not shy, but I don't use it often for anyone either
17/5/20 12:58 - Joe: Haha that probably sounds weird. But I just mean you sound good when you say it
17/5/20 12:59 - Joe: Haha sorry, I wasn’t trying to imply that you do
17/5/20 13:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 13:09 - Lorena: que asco de gente
17/5/20 13:10 - Lorena: la sociedad es super egoista
17/5/20 13:10 - Lorena: acabo de terminar de ver el video, muy interesante. gracias!
17/5/20 13:12 - Joe: Haha dude you have no idea how bad the US has been with all this do you?
17/5/20 13:14 - Joe: We basically fucked the whole response and it’s been like this for most of the time with people not listening. But in different places across the country at different times.
17/5/20 13:14 - Joe: Then we have weird enforcement where police will patrol poor neighborhoods and keep them on a much more serious lockdown than the rich neighborhoods
17/5/20 13:15 - Lorena: tsssss
17/5/20 13:16 - Joe: It’s the worst. Especially in places like New York
17/5/20 13:16 - Lorena: gente ignorante no se divide por clases sociales, si uno es más rico o más pobre
17/5/20 13:16 - Lorena: hay gente tomando decisiones muy malas, que afectan a todos, incluso mundialmente
17/5/20 13:17 - Joe: Yeah but the police let the rich gather in their parks and literally beat and arrest the poor for being outside in their neighborhoods
17/5/20 13:17 - Lorena: puto ascooo
17/5/20 13:18 - Joe: It’s so weird to see a video of cops assaulting someone for being outside without a mask...instead of maybe just giving them a mask
17/5/20 13:18 - Joe: It doesn’t make sense cause now there are a bunch of cops touching this person to arrest them
17/5/20 13:19 - Joe: They should be distancing themselves not touching people. Shits crazy
17/5/20 13:19 - Lorena: no tiene sentido, pero siempre la policia abusa de poder...
17/5/20 13:19 - Joe: True
17/5/20 13:20 - Lorena: acá en la ciudad se ve de todo, mucha gente corriendo sin mascarilla.. es incomoda? si, pero hay que intentar llevarla.. por que un día se puede contagiar alguien de tu familia, o la gente no tendrá como vivir por la falta de trabajo, creo que hay gente que no es consciente de esta situación
17/5/20 13:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 13:22 - Joe: Hahaha
17/5/20 13:23 - Joe: Yeah that’s what made one of the videos of a cop arresting someone for not having a mask so ridiculous. A few of the officers were wearing there mask like that haha
17/5/20 13:25 - Joe: It’s impossible to get 100% of the humans to believe it all and to actively participate in keeping everyone safe. Some people just don’t trust sources of authority telling them what to do
17/5/20 13:27 - Lorena: yo tampoco confio mucho, pero intento tener respeto y consideración, es algo temporal, y tenemos que recuperar la normalidad... yo no lo estoy pasando mal, no me falta comida, ni me aburro, hago cosas, estoy sana, etc... pero no paro de pensar en que hay gente que si, que debe estar pasando una muy mala situación, y hay que ser un poquito responsable y tener empatía...
17/5/20 13:29 - Joe: Yeah the more we have stuff like that picture, the longer it will take to go to normal
17/5/20 13:30 - Joe: Hopefully there are more people doing the right thing than the wrong thing. Around here most wear their mask and keep their distance. Beaches are mostly empty but I think they are starting to open them this week.
17/5/20 13:31 - Joe: Oh and tell me what you thought about the video. I watched it again hahaha I forgot how old that video is
17/5/20 13:33 - Lorena: Si ahí por lo que me muestras, no hay gente parece... acá mucha... yo no sé si en algún momento me contagiaré... cada vez que salgo es inevitable mantener la distancia, como zombies en una ciudad, hay muchas personas para las calles..
17/5/20 13:34 - Lorena: Si, me pareció interesante el análisis, y el resultado, no había pensado en ello. La historia del Jean y el médico es muy real.. jaja
17/5/20 13:36 - Joe: Yeah it seems a little weirder being in a bigger city. It’ll be an adjustment going back to California. There are a lot of people in the Bay Area.
17/5/20 13:37 - Lorena: es como que tenemos una presión a decidir bien, y no fracasar. Hay gente que no lo toma tan serio, no da demasiada importancia. Yo tomo notas, cuando tengo que tomar decisiones, necesito hacer esquema o listas, pros y contras, y así lo veo mucho más claro, hay veces que me funciona jajaja
17/5/20 13:37 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I especially liked the medicine story. Doctors giving the patients the choice even though the doctor has the knowledge and the way medications are marketed
17/5/20 13:37 - Lorena: Volvés al final, dónde vas a vivir, en lo de tus padres?
17/5/20 13:38 - Lorena: Si, pero totalmente cierto... esperamos que otra persona decida, ya que se supone que tiene mejores conocimientos.. entonces nos relajamos y esa decisión no es nuestra
17/5/20 13:39 - Joe: I don’t know....and I only have 3 weeks to find out. I might have a friend I can stay with if I can’t find anything.
17/5/20 13:39 - Lorena: y vos que haces a la hora de tomar decisiones, te cuesta o utilizas alguna tecnica?
17/5/20 13:41 - Joe: 🤔 when I pick something I do a lot of research if it’s an expensive item. 
If it’s something like choosing which bread from the store, I don’t know haha
17/5/20 13:43 - Joe: Usually I just get the same thing every time once I find something I like. Then I don’t have to choose
17/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: hay algo que te costó más tiempo en decidir, decisiones de vida? o algo a día de hoy, que no tengas claro que decisión tomar?
17/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: mmm es tarde ahi, si querés me lo contas en otro momento u otro día!
17/5/20 13:51 - Joe: Haha yeah I’m going to bed soon. But um...just deciding what to do with my life hahaha
I don’t know how to explain it
17/5/20 13:51 - Joe: Like my decision where to live, who to be, what things do I want to be able to say I’ve done when my life is over. The hard stuff haha
17/5/20 13:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 13:56 - Lorena: estamos en la edad de tener que elegir todas estas cosas! jaja
17/5/20 13:56 - Lorena: supuuuuestamente... jjj
17/5/20 13:57 - Lorena: jajaja que duermas muy bien, muak! 😘
17/5/20 13:57 - Joe: Hahaha yeah we are 😂 


Ok. I’ll talk to you later. Have a good day 😘
17/5/20 20:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 20:28 - Joe: 😂 I tried to send that like an hour ago but it never sent. But now I’m up!!
17/5/20 20:28 - Joe: I wanted to send you this link so you can see how stupid Americans are in real time hahah

https://www.fox29.com/ocean-city-webcam
17/5/20 20:30 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
17/5/20 20:31 - Lorena: Buenos días!!!
17/5/20 20:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 20:52 - Lorena: Jajajaj
17/5/20 20:52 - Lorena: Dormí un poquito más!!
17/5/20 21:05 - Joe: Aaaaah I have to get out of this bed!
17/5/20 21:05 - Joe: How was your day? Did you get to do anything today?
17/5/20 22:44 - Lorena: Eyyyy
17/5/20 22:46 - Lorena: Perdona estaba en la calle con Luchi
17/5/20 22:53 - Joe: No problem. I was out too, getting some sun
17/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 22:57 - Joe: Haha with the scissors still in hand. Did you find those and cut them?
17/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Haha I’m going to have to listen to that a bunch of times to get the whole thing but don’t translate it. I’ll use it to practice haha
17/5/20 22:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 23:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 23:07 - Joe: Hahaha so I got the part about your friend and the nickname 😂 and that you went to see your friend and went for a long walk with the dog. The dog is super good? Haha
17/5/20 23:09 - Joe: And you are getting a lot of flowers in nature because there are no gardeners hahah. Very nice.
17/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/5/20 23:10 - Joe: Sweet. There are still a bunch of words I miss or don’t understand but I can get barely enough to make a story in my head about what you say 😂
18/5/20 0:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Cuando termine de cenar
18/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Te escribo lo que te dije
18/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Así podés escuchar y leerlo
18/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Y aprender esas palabras que no sabes okey?
18/5/20 0:12 - Joe: Yeah that’ll be good. Enjoy dinner. I’m waiting for “Lahaina noon” where the sun is directly overhead and vertical objects have no shadow.
18/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: Que? No entendí nada de eso
18/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: De lahaiana Moon
18/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: Noon
18/5/20 0:15 - Joe: Hmm I don’t have a link in spanish but I have this Wikipedia link 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina_Noon
18/5/20 0:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Basically it’s when you are at the “sub solar point” or the point directly under the sun. Hawaii is the only place on land that it happens in the US.
18/5/20 0:19 - Joe: Damn the clouds are going to ruin it 😡
18/5/20 0:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: Cangu ya estoy!
18/5/20 1:24 - Lorena: no sabía de ese fenomeno, que fuuuuuerte!
18/5/20 1:24 - Joe: Haha alright send me today’s lesson
18/5/20 1:24 - Lorena: ví un video también como no se ven las sombras
18/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: y vos hiciste la foto justo en el momento!
18/5/20 1:26 - Joe: You watched a video about it? 

Yeah I’m glad I got to see it. I heard about this a long time ago.
18/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: Siii, de un hombre que pone varios objetos y justo ocurre, lo graba y solo se ve su sombra pero el resto no
18/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: un video muy corto para ver que era jaja
18/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: mmm la lección si, cierto!
18/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: voy a ver que te dije que no me acuerdo exactamente jajajaja
18/5/20 1:30 - Lorena: "un poquito de español, lento... mi amiga se llama Lucia pero su apodo es Luchi, y la fui a acompañar un poco, porque ella vive como a mm 30, 20, 25 minutos de casa caminando. Quedamos a las 8 y estuvimos caminando hasta ahora que son las 11 de la noche, dimos una vuelta con Rogel que es el perro y super bienn"
18/5/20 1:30 - Lorena: te lo escribí exacto
18/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: 2 audio "parezco estupida diciendo "apodo" se dice apodo, normal" ( en el audio anterior te lo intenté decir lento pero fue demasiado jajaja
18/5/20 1:32 - Joe: Hahah gracias!
18/5/20 1:32 - Joe: My own personal subtitles 😂
18/5/20 1:32 - Lorena: la naturaleza esta salvaje ahora, las plantas... no hay jardineros trabajando entonces esta toda la ciudad llena de plantas, arbustos, flores.. porque es primavera y esta super lindo, los bancos, las barandillas, todo.. todo esta lleno de plantas"
18/5/20 1:33 - Lorena: jaja para que veas...como te cuido eh eh!!!
18/5/20 1:34 - Joe: Hahaha I really appreciate it. You’ve helped me improve a lot so that’s cool
18/5/20 1:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:36 - Joe: Alright I’m going to read your subtitles a couple of times and then listen again and see how much more I can hear
18/5/20 1:37 - Lorena: bien, acá estaré por si me necesitas!
18/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: de nada, encantada! 😙
18/5/20 1:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:44 - Joe: Hahaha that’s gif is weird
18/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: jajajaja
18/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: yo ví tu video varias veces
18/5/20 1:46 - Joe: Oh from this morning? Hahaha

It’s late there now but tomorrow you still have to ask those questions for me to give video answers
18/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: no, el otro que me grabaste hablando
18/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: jaja el de esta mañana me hizo gracia lo ví en la calle!
18/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Hahaha you would probably enjoy not being able to understand me. Just nod and go “mhmm” or “no” and see what happens 😂
18/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: jaja si te entendí, casi todo. pero no podía parar de mirar esos rulos sexys
18/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Hahahahaha naaaaaaah
18/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: jajaajajajaja
18/5/20 1:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 1:55 - Joe: Making me nervous
18/5/20 1:55 - Lorena: JAJAJA
18/5/20 1:55 - Lorena: es que cuanto más nervioso te pones, más gracia me hace
18/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: nunca seguís el juego, pero espero que no te sientas incomodo o te moleste
18/5/20 1:58 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t know how to play but I think it’s fine. I like the discomfort. It’s more from not being used to getting compliments and literally not knowing how to respond 😂
18/5/20 1:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: te sentís incómodo cuando te digo alguna de estas cosas?
18/5/20 2:02 - Joe: If I do it’s not in a bad way. Don’t second guess how you’re talking to me...I think everything you’ve said has been fine
18/5/20 2:03 - Joe: If there is something I don’t like I’ll let you know. It’s not a big deal. But like I said, so far so good
18/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: jaja okey, me alegro que así sea entonces!
18/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: Y si nos vemos en persona algun día, y te hago algún cumplido? jaja que harás, serás nº7 también?
18/5/20 2:09 - Lorena: tendrás que practicarlo jaja
18/5/20 2:12 - Joe: Haha I don’t know what i would do 😂 

I’ve always been told I’m bad at taking compliments. I think i usually try to make a joke about it if you haven’t noticed
18/5/20 2:13 - Joe: So I would probably joke about whatever compliment you give me then compliment you I guess 🤔 

I’m not super smooth hahahahaha
18/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 2:15 - Lorena: jajaja si, me dí cuenta..!
18/5/20 2:16 - Joe: Hahahaha fuck
18/5/20 2:16 - Lorena: jajaja esta bien saberlo!! 🤔
18/5/20 2:16 - Joe: Well what do normal people do?? Am I weird for that?
18/5/20 2:17 - Lorena: mmm jaja no
18/5/20 2:17 - Lorena: esta bien, no pasa nada!
18/5/20 2:20 - Joe: Haha alright if you say so. I’ll just keep being my weird self since it seems to be working fine
18/5/20 2:21 - Joe: I wish you could just have subtitles everywhere you went because I can understand you so much better with subtitles 😂 😂
18/5/20 2:22 - Lorena: hasta ahora si! jaja
18/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: mmm que me querés decir? 😂
18/5/20 2:26 - Joe: So you can meet me sooner and I’ll understand you. You would have a little screen that shows subtitles for everything you say and you bring it everywhere hahah 

I’m better at reading Spanish than listening to it for now
18/5/20 2:27 - Joe: But I’m just kidding. I’m figuring this shit out. Going to be sooo good at spanish. Just give it time.
18/5/20 2:29 - Lorena: jajaja si nos viesemos ahora, seríamos como mimos
18/5/20 2:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 2:31 - Lorena: Uoooo bieeeen ahí! 💪💪
18/5/20 2:34 - Joe: Hahaha I’ll be ok with that 😂
18/5/20 2:37 - Joe: Mimes have excellent communication skills. Most communication is done with body language and nobody communicates with the body better than mimes haha
18/5/20 2:37 - Joe: Also, less of a chance for me to say something stupid that way 😆
18/5/20 2:38 - Lorena: Jajajaja
18/5/20 2:39 - Lorena: 🤐🤐🤐 no diré nada al respecto jajaja
18/5/20 2:40 - Lorena: Escucharía todas 😉
18/5/20 2:42 - Lorena: Bueno, me voy a dormirrr se me cierran los ojitos 😴 hablamos luego!!
18/5/20 2:42 - Lorena: Unbeeeso hone
18/5/20 2:42 - Joe: Oook talk to later. Buenas noches

18/5/20 19:42 - Joe: Hahaha!
18/5/20 19:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 19:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 19:44 - Lorena: Ñoquis con tuco
18/5/20 19:45 - Lorena: Pregúntale si en Perú también se pone dinero abajo del plato los 29 de cada mes
18/5/20 19:59 - Joe: Hahaha whaaaat? I just got off the phone before I read this. I’ll ask tomorrow. I’ve never heard of this though 😂 

Also what is “ñoquis”?
18/5/20 20:01 - Joe: Haha dammit I just listened to the audio too. I’ll say it tomorrow after you tell me what it means haha
18/5/20 20:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:04 - Lorena: Hay una tradición en Uruguay, que día 29 de cada mes, se pone un billete o moneda debajo del plato, y se supone que da suerte... atraé dinero y cosas buenas jajaja
18/5/20 20:04 - Joe: Aaah ok. Yeah she was saying not everyone uses the word tuco but she uses it a lot
18/5/20 20:04 - Lorena: También se hace en Argentina, no sé si en Perú
18/5/20 20:04 - Lorena: pero también es por nuestra descendencia italiana
18/5/20 20:06 - Lorena: Exacto, en mi familia se usa la palabra tuco, pero en España no.. acá es salsa de tomate simplemente jaja
18/5/20 20:06 - Joe: Sounds like something I could get into. I’m trying to attract money and good things haha
18/5/20 20:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:07 - Joe: Oh this is random but I got so bored yesterday I took a personality test hahaha 

Results were interesting 😂
18/5/20 20:07 - Lorena: jajaja ñoquis con tuco
18/5/20 20:08 - Lorena: Ah si? y eso?? quiero ver los resultados jaja
18/5/20 20:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:13 - Joe: If it’s in English, there is a setting to change languages 

https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality
18/5/20 20:13 - Joe: If you get bored toy can take it and let me know how it goes haha
18/5/20 20:13 - Joe: You* can take it
18/5/20 20:16 - Lorena: jajaja hablas tan rapido las palabras en español que no te entiendo, estas ya a nivel profesional nativo ajjaja
18/5/20 20:16 - Lorena: tomar café jajaj
18/5/20 20:16 - Lorena: decís que hoy fue un mal día, no entendias mucho?
18/5/20 20:16 - Joe: Hahaha fuck. More like I say them so badly that you can’t understand hahah shit
18/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: no dije mal, dije rápido
18/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: RÁ PI DO
18/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: jajaja
18/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: ahora voy a escucharlas y te voy a decir si estan bien
18/5/20 20:18 - Joe: Yeah. My brain was just working slow today. She would say a long sentence to me and my brain would stop listening halfway through cause I’m still translating the beginning in my head.
18/5/20 20:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:20 - Lorena: "No entiendo una puta mierda" Así te descargas mejor jaja
18/5/20 20:21 - Joe: Hahaha
18/5/20 20:21 - Lorena: dulce!
18/5/20 20:21 - Lorena: No pasa nada, habrá días mejores.. aunque esta bien dicho lo que dijiste
18/5/20 20:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:23 - Lorena: jajajaja bien bien!!!!
18/5/20 20:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:24 - Lorena: 2 segundos, muy rápido .. jaja que vas a usar la frase con tu abuela? jajaja
18/5/20 20:24 - Joe: That’s hella sweet of you hahaha I appreciate it. Personal video lessons haha
18/5/20 20:24 - Lorena: no creo que le guste a tu abuela lo que te enseño, mejor no jajaja
18/5/20 20:25 - Joe: Hahahaha I said “I will use it, but not with my grandma” 😂 

Yeah she wouldn’t be too stoked on that haha
18/5/20 20:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:26 - Lorena: 🤐🤐🤐
18/5/20 20:26 - Lorena: Un 10!
18/5/20 20:27 - Lorena: Que más aprendiste?
18/5/20 20:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:29 - Joe: Not much. Today was bad haha. We just went over greeting in the morning and a pretend walk again.
18/5/20 20:31 - Joe: She was telling me a lot of learning strategies today. Like put stickers with the spanish word for the item on things around the house. She said watch tv and movies with spanish subtitles so I can see what they are saying and train my ear better even if I don’t necessarily understand
18/5/20 20:32 - Joe: Listen closely to the movies or shows and write down words I don’t understand and look them up in the dictionary
18/5/20 20:32 - Lorena: jajaja muy bien! esta lección bien aprendida, es importante
18/5/20 20:33 - Lorena: no puedo creer... que tu abuela te de tácticas y no le digas que estas hablando español todos los días con una persona jajajaja
18/5/20 20:33 - Lorena: de todos modos, me parece buena idea las tácticas que te dice
18/5/20 20:35 - Lorena: " no puedo creer" es como una manera de decir.. mmm no puedo creer.. jajaja que dificil es explicarlo
18/5/20 20:37 - Joe: Hahaha I’m going to tell her. I just don’t know when 😂 


I don’t tell anyone much about my life haha
18/5/20 20:37 - Joe: Even my family
18/5/20 20:38 - Lorena: ahaaa
18/5/20 20:38 - Lorena: jaja bueno
18/5/20 20:39 - Joe: Haha I doubt you’re telling anyone about me 😂 

It’s just the way I am though. I don’t know why I don’t like telling people what’s happening with me 🤷‍♂️
18/5/20 20:40 - Lorena: jaja
18/5/20 20:40 - Lorena: te equivocas
18/5/20 20:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:42 - Joe: I’ve mentioned you to my two closest friends but that’s it haha.
18/5/20 20:43 - Joe: Their minds were blown. They couldn’t imagine it 😂
18/5/20 20:44 - Lorena: todas mis amigas lo saben, jaja hablo con casi todas siempre y no puedo ocultarlo, yo les cuento casi todo jajaja
18/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: también lo conté para que me digan... "lore, es una locura.." pero esa no fue la respuesta de ninguna, bueno solo de una jajaja
18/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: Jaja y que te dijeron?
18/5/20 20:48 - Joe: Hahaha they wouldn’t talk you out of it?? You must not have told them enough about me yet 😂
18/5/20 20:52 - Joe: Mostly “Whaaaaat!? Hahaha, you’re always doing something hella cutty” which is kind of like saying that I’m always doing stuff without many knowing. And they talked about how I’m always doing the opposite of what they’re doing in life haha ever since high school
18/5/20 20:53 - Joe: But they were stoked on it. A little concerned that I might leave the Bay Area for good but they know wherever I go they’re welcome to visit so it’s bittersweet I guess
18/5/20 20:57 - Lorena: Your defense weapon, the joke.. jaja todas me dijeron que me vayan si quiero, y que era bonita "la historia" jajaja
18/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: jajaja como por ejemplo, cosas que no se imaginan, eso lo contrario?
18/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: ohhhh jaja sii!!!
18/5/20 21:03 - Joe: Well when I first told them about you I said I was considering trying to see you. Maybe in Spain. They all traveled internationally without me a few years back. I was too busy working to go. Now it’s the opposite, I have time to travel and they’re all very busy. 

And now I’m single, talking to some girl from across the world, and they all have girlfriends. But like i told you, I had a few very long term relationships, all while my friends were single hahaha. They all had long crazy hair in high school, i stayed clean cut.
18/5/20 21:03 - Joe: Now I’m a mess and they’re all clean cut haha. I don’t know. I’m just always doing my own thing
18/5/20 21:04 - Lorena: jajaja a contracorriente
18/5/20 21:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:06 - Joe: I must take some kind of pride in being “different” because I’ve always been this way haha.
18/5/20 21:06 - Joe: Basically Hahahaha
18/5/20 21:06 - Joe: I didn’t even notice until my friends pointed it out though
18/5/20 21:06 - Lorena: Si, me gusta lo diferente!
18/5/20 21:07 - Lorena: jajaja es genial cuando nuestros amigos, dan sus opiniones
18/5/20 21:08 - Joe: For sure. Especially these dudes. I’ve been friends with them since I was 12 haha so they know me well and can tell me things I don’t notice about my own personality
18/5/20 21:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:14 - Lorena: si es genial, bueno tengo que reconocer que me gusta que lo hayas contado jajaja
18/5/20 21:14 - Lorena: vaaamos! bien ahi
18/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: estoy dentro!
18/5/20 21:16 - Lorena: ay que te ibas a patinar, jaja perdón
18/5/20 21:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:17 - Joe: Haha yeah but we’ll play later! The sound makes it better for sure
18/5/20 21:18 - Joe: The mini detail will make the project look much better in the eyes of a recruiter or potential client if I show it to them. It still feels unfinished to me. I’m working on adding the gifs next hahaha
18/5/20 21:18 - Joe: We need them
18/5/20 21:18 - Joe: I’m learning so much in quarantine 😂
18/5/20 21:23 - Lorena: well I'm glad so! You have a lot of potential to show, and of course this quarantine in Hawaii is being useful!
18/5/20 21:23 - Lorena: I'm going to feel sorry when I'm done and I don't see Hawaii videos anymore haha
18/5/20 21:25 - Lorena: disfruta muucho del paseo en skate!! muuak 😘
18/5/20 21:33 - Joe: I’ll send you videos of boring California hahah. I’ll be back soon to send more though....or you can just come here 😂
18/5/20 21:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:34 - Joe: I’ll make sure you have a nice collection of photos and videos of Hawaii before I leave
18/5/20 21:34 - Joe: Ok. Back on the road. I won’t be long 😘
18/5/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 21:41 - Lorena: Dios ese puto color turquesa 🤯😍
18/5/20 21:41 - Lorena: Me gustan estas cosas en la playa jaja
18/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: No creo que sea aburrida jaja decidiré según las fotos cual me guste más y si el puto Trump me deja entrar jajajaj
18/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: Disfrutaaa 🛹🌴
18/5/20 22:30 - Joe: Aaaah I just spent 25 minutes trying one trick hahaha.
18/5/20 22:30 - Joe: Didn’t get it 😞
18/5/20 22:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 23:23 - Joe: Just letting you know I’m back from skating
18/5/20 23:37 - Lorena: Ohhh hay "toma falsa", que intentabas hacer?
18/5/20 23:38 - Lorena: Ayyy que linda!! Es grande!
18/5/20 23:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 23:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/5/20 23:42 - Joe: 😂
18/5/20 23:47 - Lorena: Jajaja miré a la izquierda pensando, desapareció, se lastimó? Jajaja
18/5/20 23:54 - Joe: Haha i was fine. Just frustrated cause I was close to landing it. And I thought it would be easy when I started trying it.
18/5/20 23:57 - Lorena: jaja hoy no es un buen día para Joe, ni español ni skate
19/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 0:01 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I guess I’m a little off today
19/5/20 0:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 0:02 - Lorena: jjjjj
19/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: voy a empezar a apuntar notas también jaja
19/5/20 0:07 - Lorena: I changed the SHEETS today, I had soiled them with avocado, one of the insignificant things, but what I like the most is the freshly cleaned sheets, the smell of softener
19/5/20 0:12 - Joe: Hahaha sheets 😂 

I feel it. Clean sheets are so fuckin great. Extra level of comfort when they’re freshly washed
19/5/20 0:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 0:14 - Joe: Nelly and Carlos(we call him Boom Boom hahaha)
19/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: jaja kion?
19/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: eso se dice en Perú, en España es Jengibre
19/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: jaja que divina, te manda todas las palabras
19/5/20 0:26 - Joe: Yeah she is really trying to make me learn. I knew she would be excited about it when she found out haha
19/5/20 0:28 - Joe: I’m trying to get this gif thing working today so I don’t feel like I failed at everything. 

It might end up being another thing to add to today’s list of failures though hahaha. Fuck. What a day
19/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: Es genial, si hubieses aprendido español antes, no tendrías estos momentos de aprender con Nelly
19/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: gif?
19/5/20 0:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: gif o caras como emociones, como skype.,más básicos
19/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: Bueno, te dejo probando con tu juego jjj
19/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: me voy a dormirr, que la tarde vaya mejorando! un beso!! 😘
19/5/20 0:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 2:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 5:14 - Lorena: 👏👏👏👏
19/5/20 5:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 5:20 - Joe: Hahaha oooh I wish. I’m up earlier than you most times so I’d rub your head all morning if you want 😂 

Back to bed haha I’ll talk to you soon 😊
19/5/20 5:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 5:32 - Lorena: Sería perfecto
19/5/20 5:33 - Lorena: Además tuve una pesadilla por eso me desperté 😭
19/5/20 5:34 - Joe: Aw that sucks haha. I hope you have better dreams if you can get back to sleep 💤 🛏
19/5/20 7:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 7:58 - Lorena: Jaja m había quedado dormida
19/5/20 8:01 - Joe: Haha you don’t know how much I would love to rub your head in the mornings 😂
19/5/20 8:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 8:38 - Lorena: Yaaa 😴
19/5/20 8:39 - Lorena: Ahora sí, jajaja me había vuelto a dormir
19/5/20 8:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 8:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 8:47 - Joe: I’m going to right this down to use later haha
19/5/20 8:47 - Lorena: muy bieeen!!!!
19/5/20 8:51 - Lorena: cual es la diferencia del primer video con el segundo? el rectángulo ahora es más grande no? y antes salia el link al elefgir el gif, ahora sale la imagen en pequeña
19/5/20 8:53 - Lorena: pregunta: si te escribo por chat, y cierro, el mensaje se borra o podés verlo?
19/5/20 8:54 - Joe: I can still see it until I close the game on my end.
19/5/20 8:56 - Joe: Oh yeah making the little preview instead of the text showing up in the box took forever haha. Had to make the preview appear, then add a button to cancel if you don’t want to use the gif, and make sure if you choose another gif it replaces the current one and doesn’t add another preview
19/5/20 8:56 - Joe: It was a little complicated and frustrating but I got it. 1/3 today 😂
19/5/20 8:57 - Joe: Oh but if someone else joins they can’t see any chat that was written before they entered. Or if you rejoin, you won’t be able to see it. But it never gets deleted for anyone that stays in the game
19/5/20 8:59 - Lorena: I went into our room, put a gif and played a game, you see that later then?
19/5/20 9:02 - Lorena: cuando la gente normal, que no se dedica a esto, navega por un web, o juego, no es consciente del trabajo que hay detrás, jaja es todo desde cero.. bueno yo creo que aprendiste algo bueno hoy no?? para futuros trabajos te servirá
19/5/20 9:02 - Joe: No cause I’m not in the room now. So if I join i see a blank chat. And actually the room will be deleted when the last player is gone
19/5/20 9:03 - Lorena: ahhhh, eso quería saber!!
19/5/20 9:04 - Joe: Yeah it’ll be another thing to tack onto the resumé so that’s good. Plus it’ll make playing way more fun 😂
19/5/20 9:04 - Joe: I sent a video to my friends, they were stoked on the new feature
19/5/20 9:05 - Joe: But yeah it’s kind of crazy to think about how everything we use on the internet had to be made in a similar way. Just a bunch of code
19/5/20 9:06 - Lorena: jjjj hombrecito!!! pues entra en la habitación y vamos a probar esos nuevos gifs!!!
19/5/20 9:07 - Joe: Haha ok
19/5/20 9:08 - Lorena: no??
19/5/20 9:08 - Joe: Let’s play
19/5/20 9:08 - Lorena: despues del esfuerzoo, ahora a probarlo!
19/5/20 9:08 - Joe: I want to try it
19/5/20 9:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:17 - Joe: Damn what happened? It’s stuck? Shit
19/5/20 9:17 - Joe: Hmmmmmm
19/5/20 9:18 - Lorena: no hay "X" para cerrar la ventana
19/5/20 9:18 - Joe: You just click anywhere that is not the box
19/5/20 9:18 - Lorena: no me deja cerrarla, tampoco con la letra escape, ni pinchando fuera
19/5/20 9:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:19 - Lorena: ah ahora si!
19/5/20 9:19 - Joe: Oh sweet
19/5/20 9:19 - Joe: I wonder why it didn’t work. I hope it doesn’t do that a lot to people haha
19/5/20 9:20 - Lorena: jaja tranquilo, respiraaaaa
19/5/20 9:20 - Lorena: no podés poner una x? o la opción que la persona de a la letra esc?
19/5/20 9:21 - Joe: I could probably do both. Alright...added to the list
19/5/20 9:22 - Lorena: cuántos gif hay en esa página
19/5/20 9:22 - Lorena: mi madre se vuelve loca, le encantan cada vez que se lo pongo
19/5/20 9:22 - Lorena: y me pregunta, como lo conseguisteeee??? a mi no me salen tan buenos
19/5/20 9:23 - Lorena: y ella, los busca en la conversación y los vuelve a reenviar a mi hermano, a mi... jajajaja
19/5/20 9:25 - Joe: I don’t know hahah. You have access to GIPHY’s whole library of gifs. Probably the same that this app uses.
19/5/20 9:25 - Joe: Facebook just bought GIPHY this week and the own WhatsApp
19/5/20 9:26 - Joe: Hahaha i wonder what kind of gifs your mom likes? 😂 

I always think about sending my mom a meme or gif but I rarely do
19/5/20 9:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:30 - Joe: Hahaha that’s good. I need to teach my mom to use them. I’m interested to see what she would send.
19/5/20 9:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:33 - Lorena: jajajaja si, mi madre esta mejorando con el envio de gifs, aunque ella opta por reenviar los que yo mando a todo el mundo
19/5/20 9:38 - Joe: Hahahah “mister bean” “en google?” Hahaha
19/5/20 9:40 - Joe: You need to teach her how to find the hidden gems 💎 I’ve been getting good with the gifs from talking to you 😂
19/5/20 9:40 - Lorena: Ella pregunta cómo tengo gif graciosos los suyos dice que son básicos y le expliqué que tiene que poner en el buscador de gif una palabra
19/5/20 9:40 - Lorena: Y me dice dónde, en Google?
19/5/20 9:40 - Lorena: 🙈🙈🙈
19/5/20 9:41 - Lorena: Si, siempre elegiste muy buenos gif jajaja eso fue un punto a tu favor
19/5/20 9:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:49 - Joe: Hahaha that’s good to know. I got points for the good gifs 😂 

I’m becoming fluent in the language of gif as a backup in case I can’t learn Spanish. All communication will be with gifs only haha
19/5/20 9:51 - Lorena: Jajaja
19/5/20 9:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 9:55 - Joe: Haha hair and pants are looking wild. I love it 😂
19/5/20 10:19 - Lorena: Jajaj
19/5/20 10:20 - Lorena: Eyy me estaba preparando el desayuno
19/5/20 10:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 10:20 - Joe: The skateboarding from earlier today wiped me out. I should’ve taken a nap.
19/5/20 10:20 - Joe: Don’t be surprised if i pass out out of nowhere today haha
19/5/20 10:20 - Joe: Mmmm
19/5/20 10:21 - Lorena: Jajaja si es mi pijama largo, y el pelo 🥴 un moño
19/5/20 10:23 - Joe: Haha I like the look very much. Nice and comfortable
19/5/20 10:24 - Lorena: Jajaj bueno no te preocupes, descansa. Yo estoy desayunando y empiezo el curso en un rato!!! 🤓
19/5/20 10:24 - Lorena: Gracias 🥰
19/5/20 10:27 - Joe: Haha alright. Well I guess I’ll lay down. I’ll probably fall asleep instantly, I can feel it coming haha.
19/5/20 10:28 - Joe: Have a good day, I hope the course goes well for you! 

I’ll talk you you later 😘
19/5/20 10:29 - Lorena: Si te cuesta dormir, mira este vídeo
19/5/20 10:31 - Lorena: https://youtu.be/knj9Atxscrc
19/5/20 10:31 - Lorena: Autodidacta
19/5/20 10:32 - Joe: Haha cool I’ll put it on
19/5/20 10:32 - Joe: That’s me. But I’m not like super smart or anything hahah. Sounds cool. I’ll watch it
19/5/20 10:33 - Lorena: Jaja sí ahí es una ruina en Estados Unidos la educación
19/5/20 10:34 - Lorena: Acá no es tanto, ni mucho menos...
19/5/20 10:34 - Lorena: Pero me gusta la manera de aprender, más práctica y efectiva que estar 4 años encerrado
19/5/20 10:37 - Joe: Same! I LOVE learning but college still was not the right choice for me and I’m glad i didn’t go. I would probably be in so much debt haha. Instead I have a nice little savings 👍
19/5/20 10:38 - Joe: So far it’s working out. I know a lot of people that went to college but aren’t using their degrees in the end. 

I’m happy with my decisions at the moment. Glad you’re on the same hype with taking your own path to learning
19/5/20 10:41 - Lorena: Jaja te va a gustar entonces el video del chico
19/5/20 10:42 - Lorena: Yo estudié en una escuela de arte, es pública, hice una prueba de acceso y la nota me dio para tener una plaza. Para interiores si necesito "titulación"
19/5/20 10:43 - Lorena: Pero estoy en el mismo "hype" jaja no hace falta universidad no super títulos para aprender una cosa
19/5/20 10:44 - Joe: It only cost this dude $5,000 to stay in Argentina for 4 months. I should do that hahah
19/5/20 10:44 - Lorena: Por ej. El título del curso del 3D no me valdría en absoluto, lo que vale son los resultados
19/5/20 10:45 - Lorena: Como vos.. imagina un chico que paga por desarrollador web y luego no sabe cómo resolver los problemas de los códigos etc jaja, vos serías elegido por qué lo que importa es lo demostrable no el título
19/5/20 10:46 - Lorena: bueno depende de la vida que te guste llevar .. pero se puede ajustar mucho más ese presupuesto
19/5/20 10:48 - Joe: Yeah web development has many self taught people. It’s all about what you can do, so portfolios and projects are important. 

Probably similar with the 3D modeling.
19/5/20 10:49 - Joe: Hmm well I’m pretty flexible on lifestyle haha I don’t need much. 

But I’ve been saving for a while so I’m ready to go on a trip like that 😂
19/5/20 10:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 10:50 - Lorena: Exacto! A mí se me ocurrió la idea de compartir el curso con Sandra. Jaja cómo es online, lo pagamos a medias, el título nos importa una mierda. Solo ver los vídeos juntas, etc
19/5/20 10:50 - Lorena: Muy bieeeeen!
19/5/20 10:51 - Lorena: Tendrás que pensar el destino! Jjjj
19/5/20 10:51 - Lorena: Además si nunca viajaste fuera de USA vas a alucinar
19/5/20 10:53 - Joe: Hahah nice. That’s a good way to do it 😂
19/5/20 10:53 - Joe: I need to think about the destination? Cause I’m pretty sure it would just be wherever you are Hahahaha
19/5/20 10:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 10:56 - Lorena: Jajajajaja pero nos veremos!!!
19/5/20 10:59 - Lorena: Me pongo con el curso!!!
19/5/20 10:59 - Joe: Hahah sure.
19/5/20 10:59 - Lorena: Hablamos luego, que duermas bien, un besooo!
19/5/20 10:59 - Joe: Ok have a good day! 😘
19/5/20 11:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 20:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 20:16 - Lorena: Oinnns

19/5/20 20:31 - Lorena: Buenos días bombón!!
19/5/20 20:32 - Lorena: Disfruta de ese café, yo mate. Luego me contás cómo te fue la clase. 😘
19/5/20 20:34 - Joe: Hahaha 😊
19/5/20 20:34 - Joe: Alright I’ll talk to you after the class 😘
19/5/20 21:32 - Joe: Ok all done. Today the main thing I learned it the importance of the apostrophe haha.
19/5/20 21:33 - Joe: Nelly told me about her friend that would get mad because people would write “Feliz ano nuevo” on Facebook without using the “ñ” hahaha
19/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Eyyyy
19/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Fui a tomar unos mates
19/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Con mi amiga Luchi que es la que está más cerca jaja
19/5/20 22:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: Jaja muy bien, audio de esa clase de español
19/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: Jajaja si la ñ! No la pone mucha gente al aprender español
19/5/20 22:43 - Joe: No pasa nada haha
19/5/20 22:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 22:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/5/20 22:48 - Joe: Sorry I y’all too quiet and the street is so loud haha
19/5/20 22:52 - Lorena: Jajaja te creo, no ví ninguna foto en tu perfil, bueno hay una que tenés que me gusta mucho pero la tenés medio oculta jaja
19/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: Pareces un hawaiano más jjj te falta el collar d flores
19/5/20 22:53 - Joe: Yeah I don’t post any selfies haha. This one won’t be posted either most likely haha. Just one for you
19/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: 🥰
19/5/20 22:54 - Joe: Hahaha there is a name for the dudes like me with the gold chain and stuff out here. I forgot what it was though
19/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Jajaja en España sería como gitano
19/5/20 22:59 - Joe: I’ll tell you what it is when I remember or I’ll ask my sister. I got this chain from Nelly probably 15 years ago. It has a pendant that is in the shape of Peru and says “PERU” across it. 

The part that holds it to the chain broke so I have to get that fixed
19/5/20 23:00 - Lorena: Si me imaginé que sería algo d tu familia
19/5/20 23:00 - Lorena: Los abuelos antes llevaban mucho oro, y en sudamérica es normal
19/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Me gusta como te queda y el significado
19/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: Ay el audio no lo escucho bien, hay mucho ruido alrededor jaja
19/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: Solo entendí feliz año nuevo
19/5/20 23:10 - Joe: Haha yeah she got it on a trip to Peru too so I really like it.
19/5/20 23:10 - Joe: I’m going to take a shower really quick and I’ll redo the audio 🚿
19/5/20 23:14 - Lorena: Osea que chiquitito lo llevabas también el colgante? Quiero ver alguna foto tuya de chiquito, como como 5-8 años
19/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: Disfruta de esa ducha jjj
19/5/20 23:43 - Joe: Haha all the pictures of me at that age are mostly me in sports uniforms. Like baseball and soccer. The baseball ones are funny cause I wore a helmet that made my head look huge 😂
19/5/20 23:45 - Joe: Este mensaje fue eliminado
19/5/20 23:45 - Joe: Dammit I always start talking before it records

20/5/20 0:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/5/20 0:04 - Lorena: Justo en un callejón, y luego por la noche pasa el camión de basura y los contenedores quedan vacíos

20/5/20 0:11 - Joe: Haha I appreciate you sending the picture. I think it’s really interesting that you came across that. Life is so strange sometimes. Beautifully strange.
20/5/20 0:15 - Joe: Oh and I’ll send pictures of mini Joe when I get back to California but you’ll have to send me mini Lore pictures in return 😂
20/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

20/5/20 0:38 - Joe: You’ll be disappointed with my pictures when I send them. I don’t think I have a lot of good ones. I’ll have to ask my parents to see if they’re hiding any.
20/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: 🤔
20/5/20 0:40 - Joe: So, right now I’m using these things to try and hear words better....music you sent me, la casa de Papel, and I’m watching a bunch of “Casi Creativo” videos hahaha

If you have anything else I can listen to, send it

20/5/20 22:28 - Joe: It’s alright though. I’m used to feeling dumb at the beginning when I start learning something. Happens every time I get a new hobby or decide to learn anything really
20/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Haha do I talk fast?

21/5/20 0:17 - Joe: Alriiiight. I’ll actually start looking into the logistics of making it happen. Of course it will be after the pandemic and when I have my passport haha but it shouldn’t be too difficult to make it happen
21/5/20 0:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
21/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Elegís los gifs perfectos
21/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Bueno todos los que tengan animales siempre me harán gracia
21/5/20 0:19 - Joe: The animal gifs are great. Especially when they’re doing weird stuff haha
21/5/20 0:19 - Lorena: Nos hacemos una casa a manos dos en Hawaii y adoptamos un perro? Jajajaja ( tomé dos cervezas y 🤪)
21/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: *A mano los dos
21/5/20 0:20 - Joe: Please don’t just be the beer talking because you don’t understand how perfect that sounds to me
21/5/20 0:21 - Joe: My dream life haha
21/5/20 0:21 - Lorena: Jajajaj
21/5/20 0:21 - Lorena: Cuantos y que animales?
21/5/20 0:22 - Lorena: Yo puedo aceptar a algún gato como oni, y algunas gallinas!!
21/5/20 0:23 - Joe: Haha definitely chickens, maybe a goat, and dogs. From there it depends how much space I have. I also want to grow a lot of food
21/5/20 0:25 - Joe: But how many of everything depends on the space. I still need to save more before I can start on that but I’ve been working towards a life like that
21/5/20 0:25 - Lorena: Jajaj si una cabra!!!
21/5/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 0:26 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
21/5/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 0:26 - Joe: I want one haha
21/5/20 0:26 - Lorena: Jajajajaja geniales
21/5/20 0:27 - Lorena: Queremos la misma vida, vivamos juntos jajajaja
21/5/20 0:27 - Lorena: Podemos hacer una rampa en el jardín para que puedas patinar
21/5/20 0:28 - Joe: Duuuuude stop hahaha I already want you 😂
21/5/20 0:28 - Joe: Aaaah I’m just kidding though. I just think it’s so strange how we want such similar lives
21/5/20 0:29 - Joe: And somehow you decided to talk to me from across the world even though I’m pretty difficult to talk to in the beginning
21/5/20 0:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 0:30 - Joe: Hahaha
21/5/20 0:31 - Joe: I just don’t know what to think hahah. Is life really full of such serendipity?
21/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: Jajaja si, te elegí sin saberlo
21/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: Podría ser como con otro que hablé dos palabras por ser go diferent y luego dejamos de hablar
21/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: Pero con vos no jajaja así que si, es raro pinocho y mucha casualidad
21/5/20 0:34 - Joe: Hmmm....
21/5/20 0:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 0:36 - Joe: Haha I really don’t know what to think about it all sometimes 😂 

I guess I’ll just say it’s all a coincidence hahaha. Fuck. So weird
21/5/20 0:36 - Joe: Anyway, what kind of animals and how many would you want?
21/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: No sé, pero querer ver a una persona que está en otro puto lado del mundo, me parece una locura y me encanta que pase, todo es una experiencia nueva y me gustan las cosas diferentes
21/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: Me aburre tremendamente tener que estar como el resto, trabajar en una oficina, 8 horas, ir al cine, cenar, dormir, y trabajar.
21/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Aunque ahora lo tengo que hacer porque al final vivo en una ciudad pero no es mi plan de vida
21/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Stop being perfect hahaha

This is definitely me.
21/5/20 0:41 - Joe: Yeah I understand. You have to do what you have to do to get by. But you have the right goal haha
21/5/20 0:41 - Lorena: Jajaja vamos a la par pinocho
21/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Mmmm me gustaría un buen jardín.. para tener... Unos 5 perros, 1 o 2 gatos( no suelen gustarme mucho los gatos, pero si están en compañía de otros animales me hacen gracia), algún gallo que me dé los buenos días y algunas gallinas huevos jaja, que estén sueltas con los perros por el césped
21/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Mmm creo que una cabrita también me encantaría
21/5/20 0:45 - Lorena: Y ya luego hamacas paraguayas para poder estar mucho tiempo fuera descansando jaja
21/5/20 0:45 - Lorena: Un huerto también, tomates, pepinos, alguna plantita de "maria"
21/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: Jajaja basta 💭
21/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: Y muuuuuchas plantas, en todos lados, fuera y dentro de la casa, incluso en el baño  jaja
21/5/20 0:50 - Joe: Those are some wonderful dreams. I know I’m just some random dude on the internet or whatever but I’d be really happy to work together to make that happen. Team work makes the dream work haha
21/5/20 0:52 - Joe: But like you said...enough 💭 hahaha it just sounds so nice though
21/5/20 0:52 - Lorena: Jajaja ay ay ay.. aleatorio no.
21/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Y vos qué animales tendrías y que casa?
21/5/20 0:53 - Joe: I think it’s fair to admit I’m pretty random haha
21/5/20 0:54 - Joe: I mean my plan is basically what you described. Maybe I didn’t think it would be so many dogs and cats but “the more the merrier” as they say haha
21/5/20 0:55 - Joe: Small house. Lots of land. Animals and nature
21/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: Que más?
21/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: Jaja siempre pensé muchos, pero ahora mientras escribía puse número para imaginarlo de verdad al principio jaja
21/5/20 0:59 - Joe: Haha wellll I really want my small house to be cute and inconspicuous. Look like a very old style, made by hand, but on the inside it will be like a smart house hahah. And I want to grow mangoes 🥭 and avocados 🥑 possibly coffee if the location is right for it. I also want a garden full of variety. Basically anything I can make grow well in the climate my house ends up in. There is a big difference between being up higher and being near the shore in terms of climate.
21/5/20 0:59 - Joe: Most likely off grid with solar
21/5/20 0:59 - Joe: And a catchment for the water
21/5/20 1:01 - Joe: I’m trying to think of anything else 🤔
21/5/20 1:02 - Joe: I don’t know. Just a simple lifestyle I suppose. Not much too it but it will still take a lot of work.
21/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Mmm puedo vivir con vos?
21/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jajaja
21/5/20 1:05 - Joe: That would complete the dream for me so yes you can haha
21/5/20 1:05 - Lorena: No había pensado en los mangos y aguacates! Son de mis preferidos!
21/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: Todos los alimentos que se puedan!
21/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: En un clima tropical los frutos serían deliciosos
21/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Jaja sí el jardín es grande vos podés elegir algo para poder patinar y yo una mini piscina para poder meterme con los perros al agua jaja
21/5/20 1:09 - Joe: I better start saving more money 😂
21/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: Jajajaja
21/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: Bueno al final creo que es re importante tener sueños y objetivos, saber lo que no queremos y lo que podría ser una vida como nos gusta. Lo bueno es que es sin lujos como una mansión o un piso en centro de una ciudad
21/5/20 1:11 - Joe: Hahaha you don’t understand. I’ve been imagining this for a long time. I actually have been putting money away to make this dream real for me. I’m not going to take no for an answer from the world on this one.
21/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: 👏👏👏👏
21/5/20 1:14 - Lorena: Lo conseguirás, se nota como hablas de ello al imaginarlo, serás un hippie en tu casa con todo tipo de frutas y verduras y animales de todo tipo 💙
21/5/20 1:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:19 - Joe: Thank you. You forgot the part about you being there with me haha
21/5/20 1:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

21/5/20 1:37 - Joe: Hahaha
21/5/20 1:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:39 - Joe: You don’t want to have a gif battle ahahaha
21/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: Jajaja
21/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

21/5/20 1:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

21/5/20 1:48 - Joe: HahahahHah
21/5/20 1:48 - Joe: 😂
21/5/20 1:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Buena respuesta!!! Jajaja
21/5/20 1:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Gifs are all we need to communicate 😂
21/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Sabes que sería divertido?
21/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Hmm?
21/5/20 1:51 - Lorena: Jajaja si totalmente!!
21/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Hahaha
21/5/20 1:51 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 1:51 - Lorena: 👆
21/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Oh boy haha
21/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: Jajaja qué crees?
21/5/20 1:52 - Joe: For sure 😂
21/5/20 1:53 - Joe: I think you’re making me want to see you even more haha. Uuuugh this distance 😔
21/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: Jajajaj mmm vos te tocaste algún día pensando en mí?
21/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: ( no te pongas nervioso jajaja)
21/5/20 1:56 - Joe: Oh boy hahah
21/5/20 1:56 - Joe: Aaaah
21/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: Jajaja o no sos una persona sexual?
21/5/20 1:56 - Joe: I have
21/5/20 1:57 - Joe: I am sort of haha. The same way I’m not talkative if you don’t know me, I’m not super sexual unless I really feel for you.
21/5/20 1:59 - Joe: Also I’ve never had to express my sexuality from a distance because I’ve never been in this situation
21/5/20 1:59 - Joe: No one has ever made me really have feelings for them from across the world haha
21/5/20 2:01 - Lorena: Mmm
21/5/20 2:02 - Lorena: Jaja creo que lo entiendo
21/5/20 2:04 - Joe: Hahah sorry if I’m disappointing you here. It’s just who I am though. If I was near you, you would be getting 100% of my affection. You’ve gotten a lot further than most 😂
21/5/20 2:05 - Lorena: Jaja no pasa nadaaa era solo una pregunta!!!
21/5/20 2:05 - Lorena: Tenía curiosidad
21/5/20 2:06 - Joe: Ok. What about you? I’m assuming you’re a little more of a sexual personality than me haha
21/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Mostly because I’m shy as fuck not because I think something about what you do hahaha

I’m just saying I feel like you have an easier time expressing it than me?
21/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: Mm si soy espontánea e impulsiva, si me siento cómoda no tengo problema en decir cualquier cosa
21/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: Pero después de estar hablando con vos tantosss días, te lo solté
21/5/20 2:11 - Lorena: Soy sexual si, pasional mejor dicho.. no sé, tampoco me había tocado tener que expresar esto a un desconocido jaja
21/5/20 2:11 - Joe: Haha sorry about that. For you and any boys in Madrid that have their eye on you 😂
21/5/20 2:12 - Lorena: Jaja qué sentís?
21/5/20 2:12 - Joe: I know what you mean. By this point I would usually have to just express through action haha
21/5/20 2:14 - Lorena: Ya.. pero acción a 12.000km...
21/5/20 2:15 - Lorena: Pero me gustaría poder hablar d ello como algo normal jaja, no sé
21/5/20 2:15 - Joe: Hmm yeah that’s unfortunate haha fuck
21/5/20 2:17 - Joe: Yeah that’s true. I’ll try to be as open, honest, and comfortable about it with you as I can be
21/5/20 2:19 - Lorena: Eso sí, si sos asexual necesito saberlo jajaja
21/5/20 2:20 - Joe: Not at all. I love sex hahahah but only with a certain person or I can’t even enjoy anything
21/5/20 2:21 - Joe: Definitely not asexual. Just.....really picky haha
21/5/20 2:23 - Lorena: 🤷 obviamente no? Jaja quien se va a acostar con alguien que no quiera
21/5/20 2:24 - Lorena: Jajaj si fuese de esta manera, no te diría que saques el pasaporte y vengas jajaja
21/5/20 2:27 - Joe: You’d be surprised. I mean, a lot of people can sleep with people they’re only physically attracted to, even if they don’t have much of a connection and enjoy it a lot. I can’t do that.
21/5/20 2:27 - Joe: Don’t worry. I would be all over you hahaha
21/5/20 2:29 - Lorena: 😯 que bonito!
21/5/20 2:30 - Lorena: Ya no sé que pensar jajaja pero espero que sí
21/5/20 2:33 - Joe: I really like you. I don’t know how to make that clear without seeming weird hahaha 

I like talking to you and hearing what you think about things. I enjoy your opinions on the world and I like the things you put value on in your life. Those are the things that attract me to people.
21/5/20 2:34 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVrAAJIyQ8/?igshid=1fo345zwifgju
21/5/20 2:34 - Joe: I would definitely be all over you. And I wouldn’t let you go. 

Seriously reconsider getting into anything with me unless you want to end up married 😂
21/5/20 2:36 - Lorena: Jaja mierda cuando consigo que hables de tus sentimientos se me ocurre pasar un vídeo, jajaja de una ola asesina
21/5/20 2:37 - Joe: Haha it was a good video
21/5/20 2:38 - Lorena: Que lindo lo que decís, muchas gracias! Siento lo mismo por vos ☺️
21/5/20 2:39 - Lorena: Y esta la combinación perfecta jajaja aunque siempre critiqué los casamientos
21/5/20 2:41 - Joe: That’s fine. Don’t need to get married then, but you’ll end up with me for a long ass time haha
21/5/20 2:43 - Lorena: Jajajaja al final me harás creerlo
21/5/20 2:43 - Joe: Ok I’m sorry to keep you up with my crazy dreams of being together hahaha 

maybe you should get some sleep so you’re ready for class tomorrow
21/5/20 2:44 - Joe: Good cause I’m going to make it happen so I don’t want you to be too surprised
21/5/20 2:45 - Lorena: Jajaj todo bien, yo empecé... Poco a poco jajaja vos solo te dejaste llevar pero yo fui la culpable de la conversación en el momento que te dije que tenía ganas de verte, etc jajaja
21/5/20 2:46 - Joe: Haha you make me excited when you talk about seeing me, sorry 😂
21/5/20 2:46 - Joe: Ok well you get some sleep then
21/5/20 2:47 - Joe: I’ll talk to you tomorrow I’m sure haha
21/5/20 2:49 - Lorena: Jajaja, te lo diré alguna vez más 🤗
21/5/20 2:50 - Lorena: Jaja sí me voy a dormir, creo que mañana puedo enseñarte algo nuevo del cursooo!!!
21/5/20 2:51 - Joe: Ok sounds good. Looking forward to seeing it!
21/5/20 2:51 - Lorena: Hoy Sandra empezó a trabajar y yo estuve toda la mañana y unas horas por la tarde, haciendo ejercicio sola

21/5/20 19:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 19:29 - Joe: Hahaha
21/5/20 19:30 - Joe: I should probably take it semi-seriously. If I get it working really well I can run ads and try to make a few bucks from a dumb game i wanted to make for my friends in quarantine haha.
21/5/20 19:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 19:55 - Lorena: Y dale..  con Dumb game.. al final se va a quedar ese nombre! Jaja
21/5/20 19:56 - Lorena: Podrías sii!! Yo te apoyo jaja
21/5/20 19:57 - Lorena: Gracias! Vos también, aprende cosas con Nelly así me contás luego que tal ☺️😘
21/5/20 21:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/5/20 21:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

22/5/20 9:01 - Joe: Mmm that sucks you have a headache. I hope you feel better.
22/5/20 9:02 - Joe: Haha my notes are kind of silly but we just talk a lot and i occasionally write stuff down. It’s not super serious
22/5/20 9:03 - Joe: But what do you want to hear?

Oh and, buenos días 🌞
22/5/20 9:03 - Lorena: Si es que hay muchos cambios de temperatura, y tengo alergia por el polen este año
22/5/20 9:04 - Lorena: Y no paro de estornudar
22/5/20 9:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:08 - Joe: I don’t have allergies so i can’t relate haha but that sounds terrible.
22/5/20 9:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:10 - Lorena: Jajajaj
22/5/20 9:10 - Lorena: Tan terrible no

22/5/20 9:11 - Lorena: Así que cualquier cosa que me cuentes de tu clase me parecerá bien
22/5/20 9:11 - Lorena: Por audio o por video
22/5/20 9:19 - Joe: Hahaha maybe I’ll send a video tomorrow. I’m a fucking mess 😂 alright let me look at these notes
22/5/20 9:21 - Lorena: Jajaj bueno me conformo con audio
22/5/20 9:22 - Lorena: A ver que aprendiste!!!! Jjjj
22/5/20 9:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:24 - Joe: Oh and I found out discovery channel apparently has really good spanish speaking and subtitles haha so I need to watch discovery channel
22/5/20 9:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:33 - Lorena: Vine a comprar café al súper que no tenía
22/5/20 9:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

22/5/20 9:36 - Lorena: Te entendí todo muy bienn 👏
22/5/20 9:40 - Lorena: Perfecta
22/5/20 9:41 - Joe: Oh noooo! Haha that sucks. Too much pollen, not enough coffee. What’s next?
22/5/20 9:41 - Lorena: 😂
22/5/20 9:42 - Joe: Haha my American accent. I don’t know if that’s good or not but thanks for saying my voice is sweet 😂 cause I hate it
22/5/20 9:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:48 - Lorena: Jajaja si, me gusta
22/5/20 9:49 - Lorena: Si es bueno,a mí me hace gracia. Además te entiendo, y eso me gusta, porque significa que podremos comunicarnos cuando nos veamos
22/5/20 9:55 - Joe: You can understand my spanish or my English? Haha my spanish is so trash. 

But I was thinking I need a book. Cause I need to learn all the rules of the language.
22/5/20 9:57 - Joe: Like learning all the common rules for tenses and conjugations then work on the special cases that are slightly different. I don’t know. I just feel like I’m being inefficient with how I’m going about this and I could be learning faster
22/5/20 9:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 9:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

22/5/20 10:03 - Lorena: O alguna página/ libro que este organizada
22/5/20 10:03 - Lorena: Mirar los tiempos verbales y leer como escribo o cómo podrías decirlo
22/5/20 10:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:08 - Joe: Haha the channel is called “discovery channel”. I haven’t watched any programs yet cause I don’t think I have it here. I’ll have to find it online
22/5/20 10:09 - Lorena: Jajajajaja

22/5/20 10:11 - Lorena: Joe cuándo venís a España?
22/5/20 10:11 - Lorena: O acá se diría cuándo vienes a España?
22/5/20 10:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:12 - Joe: Too many ways to say things hahaha shit
22/5/20 10:12 - Lorena: Jajaja pero te entiende todo el mundo, son pequeñas diferencias
22/5/20 10:13 - Lorena: Que acento querés hablar?
22/5/20 10:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:14 - Lorena: Muy bien dicho!
22/5/20 10:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:16 - Lorena: Jajajaja
22/5/20 10:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:17 - Joe: Hahahahaha fuuuuuuck
22/5/20 10:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:18 - Lorena: Jajajaja oni
22/5/20 10:18 - Joe: Haha he is being loud
22/5/20 10:18 - Lorena: Esta bien dicho!!!
22/5/20 10:18 - Lorena: Oki parece tu bebé jajaja no te deja hablar español
22/5/20 10:19 - Joe: It’s alright. My frustration will help me improve. Better to be frustrated with being mediocre than to be satisfied I guess 😂
22/5/20 10:20 - Joe: No he just wanted to talk back to me haha. He wants to learn too.
22/5/20 10:20 - Joe: He’s hella talkative though. Always making noise
22/5/20 10:20 - Lorena: Jajaj pero te entiendo cuando lo pronuncias, no te frustres por eso
22/5/20 10:20 - Lorena: Jajajaa
22/5/20 10:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:24 - Joe: Haha maybe I just can’t imagine someone’s pronunciation being so bad that you couldn’t understand. I don’t know. 

It’s alright. I get frustrated with everything I try to learn. It’s a good sign. It shows me that I’m at the edge of my comfort zone and that’s where you learn the most
22/5/20 10:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:25 - Lorena: Exacto, estás aprendiendo! En cuanto a la pronunciación, hay gente que no se entiende nada, como el chino del vídeo jajajaja
22/5/20 10:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:27 - Lorena: "Cuándo te despertás por la mañana y no sabés quién sos"
22/5/20 10:29 - Joe: Hahah I forgot about that. Ronronear 😂
22/5/20 10:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:31 - Joe: Hahahahahah that’s actually kind of hard 😂
22/5/20 10:32 - Lorena: Jajajaja
22/5/20 10:32 - Lorena: Al principio fuiste como el chino
22/5/20 10:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:33 - Joe: Hahaha I like the way you say it here
22/5/20 10:33 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
22/5/20 10:33 - Joe: When you make fun of me hahah
22/5/20 10:33 - Lorena: Como el chino
22/5/20 10:33 - Joe: Hahaha shit
22/5/20 10:34 - Joe: Just at the beginning. Takes a few tries for me to get it.
22/5/20 10:35 - Joe: I’m going to stop using the word “purr” in English and only use ronronear until I got it down hahah
22/5/20 10:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 10:39 - Lorena: Podés hacer caso a Nelly y poner un cartel a Oni en el cuello que ponga ronronear
22/5/20 10:40 - Lorena: Jajajaja no
22/5/20 10:41 - Joe: It’s ok I don’t think I’ll end up needed that word too much I hope hahah

22/5/20 11:08 - Joe: Mmmmm
22/5/20 11:09 - Lorena: Puedo pero no debo
22/5/20 11:10 - Lorena: Mañana y pasado ya no hago
22/5/20 11:10 - Lorena: Es que el ejercicio de hoy es un asco... Hay que hacer un entorno urbano, farolas, papeleras, calles, barandillas
22/5/20 11:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:11 - Joe: Haha make something for me to skate 😂

22/5/20 11:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:17 - Joe: Haha same. Ever since I saw that video. Sorry for giving you the same thoughts hahaha
22/5/20 11:18 - Joe: Ok I’ll talk to you later, I’m going to get some sleep. I hope class goes well for you
22/5/20 11:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:23 - Lorena: ☺️☺️☺️
22/5/20 11:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:35 - Lorena: porfiiiiiiii, esta lleno y me da problemas con el programa, vos sabés algo de esto?
22/5/20 11:36 - Joe: Haha yeah you need to delete things you don’t need or transfer them to cloud storage or an external hard drive.
22/5/20 11:36 - Joe: You can put things on Dropbox or something similar and delete them from your computer or buy something like a Samsung SSD and transfer things to that
22/5/20 11:37 - Lorena: Es que solo tengo programas ahi, no tengo fotos ni nada
22/5/20 11:37 - Lorena: "supuestamente" no puedo eliminar, porque no sé que son, la carpeta de windows con codigos y mierdas, pesa mucho
22/5/20 11:37 - Joe: Hmmmm
22/5/20 11:38 - Lorena: si tengo dos discos ahi, el D y el E, donde tengo guardas algunas fotos y eso, pero mi problema es el puto C, que acumula muchas carpetas y no entiendo
22/5/20 11:40 - Lorena: escucha descansa ahora que te ibas a dormir, cuando tengas un hueco mañana si podés me ayudas!!
22/5/20 11:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:45 - Joe: Haha ok I’ll look at it more tomorrow. It might also be that you don’t have enough memory/RAM which is different than the long term storage in those drives. 

RAM has a big impact on how fast programs can run. Not having enough will make it run slow.
22/5/20 11:45 - Lorena: mmmm
22/5/20 11:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:46 - Lorena: https://www.pccomponentes.com/msi-px60-6qd-042es-i7-6700hq-16gb-1tb-128-ssd-gtx950m-156
22/5/20 11:47 - Lorena: esta es mi computadora
22/5/20 11:48 - Joe: Specs look pretty good. Hmm, it only is running slow when you use that 3d program?
22/5/20 11:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:49 - Lorena: si, no esta mal... se usa para videojuegos
22/5/20 11:49 - Joe: Or all the time? If it’s only with that program, it’s probably just a super memory intensive program.
22/5/20 11:49 - Lorena: si, solo con ese programa, se me cierra de golpe... o algunas funciones creo que le cuestan... pero lo más importante para mi, es que se me cierra sin avisarme y puedo perder algo en lo que llevo trabajando un rato
22/5/20 11:50 - Joe: I’m thinking that program is probably just insane with the amount of resources it needs. 3D rendering takes a lot of memory
22/5/20 11:50 - Lorena: claro!
22/5/20 11:51 - Lorena: y cual es la solución? liberar espacio?
22/5/20 11:52 - Joe: I have to see if that laptop allows for you to upgrade the ram but you can go from the 16GB you have to 32GB and that might help
22/5/20 11:53 - Lorena: actualizar la tarjeta ram sería mejor que liberar espacio entonces?
22/5/20 11:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:54 - Joe: Yeah because that space that’s full is the long term storage. But i think the problem is with the short term memory/RAM
22/5/20 11:55 - Joe: 30GB remaining right? Not 30GB RAM?
22/5/20 11:55 - Joe: A good way to check would be to open the task manager when you’re using the program and see what it says
22/5/20 11:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:57 - Lorena: esa carpeta > windows> ocupa 30 GB! yo no guardo nada ahi, son los programas y carpetas que se supone que son importantes.. pero no sé hasta que punto.. jaja son demasiados no?
22/5/20 11:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 11:58 - Joe: Well it might not look like it’s in there but If you have any photos and videos they’re usually on the C drive. Just hard to find.
22/5/20 11:59 - Joe: Open the task manager when you have the program open and see if you are using 100% of the memory. Also try not to have google chrome open while using the program cause chrome uses a lot of memory. Maybe try Firefox
22/5/20 11:59 - Lorena: si? yo los guardé en el otro disco, todas las fotos y videos! en el disc D
22/5/20 12:00 - Lorena: mientras uso el programa, tengo 6 páginas de chrome abiertas, spotify, skype, jajaja
22/5/20 12:01 - Joe: Hahaha Ok now I really think it’s the RAM 😂
22/5/20 12:01 - Lorena: CONTROL+ ALT + ?
22/5/20 12:01 - Joe: Delete
22/5/20 12:01 - Lorena: ayudame!!! jajaja
22/5/20 12:02 - Joe: Control + alt + delete then open task manager to check on memory usuage
22/5/20 12:02 - Joe: Usage*
22/5/20 12:03 - Joe: Haha ok I’ll help tomorrow. I’m going to have to actually read up and make sure you get the right stuff. But it’s most likely not enough memory haha
22/5/20 12:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:05 - Lorena: gracias bombón!!!
22/5/20 12:06 - Joe: Hmmm only 51% usage on your memory. Keep that open and if it starts going slow look at it and see if it is at or above 100%
22/5/20 12:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:07 - Lorena: okey, abierto mientras uso el programa entonces, lo haré.. luego te digo!
22/5/20 12:08 - Joe: Haha ok good luuuuck 😚
22/5/20 12:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:09 - Lorena: Perdón mi nariz no para de sonar 😬
22/5/20 12:10 - Joe: Ooooh fancy hahah that’s pretty cool I need something like that
22/5/20 12:10 - Joe: Haha I wasn’t going to say anything 😂 it’s all good

22/5/20 12:13 - Lorena: ahora entiendo por que lo adoras tanto
22/5/20 12:14 - Joe: 😂 I liked him way before he did that...but yeah it made me like him more hahaha.
22/5/20 12:15 - Joe: Ok ok you’re going to get me started hahaha
22/5/20 12:15 - Lorena: lo sé, lo sé! jajaja
22/5/20 12:15 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:16 - Lorena: tormenta?
22/5/20 12:17 - Joe: Oh haha it’s an expression. Basically you’re bringing up a bunch of stuff I like to talk about and I’m about to start talking and not stop haha
22/5/20 12:17 - Lorena: ah jajajaja
22/5/20 12:18 - Lorena: es verdad, mi táctica... códigos y Yang jajaja
22/5/20 12:18 - Joe: Shit it’s working. I was half asleep then i started researching your computer 😂
22/5/20 12:18 - Joe: I’m a fucking nerd
22/5/20 12:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:19 - Lorena: jajaja no lo hice con intención de despertarte! fue mala idea... pero lo hice por no olvidarme, pensé que lo verías despues! jajaja
22/5/20 12:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 12:20 - Joe: Haha ok ok. No worries I have fun talking to you about nerd shit. Have a good day! I’ll talk to you later 😚
22/5/20 19:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

22/5/20 20:30 - Joe: Haha yeah that’s me when I make things at the beach 😂
22/5/20 20:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 20:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 20:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 20:32 - Joe: Hahahaha
22/5/20 20:32 - Joe: How about now? Hahahaha
22/5/20 20:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 20:33 - Lorena: jajajaja
22/5/20 20:33 - Joe: Hahahaha
22/5/20 20:33 - Joe: More sand
22/5/20 21:12 - Lorena: estas con la clase de tu abu?
22/5/20 21:21 - Joe: Siiiiii 👨‍🎓
22/5/20 21:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 21:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: esta bien, depende a que persona se lo digas
22/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: pero sería "tener respeto para que te respeten
22/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: O por ejemplo..."Respeta, (1persona- yo) para que te respeten" (3persona, ellos)... " Respeta, para que te respeten"
22/5/20 21:48 - Joe: Ok haha sounds good. There was some funny stuff today. Like “sordo” I learned because Boom Boom is supposedly deaf but he can hear Nelly from across the house when she says “food is ready” hahaha
22/5/20 21:49 - Joe: We were talking about it in context to a relationship. So one partner saying it to the other.
22/5/20 21:50 - Lorena: cómo, boom boom?
22/5/20 21:50 - Joe: Mi abuelo
22/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: conversación basada en hecho real? tuyo o d tu abuela?
22/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: ellos son boom boom, algo me habías dicho desto, recuerdo
22/5/20 21:53 - Joe: Nelly was talking about her and BoomBoom. We were talking about how they joke around a lot but she has never been offended by him and he has never been offended by here. Because they respect each other.
22/5/20 21:53 - Joe: By her*
22/5/20 21:54 - Lorena: mmm pero boom boom le dice tu abuela a tu abuelo, o ellos dos son boom boom?
22/5/20 21:55 - Lorena: Que lindo, se puede bromear y no faltar el respeto claro, así deberían ser todas las relaciones
22/5/20 21:55 - Joe: Haha boom boom es mi abuelo, Nelly es mi abuela.
22/5/20 21:55 - Lorena: jaja si ya sé que Nelly es tu abuela
22/5/20 21:55 - Lorena: pero boom boom, por que le dicen a tu abuelo así?
22/5/20 21:57 - Joe: Oooh like why do I call him that? I don’t know haha. That’s what everyone in our family had always called him. 

Him and my dad are both named Carlos so maybe to differentiate was the initial reason but I don’t know to be honest
22/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: ahhhhh jaja
22/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: bueno, a ver... audio explicandome que aprendiste
22/5/20 22:01 - Joe: Hahaha shit
22/5/20 22:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: Sordo/ Zurdo
22/5/20 22:16 - Joe: Damn I tried to find a good “thanks teacher” gif. I got nothing hahaha
22/5/20 22:16 - Joe: So I guess I just say, thank you for the tips like a normal human hahaha
22/5/20 22:18 - Lorena: jaja de nada, entendiste lo que te dije o te lo escribo?
22/5/20 22:31 - Joe: Hahaha siii. Sordo is like BoomBoom. Can’t hear. But zudro is like me, left-handed haha
22/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Boom boom, es sordo de verdad?  o es en broma lo de sordo?
22/5/20 22:37 - Lorena: Sos zurdo como mi hermano, yo soy diestra (derecha)
22/5/20 22:38 - Joe: I’m not sure hahah. Doctor says he can’t hear. And he supposedly doesn’t hear or mishears things often. But Nelly was saying she’ll tell him “food is ready” in a normal voice,  not even yelling, and he will come from across the house 😂
22/5/20 22:38 - Joe: So she said he is faking it hahaha
22/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: ahhhh jajaja
22/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: "Boom bom es sordo para lo que quiere"
22/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: para lo que a el le interesa, jajaja
22/5/20 22:39 - Joe: Haha me and Gastón living as left handed people in a right handed world 😂

22/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: áh mierda
22/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: jajaj se escribió eso sin querer, estaba escribiendo con mano izquierda, jajajajaa terrible!!!!!!!!
22/5/20 22:41 - Joe: I wonder if he had the problem of smearing everything he wrote when he was younger too haha. I used to hate that. After writing an essay my hand would be covered in ink 😂 hated it
22/5/20 22:43 - Joe: Haha even with the left hand....how? Hahahaha
22/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: jajaja no sé, estaba aburrida y dije quiero probarlo jajaja

22/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Jajajaj me acabo de sentir como una niña pequeña, no podía agarrar bien el bolígrafo jajaja

23/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: Un beso, pásenlo muy bien! Muakk 😘
23/5/20 8:58 - Lorena: Buenos días 🐚

23/5/20 11:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 11:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 11:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 11:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 11:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 12:12 - Lorena: jajaja te acabas de despertar de una siesta a las 12? uuuo jaja
23/5/20 12:13 - Lorena: que bonito lugaaar Joe! me encanta!
23/5/20 12:13 - Lorena: Quiero bañarme ahi en esa playa turquesa jaja
23/5/20 12:34 - Joe: Haha yeah. Long day got me tired
23/5/20 12:35 - Joe: It was super nice today. I wish to could’ve been here 😔
23/5/20 12:50 - Lorena: Me alegro que te lo hayas pasado bien! 🤗
23/5/20 13:18 - Joe: What are you dooooing today?
23/5/20 13:20 - Lorena: Hoy hice una entrevista a una chica por que se queda libe una habitación
23/5/20 13:20 - Lorena: ahora mismo, somos 3 ( Sandra, Nuria y yo) Nuria, es la loca.. jaja se va por suerte!!
23/5/20 13:22 - Lorena: y vino una chica interesada, y parecía muy simpática, 39 años, buena vibra, trabajadora, le gusta la naturaleza también como a nosotras, los animales, yoga, la cerveza, jaja asi que me dio buenas impresiones! jpero aun no sabemos si se quedará, aunque a ella le encantó la luz de la casa y ubicación
23/5/20 13:30 - Joe: Ooh so interviewing for another roommate? That’s cool. I hope you find someone chill haha
23/5/20 13:32 - Joe: I shouldn’t have slept for so long. I messed up haha.


I saw myself in the mirror a second ago and my hair is all wild and curly 😆 salt water makes my shit curl up hella much. I’m going to miss going in the ocean all the time when I leave
23/5/20 13:35 - Lorena: Si, veremos quién se mete, también había otro chico interesado, pero me da mejor vibra esta chica, ya te contaré que decidimos!
23/5/20 13:36 - Lorena: jajaja a mi me pasó el día que me tomé la puta pastilla de la alergia, te acordás? jajaja pero igual como tus horarios son tan raros, jaja quizá te entre sueño en un rato jajaja
23/5/20 13:38 - Lorena: ah si??? jajaja a ver 👀
23/5/20 13:39 - Joe: Hahah alright sounds good
23/5/20 13:40 - Joe: Yeah probably I’ll fall asleep again soon. Or...hopefully haha
23/5/20 13:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 13:42 - Joe: Weird little pigtail looking curls hahaha
23/5/20 13:44 - Joe: Kind of makes me wonder how long my hair would be if it was straight. It feels like it’s barely getting longer cause it just gets curlier haha
23/5/20 13:45 - Lorena: jajajaja
23/5/20 13:45 - Lorena: muy gracioso ese rulo, parece un resorte
23/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 13:47 - Lorena: liso no, me gustan esos rulos!!!! te queda bien así el pelo mmmm jajaa
23/5/20 13:50 - Joe: Hahaha it just bounces back when I pull it. It’s so weird 😆 

I used to have short hair forever. Only grew my hair out in the last couple of years but I feel like my hair likes being in Hawaii 😂
23/5/20 13:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 13:52 - Joe: Hahaha
23/5/20 13:52 - Joe: Nice. Ok I go back to sleep now hahaha
23/5/20 13:52 - Lorena: 🙄
23/5/20 13:52 - Lorena: Jajaj okey
23/5/20 13:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 13:55 - Lorena: te queda lindo el pelo largo, jaja yo si tengo un hijo en algun momento... si es chico le voy a dejar el pelo largo jajaje
23/5/20 13:58 - Joe: Alright you got me. Now I need to ask since you brought it up haha

What would you like when it comes to having children?
23/5/20 14:02 - Lorena: jajaja no te ibas a dormir?
23/5/20 14:03 - Lorena: mmm que me gustaría?
23/5/20 14:03 - Joe: Well I was going to go to sleep but now I’m interested to know about this haha
23/5/20 14:04 - Lorena: vamos allá, jaja me gustaría tener varios... hijo unico no, me gusta eso de tener hermanos... yo solo tengo uno, pero me hubiese gustado tener dos más por ejemplo, jajaja..
23/5/20 14:07 - Lorena: en cuanto al sexo, espero que esto no suene raro... pero no sé me gustaría que el primero que tenga, sea varón....
23/5/20 14:07 - Joe: Hmm ok. Yeah some brothers would be pretty cool haha
23/5/20 14:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:08 - Lorena: y luego no sé, odio todo el tema este de la sobreprotección, me gustaría criar a mis hijos en contacto con la naturaleza, con respeto de los animales... que sepa hacer varias cosas, no tanto como en la escuela, y compartir viajes.. no sé si me explico
23/5/20 14:08 - Joe: That’s cool. I’d be super stoked on a boy too, that would be the best. But I would be really happy either way
23/5/20 14:09 - Joe: Yeah you’re explaining fine. That sounds very nice
23/5/20 14:12 - Lorena: mmm jaja si hizo mal la traducción. Yo solo tengo un hermano, (Gastón), por eso me gustaría tener más. Y por otro lado, no tendría un hijo solo, desde mi punto de vista, tienen un cariño extra de los padres, no saben lo que es compartir, y poder jugar con otros hermanos, eso puede afectar en sus futuras relaciones, vínculos con la sociedad
23/5/20 14:12 - Lorena: * Se hizo mal la traducción
23/5/20 14:17 - Lorena: jaja mierda, sigo pensando en ello, jajaja estas preguntas me hacen pensar cosas más internas
23/5/20 14:18 - Joe: Haha don’t worry. Tell me more. Tell me anything you think of
23/5/20 14:19 - Joe: Yeah this makes sense. I see where you’re coming from. I like the idea of siblings also
23/5/20 14:19 - Lorena: pero si, que aprendan a hacer cosas de la casa por ejemplo, cosas útiles, no solo jugar con muñecos jaja, que todos aprendan a coser, cocinar, plantar un tomate por ejemplo.... jajaja  y viajar.... en una furgoneta o autocaravana... hacer acampadas, NO a hoteles y playas llenas de gente...
23/5/20 14:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:21 - Joe: Seriously though this sounds really great. I like what you want
23/5/20 14:22 - Lorena: Pequeña Miss Sunshine
23/5/20 14:23 - Lorena: Gracias 😚, y vos que??? te gustaría?y si es así.. cómo?
23/5/20 14:25 - Joe: Hmm🤔 

I always imagined having multiple children. Like 2 or 3.
23/5/20 14:26 - Joe: I don’t know exactly how I want to raise my children. But as long as they are loved and happy and they have what they need, I’ll be happy.
23/5/20 14:27 - Joe: What you described is definitely more of my style though. Camping and stuff instead of hotels and all that.
23/5/20 14:29 - Lorena: 3 es perfecto
23/5/20 14:29 - Lorena: siii, lindo! peeeero jaja eso es muy general, no me das algunos detalles
23/5/20 14:31 - Lorena: bien!!! es que me da una pereza, esas familias que se van de vacaciones, pagan un hotel, sus niños juegan un poco con tanta gente alrededor y vuelven a sus casas...
23/5/20 14:32 - Joe: I never imagined many details. I don’t know...I think it’s because I don’t want to completely control the lives of my children hahah so I don’t want to make up stories in my mind about what they should or shouldn’t be.

But when I see them find interest in positive things I just want to guide them and help them figure out who they are
23/5/20 14:36 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:37 - Lorena: mmm.. parece que me estas diciendo que yo quiera controlar sus vidas...
23/5/20 14:38 - Joe: Hahaha no not at all
23/5/20 14:38 - Lorena: yo te di "detalles", de lo que creo que sería una buena educación, respecto a lo convencional... obviamente intentaría ver sus cualidades para que hagan lo que más les guste y sean felices
23/5/20 14:38 - Joe: Sorry I didn’t mean it that way
23/5/20 14:39 - Joe: No for sure. I know what you’re saying. What you described didn’t sound controlling or anything like that. Some people have the “detail” down to the smallest thing.
23/5/20 14:41 - Joe: Damn...I really didn’t mean to come off like that and I’m really sorry. What you describe sounds like it would give your children more freedom than the average and I really really like that
23/5/20 14:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:44 - Lorena: jaja no pasa nada, podemos pensar de maneras diferentes en algunas cosas jaja, solo que me chocó verlo así, pensé que me decías a mi controlador, jamás haría eso, de hecho las cosas que pienso, son las que me gustaría para que puedan tener más libertad en la vida
23/5/20 14:47 - Joe: Yeah I thought it sounded like a very “free” lifestyle. It’s one that I’m super into hahaha

I don’t know. I just want to help my kids turn into cool little dudes 😂
23/5/20 14:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:49 - Lorena: jajajaja
23/5/20 14:52 - Lorena: y una última cosa jajaja, no sé como serán ahi los padres... pero en esta sociedad, muchas veces los hombres quedan en un segundo plano con sus hijos, las madres parece que lo hacen todo "mejor" únicas e irreemplazables. No estoy para nada de acuerdo con ello, un hijo es de dos, me gustaría que el padre de mi hijo, pueda tener un contacto tan cercano, como el de una mujer.. no sé como.. jaja estaría genial que tenga pechos y pueda tener el también ese vinculo, jaja esto no lo pensé mucho...
23/5/20 14:53 - Lorena: pero es que con lo que te conté, del hermano de Sandra... es super buen hombre, y lo esta pasando muy muy mal, la mujer nunca dejaba que el tome decisiones, y ahora lo aleja de su hijo... todo tiene que ser como ella dice, eso lo detesto!!!
23/5/20 14:53 - Lorena: ( mierda, ahora si me pasé jajaja, pero tenía que decirlo)
23/5/20 14:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 14:56 - Joe: I would do everything I could to be 50/50 with you.

I definitely want to be a big part in my childrens lives. Not just hand them off to the mother haha.
23/5/20 15:00 - Joe: Also my dad was not a very affectionate guy haha. He would be the one to take me to do sports and all that but he was definitely one to fall in the background a bit. He worked hard though and I recognize that. 

But I would like to show my children more affection. I can barely give my dad a hug without him being all weird about it
23/5/20 15:07 - Lorena: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
23/5/20 15:12 - Lorena: Me gusta saber estas cosas, pasa mucho, todas las personas somos diferentes, yo tengo amigas que no tienen contacto con sus abuelas, para mi, mis 3 abuelos, fueron suuuper cariñosos conmigo siempre, yo ahora puedo ser más cariñosa con mi abuela, que con mis padres jaja
23/5/20 15:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 15:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 15:17 - Joe: 😊
23/5/20 15:18 - Joe: I really appreciate that haha cause I really want to be a good dad. I had the weirdest moment working at summer camp last year when I was helping some kid and I thought to myself, “damn I should be a dad or something” haha
23/5/20 15:20 - Joe: I’m trying to teach my own kid how to skate...not everyone else’s hahaha
23/5/20 15:21 - Lorena: jajaja eso es típico, si tenés una hijo no jugaría al futbol, patinaría .. o una hija, lo mismo! jaja
23/5/20 15:23 - Lorena: bueno, jajaja si tuviese que elegir.. serías una buena elección para ser el padre de mis hijos... jaja además podíamos tener la casita con jardín de la que hablamos, y toda la manada de animales jajaja
23/5/20 15:23 - Lorena: Que bonito lo que te acabo de decir eeeeeh, eh jajaja!
23/5/20 15:25 - Joe: That does sound nice and I was not expecting you to say that haha
23/5/20 15:27 - Joe: But thank you 😊 you seem like you’d be a great mom. I would definitely be stoked if you were my kids mom
23/5/20 15:30 - Joe: Ok now I think I can go to sleep hahaha. i enjoyed our talk. Some good information here 😂
23/5/20 15:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 15:31 - Lorena: jajaja gracias, lo bueno es que puede saber dos idiomas seguro! jajaja
23/5/20 15:32 - Lorena: Que duermas muy bien melena con rulos!!! Muuuuak 😘😘😘
23/5/20 15:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 15:32 - Joe: 😘
23/5/20 20:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 21:57 - Lorena: Jsjsjjaj
23/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: Good morning!!!
23/5/20 22:16 - Joe: And good evening to you haha. 

So I was wondering, are there any new updates on opening up over there?
23/5/20 22:32 - Lorena: Estaba con Luchi que vino a mi casa y dimos un paseo, hace re linda noche acá! Me encanta estar con ropa cómoda y ligero con esta temperatura jaja
23/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: Apertura de que?
23/5/20 22:34 - Lorena: Por corona virus?
23/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Glad it’s a nice night. Enjoy it!
23/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Yeah. There is just so much arguing and confusion in the US right now I was just wondering what kind of updates people are getting in other places
23/5/20 22:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:38 - Joe: Hmm ok that sounds reasonable I guess. Everyone here is so divided here it’s hard to come up with a consensus for what we should do. Feels really weird.
23/5/20 22:39 - Joe: Hahahah that runny nose 🤧 must be hellllllaaaa pollen out there
23/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: Si hay mucha confusión, todo se decide a último momento. Toda esta mierda va con fases y se divide por provincias. Madrid es una de las más afectadas, por tanto... Pasamos de fase muy lento. Nos costó 2 meses llevar a fase 1. Se supone que ahora podemos salir sin horario, ya empezaron a abrir muchas tiendas, peluquerías, restaurantes con aforo
23/5/20 22:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:44 - Lorena: Toda esa gente compra pizza o cerveza y lo toma en el banco en la calle jajajaja
23/5/20 22:45 - Lorena: El lunes la situación cambiará, todo se hace de manera desescalada
23/5/20 22:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:49 - Joe: Hahahah damn the whole world is a fucking mess 😂 this shit is so weird. Aaaah can’t wait for it to be over
23/5/20 22:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 22:54 - Joe: So many people. I’m not looking forward to going back to the Bay Area haha. Too many humans everywhere! Fuck
23/5/20 22:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:21 - Lorena: Quédate en Hawaii!
23/5/20 23:22 - Lorena: El surfcamp se suspende?
23/5/20 23:28 - Joe: I wish I could stay. I need to go back though. At least for a few months. Skate camp didn’t get cancelled and I need to film for my video part. 

I’m just feeling a little weird about it though. I just need to stay focused for those few months and try to save up some more money.
23/5/20 23:29 - Joe: I’m getting nervous though cause I’m having a hard time finding a place to stay but I already have my ticket back. Shiiiiiit
23/5/20 23:37 - Lorena: Ohhhhh
23/5/20 23:38 - Lorena: Jaja bueno, está bien volver si tenés trabajo
23/5/20 23:38 - Lorena: Volver a patinar con tus amigos
23/5/20 23:39 - Joe: Yeah I was going to stay with my friend but he rented out his extra room a couple weeks back. Now I’m trying to find something
23/5/20 23:39 - Lorena: Hacer tu parte del vídeo!!!
23/5/20 23:39 - Lorena: El lugar te referís al alquiler d casa?
23/5/20 23:40 - Lorena: Ah perdón no había leído eso de arriba
23/5/20 23:40 - Lorena: Pero que estás buscando, casa o habitación?
23/5/20 23:41 - Joe: I just need a room to rent. But I’m not trying to pay crazy high rent or there is no point cause all the money I make will just go to rent. I’m trying to save up over the summer.
23/5/20 23:43 - Joe: I was going to stay with a friend but they had to rent out their extra room cause they lost hours at work and needed money for rent now. They couldn’t wait until when I get back. 

I don’t know. I’m just hoping I find something reasonable.
23/5/20 23:46 - Lorena: Claro, es que una casa entera para una persona si intentas ahorrar es una opción que hay que descartar!
23/5/20 23:46 - Lorena: Cuánto cuesta una habitación o una casa aprox en la zona donde querés vivir?
23/5/20 23:47 - Lorena: Acá en Madrid habitación de 350 a 450 euros y una casa de 3 habitaciones, unos 900- 1.000eu
23/5/20 23:49 - Joe: Hahahaha whaaaaat!? I should just go to Madrid instead. Renting a single bedroom in a house will most likely be $900-$1200 for me in the Bay Area. A house would be $2000-$4000 😂
23/5/20 23:50 - Lorena: Quee????
23/5/20 23:50 - Lorena: No puede ser
23/5/20 23:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:51 - Lorena: 900 dólares una habitación, pero están locos de la cabeza jajaja
23/5/20 23:51 - Joe: Yes. The Bay Area is absolutely insane with housing prices. It’s completely fucked.
23/5/20 23:51 - Lorena: Una zona super pija
23/5/20 23:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:51 - Lorena: Pero entonces entiendo que el sueldo ahí es más alto
23/5/20 23:51 - Joe: Hahaha
23/5/20 23:53 - Joe: Yeah you can find some really high paying jobs there. My job is kind of in the middle of the pay rate though so I definitely struggle a little when I’m in the Bay Area but that’s true for a lot of people living there. So many big tech companies brought in a bunch of high paid software engineers and they made housing crazy expensive
23/5/20 23:54 - Joe: That’s why I need a good deal on my housing to make it worth it haha.
23/5/20 23:55 - Joe: Damn I can’t believe the housing prices out there. I wonder what it would cost to actually buy a property?

I could live in Madrid in a house by myself for a year or two with just my savings hahaha
23/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:56 - Joe: Hahaha
23/5/20 23:56 - Lorena: Me parece una locura, acá en Madrid mucha gente lucha también para vivir sola, es muy difícil. De hecho en España la gente se independiza súper tarde o tiene que compartir.. si quiere vivir alguien solo en Madrid, tiene que tener un buen sueldo, olvidate de ahorrar
23/5/20 23:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:57 - Joe: Yeah I think that’s the trend all over the world. People needed to stay with roommates or family for way longer than in the past
23/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: Mmmm comprar? Depende la zona...
23/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: 200.000 / 300.000 eu
23/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: Es que depende de la ubicación, estado de la casa, etc
23/5/20 23:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/5/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajajajajaja
23/5/20 23:59 - Lorena: Que divino el pajarito
24/5/20 0:01 - Joe: Lol I guess I should think about leaving the US maybe. If I can keep saving at this rate I should be able to buy something cool in another country haha. But I’ll probably never be able to afford the Bay Area unless there is a housing crisis like the one in 2007/2008
24/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: Mmmm si
24/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: Es que me parece exagerado
24/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: Aunque claro si los salarios son altos... Pero tu trabajo lo bueno es que puede ser desde casa, podrías ganar sueldo de usa y vivir en otro país super bien jajaja
24/5/20 0:04 - Lorena: A mí me gustaría Indonesia o Sri Lanka es super barato para vivir jajaja
24/5/20 0:05 - Joe: Haha unless I end up with a rich wife it’s pretty reasonable thing to think. Go on Zillow or similar real estate website and look at prices near Oakland/San Francisco/Berkeley. Shits crazy
24/5/20 0:07 - Lorena: Jajaja mejor no depender de ninguna esposa rica
24/5/20 0:07 - Joe: Hmmm maybe I’ll need to start thinking about places like this haha. I need to figure this shit out. I know the Bay Area is not my final destination
24/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: Y en Hawaii cuánto cuesta?
24/5/20 0:08 - Joe: Oh I’m not counting on that hahaha. I’m just saying, I can’t afford shit as a single dude in the bay
24/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Jajaj sisiisi, ningún "mortal" con un sueldo promedio es calidad de vida que viva en un sitio tan caro
24/5/20 0:09 - Joe: If you stay really close to town and near the beach it could be similar to the Bay Area but if you find a place a little further out from people you can get good deals still
24/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Tu hermana cuánto paga por su casa?
24/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: 2habitaciones y jardín no?
24/5/20 0:12 - Joe: This place is like an apartment. 2 bedrooms and it has a little back patio area where we grow stuff. It’s about $1200/month but she has been living here for a while and kept her rate. If you move in today rent would be higher.
24/5/20 0:13 - Lorena: Ah bueno, 1200 dólares no está mal tampoco
24/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: 1,100 eu
24/5/20 0:15 - Joe: Yeah she has a good deal here. She’s not leaving any time soon hahah
24/5/20 0:16 - Lorena: Si si, muy bueno
24/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: Ahora en tu zona quizá hay más alquileres disponibles? En Madrid hay más libres porqué mucha gente se fue a otras casas más alejadas o a sus países
24/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: Sin embargo se están llenando rápidamente, hay muchos casos de separaciones y divorcios jajajaja
24/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Hahaha damn that’s a strange reason for housing to be filling up 😂 

People couldn’t stand being locked in a house together
24/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 0:25 - Joe: Hahahaha fuck
24/5/20 0:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 0:28 - Lorena: Jajaja en China también pasó
24/5/20 0:29 - Lorena: Ahora en España
24/5/20 0:33 - Joe: Probably happening here too I would imagine. Aaaah everything is so weird right now. Never would’ve imagined all this one year ago
24/5/20 0:33 - Lorena: Cuando tenés el vuelo a Cali? Cuántas horas de diferencia tenemos nosotros desde ahí?
24/5/20 0:34 - Joe: My flight is on June 8. I have to do a 3 hour layover on another island before flying back into Oakland.
24/5/20 0:34 - Joe: California is 3 hours ahead of Hawaii
24/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: Viajero! Jjj
24/5/20 0:36 - Joe: I still can’t believe we’ve talked as much as we have with a 12 hour time difference haha it’s been fun though
24/5/20 0:37 - Lorena: Mmm tendré que acostumbrarme a ese nueva diferencia horaria...si seguís hablando conmigo! ( Espero que si jaja) 🐻
24/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: Síii jaja, mi horario por las noches algunos días se fue de control jajajaja
24/5/20 0:38 - Joe: Hahaha I can almost guarantee you’ll be the one who stops talking to me first 😂
24/5/20 0:39 - Joe: 😂 yeah it did! You surprised me a few times with how late you stayed up talking to me. I felt bad haha
24/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Por qué??? Jaja
24/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: Jajaja era sin darme cuenta, miraba el reloj y de repente eran las 3 de la mañana, increíble jajaj creo que es lo máximo que salgo por la noche cuando voy a tomar unas cervezas jajaja
24/5/20 0:42 - Joe: I don’t know. You’ll probably just get tired of me talking about my nerd shit hahaha
24/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: Mmmm
24/5/20 0:45 - Lorena: Llevamos hablando como 1 mes y pico.. muchas horas, todos los días, vos que crees?  Jajaja
24/5/20 0:46 - Joe: Haha ok I guess maybe you find some entertainment in my crap. I feel like I talk to much about me I don’t get to hear enough about you. Which is weird cause i don’t like telling people about me haha
24/5/20 0:47 - Joe: I guess I just need to ask more questions if there is anything I want to know though. You’ve been pretty open about everything I ask so far
24/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Jjj hablamos los dos, depende del día uno más que el otro... Jaja me alegro que me cuentes cosas que al resto no... Yo disfruto aprendiendo más cosas d vos y te interesas por las mías, así que es una buena relación
24/5/20 0:53 - Lorena: Si, jaja todo lo que me preguntas te lo respondo lo más sincera posible ... Aunque me digas controladora jajaja 😬
24/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha alright good. If you ever don’t want to hear about something I’m telling you feel free to use that phrase I taught you, “shut the fuck up Joe” 😂
24/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Hahahah duuuude 😂 😂
24/5/20 0:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: Jajaja okey, la usaré cuando lo crea necesario ☝️
24/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: 😈😇
24/5/20 1:05 - Joe: Can’t wait for the first time you actually use it. It’ll quickly become one of your most used phrases when talking to me haha
24/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Jajaja nooo
24/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Me tenés que enseñar más frases, más cosas!
24/5/20 1:10 - Joe: Haha I never come up with good phrases to teach. I’ll think about it and try to send some good ones but if there is a particular topic you need phrases for that could help me narrow it down
24/5/20 1:10 - Joe: Analysis paralysis when deciding what phrases to tell you hahaha
24/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: Sé creativo, o simplemente algo que quieras que te diga
24/5/20 1:13 - Lorena: Ya les hablé a dos amigas de la parálisis de análisis y finalmente les tuve que enviar el vídeo jajaja 🙊
24/5/20 1:14 - Lorena: Me tenés que decir frases, o palabras, incluso música... Siempre te envío yo 😒
24/5/20 1:21 - Joe: Hahahah I’m struggling so much coming up with good stuff. I need a topic there is just too much to choose from
24/5/20 1:22 - Joe: Here is a song while you wait for me to come up with something good. Random phrases are hard to think of. 

https://youtu.be/D--ZSSFMsIg
24/5/20 1:24 - Lorena: Jaja tendrás que elegir algo, lo dicen en el video. Elijas lo que elijas, finalmente acabarás decepcionado jajaja
24/5/20 1:25 - Lorena: Ah el otro día la escuché esta, me gusta mucho!
24/5/20 1:28 - Joe: It came on the radio when I was leaving the beach yesterday. “I wish you were here with me, on a beach in Hawaii”
24/5/20 1:28 - Joe: Hahahahaha
24/5/20 1:29 - Joe: Ok that made me think of a phrase. “That song slaps” or “that shit was slappin’”

Means like, the music is good
24/5/20 1:29 - Joe: Oh and, “this shit smackin” is when food is hella good hahaha. I’ll just teach you Bay Area slang 😂
24/5/20 1:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:32 - Joe: Damn now I need to think of some other good bay slang. People say some funny shit out there
24/5/20 1:34 - Joe: Oh you should say, “this song hella slaps” that would be straight out of Oakland haha
24/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: Jajajaja
24/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: Mmmm
24/5/20 1:36 - Lorena: Expresiones raras, cuando lo puse en el traductor fue como 🧐
24/5/20 1:37 - Joe: Yeah those are very specific slang that doesn’t mean anything in a translator Haha
24/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:38 - Joe: But they’re used often in the bay. But if you go somewhere else people might look at you crazy and not know what you’re talking about haha
24/5/20 1:38 - Lorena: No sé si estoy diciendo sábana
24/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: Hella como se dice así? Jaja
24/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: Haciendo el ridículo si llego a ir algún día a bahía
24/5/20 1:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:41 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/5/20 1:41 - Joe: Hahaha I’m realizing I could talk slang to you and you would have no idea what I’m talking about
24/5/20 1:42 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
24/5/20 1:42 - Joe: Sometimes people will put an “sh” sound on smackin’. Like “shamackin”
24/5/20 1:42 - Joe: “Breakfast was shmackin” hahaha
24/5/20 1:43 - Joe: “Breakfast was hella shmackin” hahah I’m going to send you audio of that
24/5/20 1:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:44 - Joe: Threw a “yo” at the end but it doesn’t mean anything hahaha. “Yo” is a weird slang word that’s hard to describe.
24/5/20 1:45 - Lorena: Jajaj okey necesito escuchar los audios otra vez
24/5/20 1:45 - Joe: Haha don’t worry people only talk this way in specific neighborhoods. It’s not like the whole bay talks like that. It’s less and less common as locals move out of the bay
24/5/20 1:46 - Joe: The rich software engineers that move to the bay from across the country definitely don’t talk that way haha.
24/5/20 1:47 - Lorena: Jajajaja
24/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Fuiejdhfksnsjd
24/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:48 - Joe: Hahaha send me a bad audio clip I don’t mind. It doesn’t need to be perfect.
24/5/20 1:48 - Lorena: Es como si tuviese una patata en la boca
24/5/20 1:49 - Joe: Say it like “that shit was slappen”
24/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Slaaaapin
24/5/20 1:49 - Joe: I bet if you say it like it has “en” at the end it’ll sound perfect
24/5/20 1:49 - Joe: Hahaha siiiiii
24/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Hella slappin yo
24/5/20 1:50 - Joe: That sentence makes zero sense outside of slang hahaha
24/5/20 1:51 - Joe: You’re going to speak English like you grew up in the hood
24/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:52 - Joe: Hahahahah
24/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: Dhgirksjdkdndjdujd
24/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/5/20 1:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Wow that got better really fast
24/5/20 1:55 - Joe: The difference from the first audio to the last is quite a big difference haha. Nice
24/5/20 1:55 - Joe: Hahahah ronronear boludo
24/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: Jajajaj necesitaba decir un insulto pero no, me descargué con ronronear jajajaj
24/5/20 1:57 - Joe: Hahaha best way to relieve the frustration with a ronronear 😂
24/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:02 - Joe: Hahahaha with the voice though 😂
24/5/20 2:03 - Joe: Haha pretty good. You can leave off the “yo” and it’s the same shit. Or you could throw it at the beginning instead like “yooooo that was hella shmackin” 😂
24/5/20 2:04 - Joe: It’s so funny to try to explain slang that I’ve heard and never really questioned whether or not it made sense. Cause it doesn’t make sense hahah
24/5/20 2:05 - Joe: Maybe because when you eat really loud that sound can be called “smacking” sometimes. Who knows 🤷‍♂️
24/5/20 2:06 - Joe: Haha I want you to say this to me if I make you a good breakfast. Please hahaha
24/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:07 - Joe: Yeessss like that. Say that to me when I make you something good 😂
24/5/20 2:07 - Lorena: Intentaré hacerlo, jaja lo apunto en mi cuaderno d notas para cuando te vea y me hagas unas tortitas
24/5/20 2:08 - Lorena: Que tipo de cosas buenas? Sirve para todo? Jaja
24/5/20 2:08 - Joe: Haha not the most useful phrase but I’ll enjoy hearing it
24/5/20 2:09 - Joe: Mostly used for good foods.
24/5/20 2:10 - Joe: It can be used for other stuff but it’s harder to contextualize. Like you could say a house party was smackin
24/5/20 2:10 - Lorena: Jajaj claro, si te gusta la usaré encantada aunque la diga mal
24/5/20 2:11 - Lorena: Jaja okey solo comida mejor
24/5/20 2:12 - Joe: That’s the safest bet haha. Damn it’s going to be sooo long before you can say that to me in person haha fuck
24/5/20 2:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:18 - Lorena: 😔😔😔
24/5/20 2:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:21 - Joe: ❤️
24/5/20 2:29 - Lorena: Mmm no sé, es una mierda no poder salir del país. A vos te darán pasaporte en algún momento?
24/5/20 2:30 - Lorena: Jaja suena bien ese plan juntos en otro país, mientras pase esta mierda
24/5/20 2:30 - Joe: Of course. I was planning on doing it in California but maybe I should just see if I can do it online out here haha
24/5/20 2:32 - Joe: Honestly i would love to do it I’m not even joking
24/5/20 2:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 2:35 - Joe: You know but seriously, it would probably take 2 months to get a passport and id need to get a ticket so it could be 3, maybe 4 total. I think if we’re still talking at that time we should really talk about what the plan should be. Unless you just want to talk to me from far away forever haha I hope that’s not the case
24/5/20 2:36 - Joe: I mean, we should plan sooner rather than later but I’m just saying....I’m willing to take a chance and go anywhere, do anything, and just spend some time with you
24/5/20 2:37 - Joe: Cause it sounds like fun and it would make for a good story no matter what happens in the end haha
24/5/20 2:38 - Lorena: Yooo Hella good, hella sweet!
24/5/20 2:39 - Lorena: Jajaja perdón
24/5/20 2:39 - Lorena: En realidad tengo pensado solo hablar contigo...
24/5/20 2:40 - Lorena: Jaja mentira es broma, me pongo nerviosa ...
24/5/20 2:40 - Lorena: En realidad yo también tengo ganas de verte, muchas
24/5/20 2:41 - Joe: Haha fooled me for a second.
24/5/20 2:42 - Joe: I understand the nervous joke. I’m all about the nervous joke hahah that’s my shit
24/5/20 2:42 - Lorena: Es como muy muy raro, porqué no te conozco en persona pero me gustas, y tendría confianza por ejemplo a darte un abrazo o sonreirte jaja siento como si fueses alguien que ya conozco
24/5/20 2:43 - Lorena: Pero no hablamos mismo idioma 🤯!
24/5/20 2:43 - Lorena: Pero a pesar de todo, puedo plantearme verte, hablo más horas con vos ahora mismo que con otra persona, incluso más que con mis amigas 🙊
24/5/20 2:43 - Joe: Hey I’m getting better fast ok. I still have 3-4 months to improve haha
24/5/20 2:45 - Lorena: 💚 sos lo más!
24/5/20 2:47 - Joe: Haha ok I understand. I don’t really know what to say so I’m just going to say nothing at all 😂
24/5/20 2:48 - Lorena: Qué, qué??
24/5/20 2:48 - Lorena: No bromas! Jajaja
24/5/20 2:51 - Lorena: Tengo un deseo! Quiero que me grabes un video diciéndome lo que me dijiste antes, quiero escucharlo jajaja así lo reproduciré cuando tenga ganas de verte... Porfiiii 🙏
24/5/20 2:51 - Joe: Haha ok we’ll see how you feel in another month.

24/5/20 2:51 - Joe: Haha which one?
24/5/20 2:52 - Lorena: Quiero hacerlo!!! Si ahora dejase de hablar con vos estaría 🥺 jajaja
24/5/20 2:53 - Lorena: Jaja lo de vernos que lo decís en serio, viaje, etc
24/5/20 2:55 - Lorena: Me gusta verte, y como no te tengo ahora... Te voy a hacer que pases un poquito de vergüenza ( o no) repitiendome eso por video
24/5/20 2:55 - Joe: Hahahah alright shiiiit
24/5/20 2:55 - Joe: Oh god
24/5/20 2:56 - Lorena: 🤥🤥🤥

24/5/20 3:04 - Joe: Not a great video hahah but I took it for you. Now if it would just send
24/5/20 3:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:07 - Joe: Sorry I don’t know why it took so long to send. But you’ll have something to watch in the morning. I totally ruined the video haha.

Buenas noches 😘
24/5/20 3:09 - Lorena: Jajaja no me puedo concentrar con la música del fondo
24/5/20 3:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:10 - Joe: Haha it’s a movie
24/5/20 3:10 - Lorena: Me da miedo jajaja
24/5/20 3:10 - Joe: 😂
24/5/20 3:10 - Joe: I’ll make one with less scary music and original thoughts another time.
24/5/20 3:13 - Lorena: Jajajja
24/5/20 3:13 - Lorena: Gracias por grabarlo influencer de YouTube!

24/5/20 3:14 - Joe: Hahahahaha shit dude
24/5/20 3:15 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:15 - Lorena: Jajajaja
24/5/20 3:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:17 - Joe: Hahahahaha what the fuck!?
24/5/20 3:17 - Joe: Hahahahaha
24/5/20 3:18 - Lorena: Jajajajaja estaba buscando esos aviones con los que vos "jugás" y apareció esto tenía que enviarlo jajaja
24/5/20 3:19 - Joe: Hahah it’s a good one. I definitely did not expect that.
24/5/20 3:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:19 - Joe: Whoops didn’t see the end haha gross
24/5/20 3:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:21 - Lorena: sé tus puntos débiles jajaja para atraer tu atención 😏😏
24/5/20 3:22 - Joe: Hahaha dammit! Ok I’ll shut up now 🤐
24/5/20 3:22 - Lorena: Taaaardeee
24/5/20 3:22 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/5/20 3:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:24 - Joe: I say this shit way too much now haha
24/5/20 3:24 - Lorena: Te acordarás cuando tengas tiempo que me tenés que ayudar con la tarjeta gráfica? El otro día no pude casi usar el 3d, las letras de los comandos tardaban en salir  😭
24/5/20 3:24 - Lorena: Jajaja como no...
24/5/20 3:25 - Lorena: Jajajaja cada vez que abras un aguacate podrido te acordarás
24/5/20 3:25 - Joe: Hmm yeah I can help. Did you see if your memory was maxed out when it was going slow?
24/5/20 3:25 - Lorena: *teclas, no letras
24/5/20 3:26 - Lorena: No.. se quedaba en un 40% aprox pero como tampoco funcionaba bien.. al final lo terminé cerrando
24/5/20 3:27 - Joe: 🤔 I’m not really sure what is making it go so slow to the point if crashing if it’s not the memory.
24/5/20 3:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:29 - Lorena: Bueno cuando tengas un ratito, con el ordenador delante me decís que tengo que hacer 🙏
24/5/20 3:29 - Joe: I wonder if you could upgrade your graphics card? Or use an external GPU?
24/5/20 3:29 - Lorena: Ni idea jajaja
24/5/20 3:30 - Lorena: No externa no
24/5/20 3:30 - Joe: Ok. I’m trying to get an idea of the requirements for the program.
24/5/20 3:30 - Lorena: Lo que viene en el ordenador
24/5/20 3:30 - Lorena: https://www.pccomponentes.com/msi-px60-6qd-042es-i7-6700hq-16gb-1tb-128-ssd-gtx950m-156
24/5/20 3:31 - Lorena: Ese es el modelo, tal cual está así lo compré
24/5/20 3:31 - Lorena: Puedo actualizar la tarjeta y averiguar y liberar espacio del disco C. Así con esas dos cosas igual funciona mejor?
24/5/20 3:33 - Joe: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/I don’t know if you can find the support page in spanish but they have some solutions for when the program is running slow. support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-5704C695-6270-4273-B178-88DA8E26689D-htm.html

24/5/20 3:34 - Lorena: Mmm mañana cuando me despierte, mientras desayuno miraré esto! Y probare
24/5/20 3:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 3:35 - Joe: Let me know if it works. It looks like there is some good stuff for different situations
24/5/20 3:36 - Joe: Haha I love it. Half the battle is learning how to get really good at using google.

Most of web development is knowing what to google hahaha
24/5/20 3:36 - Lorena: Okey en mi mañana te hablo( es decir, en unas horas jaja)
24/5/20 3:37 - Joe: Aaaah oh no I did it again hahah. Go to sleep! It’s so late there
24/5/20 3:38 - Lorena: Jajaja 🤓👨🏻‍💻
24/5/20 3:38 - Lorena: Si hoy me dormí una buena siesta por la alergia, pero ahora ya me entró sueño
24/5/20 3:39 - Lorena: Jaja vida de cuarentena sin responsabilidades aún no pasa nada jajaja
24/5/20 3:40 - Joe: Haha oh yeah I guess that’s true. No much to do anyway
24/5/20 3:40 - Lorena: Gracias por el video pinocho, un besoo 😘
24/5/20 3:41 - Joe: Yo no soy pinocho 😂 

Buenas noches 😘
24/5/20 3:42 - Lorena: Jajaja okiii, un beso melenitas con rulos! 😘
24/5/20 9:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 10:45 - Joe: Buenos días. I took a nap at the wrong time again haha. My sleep schedule is way off
24/5/20 10:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 10:49 - Lorena: jajajaja el perrito
24/5/20 10:50 - Lorena: otra vez siesta fuera de hora 🙈
24/5/20 10:53 - Joe: Aaaah I couldn’t help it. I was so tired. I fell asleep so early like a damn grandpa 👴🏽
24/5/20 10:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 10:58 - Lorena: jajajaja abuelo metido en el cuerp de un chico de 30
24/5/20 10:58 - Lorena: jajaja quiero a todos esos perritos!
24/5/20 11:01 - Lorena: mi amiga Luchi, viene a vivir a mi casa 1 mes, no esta bien con su novio... y viene con Rogel!!!
24/5/20 11:02 - Joe: Hahah niiiiice!
24/5/20 11:05 - Joe: Is that who is taking that open spot you were interviewing for? At least for the next month then?
24/5/20 11:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 11:13 - Lorena: Nooo, Luchi es mi amiga!!!
24/5/20 11:13 - Lorena: La dueña de Rogel ( el perro) jaja
24/5/20 11:14 - Joe: Oh I know it’s your friend and dog. I was just wondering if they’re taking that spot or staying with you like, in addition to looking for that other person haha
24/5/20 11:14 - Lorena: me encantan los abuelos bailarines! principalmente este jaja
24/5/20 11:15 - Lorena: Tenemos 3 habitaciones en la casa, Luchi viene solo un mes, y luego vuelve con su novio jaja
24/5/20 11:15 - Lorena: ibamos a buscar a una persona fija, pero como ella es mi amiga, la ayudaré a que pueda estar un mes en nuestra casa
24/5/20 11:16 - Lorena: aunque hay malas noticias, la chica que vino ayer a hacer la entrevista, nos gustó, pero ella encontró una habitación con baño privado! aunque fue super simpatica, me mando un audio, agradeciendo, y diciendo que le hubiese gustado mucho venir por la buena energía
24/5/20 11:16 - Joe: Aah ok. Makes sense
24/5/20 11:17 - Joe: Oh that’s unfortunate. I guess they had no choice once they found a place with a private bathroom though. That’s always really nice to have haha
24/5/20 11:18 - Lorena: Si, yo le dije que me alegraba por ella, que yo hubiese tomado la misma decisión!
24/5/20 11:20 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrTPy6H6oqI
24/5/20 11:20 - Lorena: estoy enamorada de el, jajaja
24/5/20 11:23 - Joe: Hahaha the old man is killing it 😂
24/5/20 11:23 - Joe: The full video is hella good hahah
24/5/20 11:25 - Joe: Hahahaha when he starts dancing with 2 ladies at once 😂 😂 😂
24/5/20 11:26 - Lorena: jajaja si, pero mi momento preferido sin duda es cuando tira las muletas al aire, y se agarra el pelo
24/5/20 11:26 - Lorena: 0.06 😍
24/5/20 11:28 - Lorena: jajajaja el sabe como llamar la atención de ellas!
24/5/20 11:29 - Joe: Hahah yeah that part is hella good too. Old man is a pretty cool dude
24/5/20 11:29 - Joe: Big time ladies man
24/5/20 11:30 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd55PWEp9hM&t=51s
24/5/20 11:33 - Lorena: I would be screaming and cheering a lot! Hahaha
24/5/20 11:35 - Joe: Haha I like your energy. I would sit there and clap along quietly while you make all the noise and cheer 😆
24/5/20 11:35 - Joe: Damn....these old people can really dance haha
24/5/20 11:38 - Lorena: JAJAJAJA
24/5/20 11:42 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvA2RNci3SE
24/5/20 11:43 - Lorena: Youtube tiene tantos videos, que me atrapa
24/5/20 11:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 11:46 - Joe: I wish YouTube had more competition but it’s cool for now haha
24/5/20 11:49 - Lorena: jajaja si me pasa lo mismo!
24/5/20 11:49 - Lorena: es verdad, no tiene competencia...
24/5/20 11:50 - Lorena: mierda, me encantan los musicos callejeros
24/5/20 11:53 - Joe: Haha street music is cool. I wish there was more of that out here. I feel like I don’t see it very often. Maybe a dude playing a ukulele once in a while
24/5/20 12:05 - Lorena: Joe, cual sería?
24/5/20 12:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:07 - Joe: Nvidia
24/5/20 12:07 - Lorena: 💙
24/5/20 12:07 - Joe: What did you find out?
24/5/20 12:08 - Lorena: Nada aun, jaja voy a actualizar tarjeta gráfica por las dudas
24/5/20 12:08 - Lorena: como puedo ver ese cambio? antes de actualizar y despues de actualizar? hay alguna ventana que pueda decirme si realmente hizo cambio?
24/5/20 12:08 - Joe: Oh oook
24/5/20 12:09 - Lorena: me refiero a valores, números, que me digan si cambia algo o no jaja
24/5/20 12:11 - Joe: Open start menu
24/5/20 12:12 - Joe: Click or type the “run” command
24/5/20 12:12 - Joe: Then type “dgdiag”, without the quotes, and click ok
24/5/20 12:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:15 - Joe: Lame
24/5/20 12:16 - Joe: Worked for me. But it’s ok. Another way
24/5/20 12:16 - Lorena: no importa, lo actualizo
24/5/20 12:16 - Lorena: es que cuando hago cosas, me gusta ver si algo cambia para ver si lo hice bien o realmente sirvió
24/5/20 12:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:19 - Joe: Oh it’s ok I found an easy way. Device manager -> display adapters -> nvidia -> driver
24/5/20 12:19 - Lorena: perfecto
24/5/20 12:19 - Lorena: voy a probar
24/5/20 12:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:22 - Joe: Yup that’s it. “Versión del controlador”
24/5/20 12:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:23 - Lorena: le dí a actualizar, y es el mismo controlador, no hizo cambio entonces?
24/5/20 12:23 - Lorena: así se actualiza la tarjeta gráfica?
24/5/20 12:24 - Joe: Doesn’t look like it but that might be the latest version. One second
24/5/20 12:26 - Joe: GeForce.com/drivers
24/5/20 12:27 - Joe: But a lot of their is a warning that says backup your system before updating the card
24/5/20 12:27 - Joe: But their is a warning*
24/5/20 12:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 12:27 - Joe: There* fuck I’m tired haha
24/5/20 12:28 - Lorena: jaja, no te preocupes!!!
24/5/20 12:28 - Lorena: anda a dormir, hablamos en otro momento!!!
24/5/20 12:28 - Lorena: miraré algún video y lo averiguaré!
24/5/20 12:28 - Lorena: Buenas nochesss!!!
24/5/20 12:28 - Joe: Haha I’m not going to fall asleep though. I’m just drowsy. My nap was too long to fall asleep right now
24/5/20 12:29 - Lorena: 😘😘😘
24/5/20 12:29 - Joe: But....I would say you should try to do the things that the 3dsmax website suggested
24/5/20 12:31 - Joe: The docs for 3dsmax have a whole thing about performance issues and possible fixes.

 http://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/index.html?url=files/GUID-5704C695-6270-4273-B178-88DA8E26689D.htm,topicNumber=d30e597570
24/5/20 12:39 - Lorena: 👍🏻 gracias!
24/5/20 12:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 20:36 - Joe: Hola! Any luck with getting your program to not run hella slow?

I found a free spanish course online so I’m starting that today haha
24/5/20 20:48 - Lorena: Buenos días!
24/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: Lo único que hice fue actualizar la tarjeta gráfica, y borrar archivos (temp) jaja por que luego estuve ocupada montando esto...
24/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 20:50 - Lorena: jajaja ventilador!!! yo siempre viví en zona de montaña, y acá en el centro de la ciudad hace demasiado calooooor, asi que llevo pegada a el toda la tarde jajaja
24/5/20 20:52 - Lorena: Ah si? como se llama? yo empecé con Bassu ayer, te lo iba a decir.. que te lo hagas, es para español también! si te interesa luego te paso un link
24/5/20 20:55 - Joe: Bahahah 😂
24/5/20 20:57 - Joe: Uuuh definitely interested. Pass me the link! Mine is just “basic spanish” on this website EDX. https://www.edx.org
24/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: tiene buena pinta!
24/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 21:00 - Joe: Yeah EDX is a big website. I’ve taken other courses on it for programming. You can take courses from places like Harvard for free on that site
24/5/20 21:02 - Joe: But I’ll still check out busuu. The more content the better. Let’s me see the same thing explained in different ways
24/5/20 21:03 - Lorena: Me gusta esto de los cursos, siempre tengo alguna página! una que igual te gustaría, aunque es de pago.. pero muy poco.. Domestika
24/5/20 21:04 - Joe: Edx.org/schools-partners
24/5/20 21:04 - Lorena: Esto es básico, quería ver como era la app.. pero sin embargo hace pequeñas explicaciones al final de pronunciación y entonación, y eso si me pareció interesante..
24/5/20 21:04 - Joe: You can take a lot of the courses for free on EDX but you don’t get a certificate
24/5/20 21:05 - Lorena: el certificado no importa
24/5/20 21:06 - Lorena: https://www.domestika.org/es/courses/category/9-tecnologia
24/5/20 21:08 - Joe: Truuueee. I’ve never paid for any of the courses from EDX. I just need the knowledge not the paper haha
24/5/20 21:10 - Joe: Sweet. I’ll check this out. I would like to have my own courses online eventually. I don’t even know what I’d teach haha but it’d be cool to share something I know and make a few bucks doing it.
24/5/20 21:19 - Lorena: jajajaj como te gusta la cámara eh amiguito!
24/5/20 21:20 - Lorena: Podrías empezar a hacerlo,me parece perfecto... siempre hay gente interesada en aprender cosas a través de internet
24/5/20 21:22 - Joe: Hahah I had to practice to get comfortable with a camera. I actually really don’t like it 😂 

But it’s a great way to communicate with a larger audience on the internet nowadays. Have to take advantage of it while you can
24/5/20 21:26 - Lorena: si haces algo aunque sea de tu profesión,  te apoyaré, pondré los subtitulos y daré visualizaciones jaja
24/5/20 21:26 - Lorena: lo próximo si queremos ganar unos dolares/euros, sería hacer unos videos pronunciando español/inglés, como la rubia tonta... jajaja nos haríamos de oro!
24/5/20 21:28 - Joe: Damn...I really appreciate that. You’re the best
24/5/20 21:29 - Joe: Hahaha that’d be hella good. Making YouTube videos is pretty fun. I was started to make a few bucks off of them from my skateboard channel before they changed the rules hahah. I should get back on that and get that passive income flowing
24/5/20 21:30 - Joe: The only thing is you have to make a video almost everyday or your channel doesn’t get much traction. It’s really not that hard to get it going though if you can come up with some decent content and you’re active in an online community like a forum or something related to the topic of your channel
24/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: ❤️
24/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: mmm no estoy muy puesta en eso, sé que todo tiene una posición y bueno con palabras se puede hacer viral, o bueno manteniendo contenido como vos decis y con seguidores fieles
24/5/20 21:36 - Lorena: ya no subis más videos no? podrías aprovechar en Hawaii
24/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 21:38 - Joe: Going viral isn’t too important. It’s more about getting a solid base of subscribers that watch all your stuff. An occasional viral video will help grow the channel faster but not really necessary.
24/5/20 21:38 - Joe: Yeaaah I really should’ve started making videos when I came out here but I don’t have a camera anymore cause mine broke haha.
24/5/20 21:39 - Joe: Hahahah thanks for subscribing 😂
24/5/20 21:39 - Joe: Don’t forget to smash that like button hahaha
24/5/20 21:39 - Lorena: ah pero no se gana más dinero? con un video viral?
24/5/20 21:40 - Lorena: con el iphone, seguro que algo decente podés sacar, si contas algo muy interesante o mostras algo quizá los seguidores, no esten tan preocupados por la calidad
24/5/20 21:41 - Joe: Yeah you make more from a viral video but the real key is building a consistent library of videos. Viral videos only help so much because a lot of the people that find them aren’t really that interested in the content of the channel but just that specific video.
24/5/20 21:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 21:42 - Joe: I can’t do it haha I really notice the quality. Especially if things like the audio so I need a microphone like I was using before. But iPhone video quality should work fine.
24/5/20 21:42 - Joe: Hahaha fuck
24/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: ah claro por el ruido!
24/5/20 21:43 - Joe: You’d be surprised how many people comment on a video with bad quality saying it needs to improve
24/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: jaja cualquiera que me conozca, me diria, lore que haces siguiendo un canal de helicopteros? jajaja
24/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: aviones de juguete, dron o como se llamen jajajaa
24/5/20 21:44 - Lorena: y como ganas dinero con estos canales, si te dan me gusta por ejemplo o visualización?
24/5/20 21:44 - Joe: Hahaha I’ll probably never post to the RC channel again 😂 but thanks for subscribing haha
24/5/20 21:46 - Joe: You get paid per view. What category the content is determines how much you get per view. Pretty sure technology videos and makeup videos get the highest pay per view on YouTube.
24/5/20 21:46 - Lorena: oouuch
24/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: odio con toda mi alma, los videos de maquillaje
24/5/20 21:47 - Joe: Hahahaha good, I’m glad you hate them. But just know, they make a lot of money from those 😂
24/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: y los que explican programas con musica horrible de fondo, como electronica o techno, lo detesto también jaja
24/5/20 21:48 - Joe: Hahah yeah that sounds annoying
24/5/20 21:48 - Joe: I’m going to make you a YouTube channel one of these days 😂 you’ll have to learn to be in front of the camera haha
24/5/20 21:49 - Lorena: Si, por productos de pelo, yo alguna vez tuve que entrar, no me suelo maquillar... pero dios... 20 minutos de video para decir algo que se puede decir en 1 minuto... me ponen realmente de malhumor las chicas que hacen esos videos, tan forzado todo
24/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: jajaja nah... yo no.🙈 en todo caso diré " that shit was slappen" y vos " ronronear" y seguro que ganamos dinero haciendo el ridículo y podemos viajar juntos a algún lado
24/5/20 21:51 - Lorena: contamos la historia como nos conocimos, y más de alguna adolescente se engancharía a nuestro canal jajaja
24/5/20 21:53 - Joe: Haha its pretty hard to come off natural when making a YouTube video 😂 

You know what I would watch? Two people living together that don’t speak the same language. 

Not saying we should do this but I’d watch it hahah
24/5/20 21:55 - Joe: Hahahah we’ll make the “two people that don’t understand each other travel the world together” channel. 

Probably get some pure gold out of that haha
24/5/20 21:58 - Lorena: ( pues en los videos que hiciste, te vi bastante natural)
24/5/20 22:00 - Lorena: jajajjajaa, vos sos el rey de youtube, yo te haría caso... tenés buen material durante este tiempo
24/5/20 22:00 - Joe: That’s because I film them when I’m by myself mostly. That’s when I’m in my natural element. When no one is around hahaha
24/5/20 22:02 - Lorena: Chica uruguaya vive en Madrid, chico californiano en Hawaii, se conocen por internet durante la cuarenta, con 12 horas de diferencia horaria y sin saber el idioma del otro, y planean conocerse jajaja
24/5/20 22:02 - Joe: I’m telling my friends you said I’m the king of YouTube hahahah. I’ve tried to convince them for years that we should be making short YouTube videos. 1 or 2 a week would’ve been enough to build a decent channel. And if everyone actually did their part it’d be easy. 

They didn’t believe you could make money though. Even when I showed them I was starting to make money haha. Before they changed the rules, now you need 1000+ subscribers before they pay you for views
24/5/20 22:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 22:03 - Joe: Hahahahah
24/5/20 22:04 - Lorena: jajaja un nerd experimentado! bueno seguro se te ocurre algo diferente para poder hacerlo
24/5/20 22:04 - Joe: Dude....we’re going to have to make that video. If we get the plans to see each other settled I’ll start documenting more to make something. Even if it’s just for us to look back on and enjoy
24/5/20 22:05 - Lorena: jajaja sería genial
24/5/20 22:06 - Joe: Don’t be surprised if I ask you to record a video with your thoughts about something haha
24/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: 😮😮😮
24/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: jajaja
24/5/20 22:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/5/20 22:09 - Lorena: esto es de ahora? no puede ser... que puto asco de gente!!!! pero las discotecas y lugares así no estan cerrados?
24/5/20 22:11 - Joe: There is so much different stuff going on between the states. Some states are super strictly locked down while others are not taking it as seriously. This is in the state of Missouri yesterday
24/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: alucinante... que poca conciencia tiene la gente, sdnklnsdlk
24/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjoXKnoiFr0
24/5/20 22:14 - Lorena: Viste este video? increíble como habla ese niño tan pequeño, como se explica.. es italiano, tiene cosas parecidas al español, de todos modos este video tienen los subtitulos en inglés para que lo puedas ver
24/5/20 22:26 - Joe: Damn that was a pretty good video. Little dude is hella cool. Thanks for sending that. Really interesting
24/5/20 22:29 - Joe: Half of my country thinks the disease is a hoax or that it is being blown out of proportion by the media
24/5/20 22:30 - Joe: I understand some of the doubt. At the beginning our government and media were telling us things like, “there is no proof it can be transmitted between people” and “wearing a mask doesn’t help” before reversing and saying the opposite and mandating that everyone wear a mask

So much bad information is causing confusion and leaving doubt in people’s mind about needing to follow the rules
24/5/20 22:31 - Joe: Plus America has always been full of people with a, “don’t tell me what to do” attitude. Our country was founded on that attitude haha
24/5/20 22:32 - Joe: But that doesn’t mean they aren’t a bunch of dummies. Cause they are and they’re making things worse. But I understand, somewhat, their mindset, even though I don’t agree with it
24/5/20 22:37 - Lorena: de nada liiindo, me alegro que te interesen los vídeos que te envío!
24/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: si, se hicieron las cosas muy mal, muchos intereses, nosotros acá también pensábamos lo mismo!
24/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: pero cuando ves que gente en China, en Italia, empieza a morir... tenés que ser consciente de la situación
24/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: A mi me jode mucho toda esta historia del corona virus, por que sé que no sabemos ni la mitad de lo que nos cuentan... y me da mucha tristeza la gente que muere, se suicida, o pierde sus casas y negocios, eso es terrible
24/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: pero no queda más remedio, que hacer caso... dentro de lo que cabe...
24/5/20 22:41 - Joe: Yeah suicides are waaaaay up here in the US right now and businesses are closing fast
24/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: pero yo que estoy viviendo esto muy cerca, estoy viendo como la gente en la calle sigue haciendo lo que quiere,  hay gente imbecil en estados unidos, en españa. siempre hay un porcentaje de gente que complica las cosas
24/5/20 22:43 - Joe: I don’t know it just seems messed up. Like a lot of big chain stores remained open while the mom and pop stores were forced to close. The virus is real and terrible but the economic impact is going to last a loooong time. 

So many jobs lost which will lead to more depression and suicides. They need to start giving people money because many have nothing and there is no end in sight.
24/5/20 22:45 - Joe: True. But I don’t expect 100% of people or even close to 100% of people to comply


Humans vary so much in their thinking and value systems that this kind of dysfunction is almost to be expected when trying to get everyone on the same page
24/5/20 22:52 - Lorena: Si, a ver como conseguimos que nuestros países puedan volver a generar trabajos y dinero. En España lo que se dice, es que estos próximos meses la gente tiene que viajar por el país, para generar turismo entre otras provincias, consumir en locales con fabricación en España y demás cosas, pero al final será dificil...
24/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: si totalmente, jaja hay veces que me cuesta entender como reacciona la gente, pero si, cuesta ponerse de acuerdo!
24/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: rulitos, voy a cenar, te hablo luego! muakkk
24/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: ( como se dice rulitos, en ignlés)
24/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: *Inglés
24/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: traductor dice rulits jaja asi?
24/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: curlers sería?
24/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: ah ahora si aparece, curls no?
24/5/20 22:55 - Joe: Haha I don’t understand how this plan works? They want people to travel but they don’t have money to travel hahaha
24/5/20 22:56 - Joe: Oook enjoy dinner. I’ll talk to you later 😚
24/5/20 22:56 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️
24/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: Ahora empieza el verano, habrá gente que no viaje, pero habrá gente que si, sería que esa gente viaje dentro del país para que se genere más dinero
24/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: Rulos ( es la forma del pelo que me enseñaste el otro día) rulitos ( es como más cariñoso, por el uso del diminutivo)
24/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Curls? Like my hair? Haha wait never mind don’t answer. Go enjoy dinner you can get back to me later haha
24/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: 👆🏻🤙🏼
24/5/20 22:59 - Lorena: Muak
24/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: 🐻
25/5/20 0:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:04 - Lorena: 🙊
25/5/20 0:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:04 - Joe: Hahah I had to send it. I didn’t expect it when I saw it
25/5/20 0:05 - Joe: How was dinner?
25/5/20 0:05 - Lorena: jjjj
25/5/20 0:06 - Lorena: bien!! suave, tampoco tenía demasiada hambre, tomé un sandwich con una cerveza con Sandra
25/5/20 0:06 - Lorena: -1 pt  jaja
25/5/20 0:07 - Joe: Hahaha damn
25/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:10 - Joe: Haha whaaaat? I must have a really bad score. I thought it was going well 🤔 hahaha
25/5/20 0:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:11 - Lorena: Jajaja
25/5/20 0:11 - Joe: I knew you’d stop talking to me first hahaha I’m one bad gif away from being cutoff 😂
25/5/20 0:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:13 - Joe: Hahahaha nice
25/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: Mmmm no sé eh, jaja hay muchos buenos. Creo que uno no es suficiente para dejar de hablarte
25/5/20 0:15 - Joe: Haha what if I was bad at sending gifs from the start? Would that have been a deal breaker?
25/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: Seguramente
25/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: Jajajaja
25/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: Si muchos gifs son malos, no tendríamos el mismo humor, y eso no es divertido
25/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Hahah damn good thing I didn’t pick a bunch of stupid gifs at first 😂 

I’ll send the bad ones when it’s too late to change your mind hahaha
25/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Haha yeah I totally get it. I feel the same way. If the humor doesn’t connect it’s hard to just be relaxed and have fun talking
25/5/20 0:20 - Lorena: Jajaja vos también podés decirme cuándo envío algunos malo, así se si pierdo puntos o no
25/5/20 0:22 - Lorena: 💃🕺claaaro, es importante!
25/5/20 0:22 - Joe: So far so good haha
25/5/20 0:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:28 - Lorena: jajaja los canguros son superiores! jaja
25/5/20 0:29 - Joe: Fuck...apparently. That thing looks like it’s on steroids bahah
25/5/20 0:34 - Joe: When we make our super famous YouTube channel we’ll have to go see some kangaroos somewhere 😂 😂
25/5/20 0:50 - Lorena: jajajaja si!
25/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: grabaré cuando el canguro te haga esto
25/5/20 0:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 0:55 - Joe: Hahaha that would definitely be a viral video 😂
25/5/20 0:56 - Joe: Have you ever seen a kangaroo up close? I’ve never seen one. Doesn’t look like a good idea to get too close to them haha
25/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: jajaja no, nunca ví ninguno tampoco!
25/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: En Australia esta lleno, pero no me fio nada de ellos jajaja
25/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: me despido ya, me estoy quedando dormida.. mucho rato mirando que programas y carpetas puedo eliminar, jaja y haciendo lo que dicen los videos, investigando jaja y me mató! 🤯
25/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: mañana estamos en fase1, soy libreee, me iré a la sierra!
25/5/20 1:16 - Lorena: Y veré a mis perras!!!!
25/5/20 1:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Haha alright. Well you should get some good rest then. Tomorrow will be fun for you. Don’t forget about me now that you’re free 😂
25/5/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: Jajaj si, me voy a dormir ya así mañana me levanto temprano!!!

25/5/20 19:09 - Joe: Damn that looks nice! Must’ve felt really good getting out there after being locked up.
25/5/20 19:12 - Joe: Haha not a Hawaiian flower but still looks great on you!
25/5/20 19:13 - Joe: It looks super nice out there. Way different than Madrid haha

25/5/20 22:48 - Lorena: Deberías estar acá vos
25/5/20 22:48 - Lorena: Ya estoy en la ciudad, mañana quiero abrir un poco el 3dmax y el finde volveré
25/5/20 22:49 - Lorena: Jijiji
25/5/20 22:53 - Joe: Haha fuck I wish! I was thinking about how it sucks that this covid shit is keeping me from being able to go see you, then I realize I wouldn’t even know you if it wasn’t for covid hahah
25/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: Jajajajajaja
25/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: Yo me alegro taaaanto de haberte conocido!

25/5/20 22:59 - Joe: Naaaaaaah. Spill the beans haha
25/5/20 22:59 - Joe: Is it working better yet?
25/5/20 23:00 - Lorena: Jajaj esa expresión que significa?
25/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Una puta mierda aún, pero mañana lo abriré y veré realmente si funciona o no
25/5/20 23:03 - Joe: Haha oh yeah. Spill the beans is like to say, “tell me everything”
25/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: Jajajaj okey
25/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: Les hablé a mis mejores amigas d vos en persona hoy
25/5/20 23:05 - Joe: Ooooh boy hahaha. What’d they say? That always makes me nervous haha. Getting the approval of the friends 😂
25/5/20 23:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:07 - Lorena: Les hablé de vos y mostré un vídeo 🙈 lo siento, jaja pero me estaban preguntando... Al parecer tenía cara emocionada al hablar d vos
25/5/20 23:08 - Lorena: Mis amigas, son super normales... No son como tontas y superficiales ( no sé si esta es la mejor descripción)
25/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: Pero al contarles la historia, ellas estaban diciendo, loreee, nos encanta este chico para vos!! Es genial, va a venir??? 😱Omg
25/5/20 23:09 - Lorena: 🤷🤷🤷
25/5/20 23:11 - Joe: Hahaha wow ok cool. I was nervous. Didn’t expect such a reaction. I’m glad you have an excited face when talking about me haha.
25/5/20 23:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:13 - Joe: I don’t know what to say but I’m stoked that they approve haha. I’m sure you value their opinion so I’m really happy about how they reacted. 

What video did you show them though 🙈
25/5/20 23:14 - Lorena: Jajaja nunca sabes que decir Joe
25/5/20 23:15 - Joe: Haha shit. Sorry 🤷‍♂️
25/5/20 23:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:15 - Lorena: Pero entiendo que si te alegras es porque te gusta
25/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: Jajaja si para mí la opinión de mis amigas es súper importante, mis amigas siempre escuchan que hablo de chicos pero está vez les gustó demasiado la historia y mi cara y quieren que vengas jajaja
25/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: ellas serían unas fieles seguidores de nuestro canal de Youtube jajajaja
25/5/20 23:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:20 - Joe: Hell yeah we already have loyal subscribers and we haven’t even made our first video 😂 😂
25/5/20 23:22 - Joe: Yeah my friends were happy for me but not so happy when I said that going to Spain might be an option for me now haha. They don’t want me to leave them.
25/5/20 23:26 - Joe: I’m so interested to know what you told your friends about me. 

I told my friends that I’m talking to you and that I really want to meet you, but not much else. They don’t ask many questions though so that’s part of it
25/5/20 23:27 - Lorena: Jajaja mis amigas no necesitan hacer demasiadas preguntas
25/5/20 23:27 - Lorena: Me conocen y saben
25/5/20 23:28 - Lorena: Solo hablamos varias cosas y ellas dijeron pero y qué vas a hacer? Y dije creo que el puede venir y ahí ya se volvieron locas
25/5/20 23:30 - Joe: Hahah niiiice. Yeah I’m definitely trying to come out there. I tried to start my passport shit the other day but I need to do it in person with certain paperwork that I don’t have with me here.
25/5/20 23:31 - Joe: I’d probably tell a few of my really close friends more details if I was having a one on one type of conversation but it gets weird telling all of my friends at once in a group chat 😂
25/5/20 23:31 - Lorena: Vieron algo d tus vídeos y dijeron: hacéis muy buena pareja, es sexy, tiene cara de buena gente y nos gusta , no dudes de nada
25/5/20 23:32 - Lorena: 😂😂😂😂
25/5/20 23:32 - Lorena: 🙈 no puedo estar callada, siempre.tengo que contar todo jajajaa o casi todo
25/5/20 23:33 - Joe: Hahaha the more you tell me the more I like it
25/5/20 23:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:38 - Lorena: Jaja solo cosas buenas no dijeron nada en absoluto malo
25/5/20 23:39 - Lorena: Espero que tus amigos no me odien demasiado si finalmente salís d Estados Unidos
25/5/20 23:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
25/5/20 23:42 - Joe: As long as I tell them they can come visit me wherever I go I think they’ll be ok hahah. They say it in a joking way. They’re happy for me and if we were happy, they’d be stoked on you
25/5/20 23:43 - Joe: Hahaha the ultimate pocket. At first I was like 😳 hahahaha
26/5/20 0:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:25 - Lorena: Esos son los amigos que merecen la pena!!!jjj
26/5/20 0:30 - Lorena: Jajajajaja si es que compramos en el pueblo y al llegar a Madrid como hay tanta policía..
26/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: Jaja me hubiese gustado ver tu cara, que hará esta loca?
26/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: 😲😲😲
26/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: Cuánto tiempo pasó?
26/5/20 0:33 - Joe: They’re the best
26/5/20 0:34 - Joe: Haha it’s a good way to sneak it. I don’t have that pocket unfortunately 😂 

It reminds me of these skate shoes from hella long ago that used to have a little pocket in the shoe. Only big enough for stuff like bags of weed haha
26/5/20 0:35 - Joe: Mmmm like 3 weeks. I shared some with the family hahah but yeah it went fast
26/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:41 - Joe: Hahahahaha 😂
26/5/20 0:41 - Joe: Shit
26/5/20 0:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Jajajaja maldito
26/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: hiciste algún truco hoy o algo? 👀
26/5/20 0:47 - Lorena: Hiciste la clase de español con Nelly? 👂
26/5/20 0:49 - Joe: Haha I skated sooo far down the street cause I was trying to land specific tricks before turning around. Took forever but I did what I wanted. It was just for practice, I didn’t film anything
26/5/20 0:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 0:52 - Joe: Hahaha fuck I hate listening to myself 🙉 I need some more practice
26/5/20 1:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:01 - Lorena: Algunas palabras ( con a)
26/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: El resto de palabras, perfectas, te entiendo
26/5/20 1:02 - Lorena: A ver el abecedario 👂 lo voy a escuchar otra vez
26/5/20 1:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:02 - Joe: Fuck I hate that one too
26/5/20 1:03 - Joe: Say it to me
26/5/20 1:03 - Joe: Porfiii hahah
26/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:04 - Joe: Is that how G sounds?
26/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Peeeefecto!!
26/5/20 1:05 - Joe: Ok cool. Now if I could just say it with some confidence
26/5/20 1:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:06 - Joe: Ok ok hold on I’m going to try the phrase about the words one more time.
26/5/20 1:06 - Joe: With confidence haha
26/5/20 1:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:07 - Lorena: Geranios ( planta)!
26/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Gerardo ( nombre de hombre)
26/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: "Muy bien ese audio, lo decís rápido y se entiende perfectamente"
26/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: Jajajaja
26/5/20 1:09 - Joe: Sweeeeeet
26/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: Geranios
26/5/20 1:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: "Yo estuve patinando hoy bastante, no grabé nada, solo estuve practicando varios trucos"
26/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: 🤗
26/5/20 1:12 - Joe: Hahah that’s a longer one. But I got it hold on
26/5/20 1:13 - Lorena: 💪🛹
26/5/20 1:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:15 - Joe: Fuck. Close
26/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:17 - Joe: Hahaha at least I can feel the improvement. Definitely better than this time last month!
26/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 1:18 - Joe: Hahahaha gracias 😊
26/5/20 1:19 - Joe: I’m working on saying things with a little more confidence. When I started trying to say things, everything sounded like a question because of the unsure tone of my voice haha
26/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Claaaaro, hay mejoras, realmente y estás más seguro al hablar!
26/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Esa frase larga al principio no la hubieses dicho
26/5/20 1:25 - Joe: For sure. I would have been too nervous or would’ve stumbled too much to make it through confidently.
26/5/20 1:26 - Joe: It’s cool, the little improvements keep me motivated to learn more.
26/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: Claro que sí, seguiré ayudándote con frases y nuevas palabras
26/5/20 1:28 - Lorena: Me voy a ir a dormiiir, casi 3 meses sin estar tanto tiempo fuera d casa jajaja di un paseo largo a mis perras, luego tomé cerveza y fumé con mis amigas y ahora dormiré como un bebé, te dejo un lugar por si te querés pasar esta noche 🤫
26/5/20 1:30 - Joe: Hahaha mmm I wish I could be there with you. 

Ok sleep well. Talk to you later. Thanks for all the help. I appreciate it. Buenas noches 😘
26/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: Buena tarde para vos rulitos! Muak 😘
26/5/20 9:43 - Joe: I wrote some code to find the words you’ve used the most since I started talking to you. I’m going to use it to help me study relevant words. I hope you don’t think this is weird, I figured it’d help me study 😂
26/5/20 9:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:05 - Lorena: 😱😱😱
26/5/20 10:09 - Lorena: Es raro pero no negativo, no me hubiese imaginado esto con vi el vídeo jaja
26/5/20 10:09 - Joe: I’ll send a copy of the file later. You can see what words you say a lot.
26/5/20 10:09 - Lorena: Me parece útil y romántico!!! Jajaja
26/5/20 10:11 - Joe: Hahaha thanks. I was worried you would just think it’s weird 😂 I figured if I’m going to learn a lot of words, they might as well be the ones you use all the time
26/5/20 10:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:12 - Lorena: chico listo!
26/5/20 10:13 - Lorena: Me encanta
26/5/20 10:15 - Joe: Hahah I’m glad you like it. Yeah there are some funny ones in the list 😂 I haven’t gone through it all the way yet. I pretty much just finished the code when I sent it to you.
26/5/20 10:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:21 - Joe: Hahah I downloaded the chat and then I wrote some code to organize it and count the number of times words show up
26/5/20 10:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:21 - Joe: In the video you can see how to download a WhatsApp chat
26/5/20 10:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:22 - Joe: Super easy
26/5/20 10:22 - Joe: Haha
26/5/20 10:23 - Lorena: Jjjj
26/5/20 10:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:25 - Joe: To get the chat? With a QR code?
26/5/20 10:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:25 - Lorena: Si exacto
26/5/20 10:26 - Joe: iPhone has a screen record button haha
26/5/20 10:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:27 - Joe: Oh shit ok I didn’t know that. I only have it on my phone so it was easier this way for me anyway. It just gets emailed to you when you export it from the app
26/5/20 10:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:27 - Joe: Hahahahaha
26/5/20 10:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:33 - Joe: Hahaha you’re having fun sending me audio.
26/5/20 10:35 - Joe: I’ve heard of those Xiaomi phone. They look cool. All my friends have iPhones though so sharing things is easier, especially video, when we all have iPhones.
26/5/20 10:35 - Lorena: Los pijos skater de Apple
26/5/20 10:35 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/5/20 10:36 - Joe: Haha iPhones are the best for making skateboard edits with 😂
26/5/20 10:36 - Lorena: Jajaj okey okey
26/5/20 10:37 - Lorena: Si puede ser
26/5/20 10:37 - Lorena: Pero a mí me desesperaba la memoria, nunca era suficiente
26/5/20 10:38 - Lorena: En teléfono la verdad es que ya no lo echo de menos, este Xiaomi va perfecto. Mucha gente se pasó de Apple a Xiaomi
26/5/20 10:38 - Lorena: Y era difícil...
26/5/20 10:40 - Joe: Maybe I’ll try one eventually. I need to make this phone last though haha
26/5/20 10:40 - Lorena: Mierda no puedo explicarme
26/5/20 10:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:41 - Joe: About the phone?
26/5/20 10:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:49 - Joe: Haha ok I had to listen to this hella times 😂 but I got it now hahah fuck I need to learn more. 

Anyway, yeah macs have great design and look great but it’s definitely annoying when you need a program that only works on windows. I had a Mac and did a similar thing with the partition
26/5/20 10:50 - Joe: I ended up getting a windows laptop too. I do want that new 16” MacBook Pro though hahaha
26/5/20 10:50 - Joe: Hahahahah
26/5/20 10:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:50 - Joe: I just listened to the other audios 😂 😂 😂
26/5/20 10:52 - Joe: I still couldn’t respond in Spanish and it took too many times to get it....but it’s something hahaha
26/5/20 10:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 10:55 - Lorena: Jajajaja
26/5/20 11:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:01 - Joe: Hahahah shit
26/5/20 11:02 - Lorena: Jajajaja
26/5/20 11:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:02 - Lorena: Tengo que preparar café y tortitas( sería para vos)
26/5/20 11:03 - Lorena: Tengo que prepararte café y tortitas( sería de vos a mí)
26/5/20 11:03 - Lorena: Pero sería mejor decir, "voy a prepararte café y tortitas" ( presente)
26/5/20 11:04 - Lorena: "te prepararé café y tortitas" ( futuro)
26/5/20 11:04 - Lorena: Voy está entre la lista de palabras jjj
26/5/20 11:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:08 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
26/5/20 11:08 - Lorena: Perfectas todas las pronunciaciones ( excepto prepararé)
26/5/20 11:09 - Joe: I was struggling with that one hahah I had to move on
26/5/20 11:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:13 - Lorena: Muy biennn
26/5/20 11:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:13 - Lorena: Y ahora con preparar
26/5/20 11:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:14 - Joe: I need to practice preparar. Too many “r”s is throwing me off haha
26/5/20 11:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:19 - Joe: Dammit how do I get my r on point so no one can tell? Haha I’m not trying to be super obvious. Alright I need to practice R words
26/5/20 11:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:19 - Joe: I’ll just practice ronronear until I got the r sound down 😂
26/5/20 11:21 - Lorena: Mmm jajaja no sé, supongo que escuchando español mucho mucho. Es práctica. Pero ese acento te queda bien jaja así que no te preocupes
26/5/20 11:21 - Joe: Hahah you’re the best
26/5/20 11:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 11:23 - Lorena: Peeeeerfecto hoone
26/5/20 11:23 - Joe: Yeah I guess as long as people can understand me that’s what matters most. But I would definitely feel more confident when I speak if I knew it sounded “right”
26/5/20 11:24 - Lorena: Jaja pero eso es muy difícil, todos tenemos un acento....
26/5/20 11:25 - Lorena: Incluso yo hablo español, pero mi acento es diferente y por más que intenté pronunciar sin el ruido de las letras ll, como "sh" , se nota también ... Podría hacerlo pero tampoco quiero
26/5/20 11:25 - Joe: Haha i just like getting it right 😂 I’m not satisfied when I can tell it’s off.
26/5/20 11:26 - Joe: But you’re right. Everyone has a different accent. Trying to at least get close though haha
26/5/20 11:26 - Lorena: Pero estaba biennn jaja
26/5/20 11:27 - Joe: Yeah I guess I see what you’re saying cause I like the way you sound haha
26/5/20 11:27 - Lorena: Es nuestra fonética. Todos tenemos algo diferente por ejemplo al escuchar a un italiano, francés, español, cualquiera de los tres hablando inglés te darías cuenta de dónde son
26/5/20 11:27 - Lorena: O incluso árabes hablando inglés
26/5/20 11:30 - Joe: That’s true haha alright I won’t put too much thought into the accent. If you hear something that’s waaaay off I need you to say something though haha
26/5/20 11:41 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/5/20 11:41 - Lorena: Claro los acentos son bonitos, habrá palabras que suenen más parecidas a nuestro acento español que otras, es práctica
26/5/20 11:41 - Lorena: De todos modos mira qué bien te sale la pronunciación del acento uruguayo
26/5/20 11:42 - Lorena: Parece que llevas practicandola más tiempo que la de España
26/5/20 11:47 - Joe: Haha yeah I’m not sure why that accent comes more naturally. As long as it sounds good to you that’s all that matters 🤷‍♂️
26/5/20 11:47 - Joe: I don’t really need to impress anyone with my spanish haha

26/5/20 20:35 - Joe: I need to learn more word of “affection” in spanish haha. I hella like it when you use them 😂
26/5/20 20:38 - Lorena: si, lo ví.. no te dio tiempo ni a ver el gif jajaja
26/5/20 20:38 - Lorena: jajaja, son las mismas pero en femenino. Pero vos tenés que decírmelas en inglés
26/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: mmm, creo que nunca me dijiste ninguna jajaja, estoy pesando
26/5/20 20:40 - Joe: Hahaha I always think about it but I never say anything like that.
26/5/20 20:41 - Joe: Hahaha shit
26/5/20 20:41 - Joe: Am I supposed to say something now???
26/5/20 20:41 - Joe: I’m going to wait so it’s more of a surprise haha

26/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: a tu ritmo!
26/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: mirá, hoy mientras escuchaba música preparé esto para vos
26/5/20 20:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 20:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 20:44 - Joe: Siiiiick. Does this mean I need Spotify now? Haha
26/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: mierdaaa
26/5/20 20:45 - Lorena: jaja, es verdad.. bueno no pasa nada, pueso pasarte captura de pantalla y la buscas en apple
26/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: es que hay veces que te quiero pasar música y me olvido, y así te iba sumando canciones
26/5/20 20:46 - Joe: Hahah I’ll download Spotify. No big deal
26/5/20 20:47 - Joe: It’ll be faster than looking for the songs and that way you can keep adding to the playlist and I’ll see the songs
26/5/20 20:47 - Joe: Joe Rogan just signed with Spotify and I always listen to his podcast so I’m going to download it eventually anyways haha
26/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: jaja mierda, hago que te descargues whatsapp... spotify.. jaja
26/5/20 20:51 - Joe: Haha it’s all good! If it makes it easier to send stuff to each other, I’m happy to download
26/5/20 20:52 - Lorena: 💙
26/5/20 20:52 - Lorena: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ucnZTDMcRhirltfqsSESW?si=5Hav3M2JReS33tBtS3fpQw
26/5/20 20:54 - Lorena: El estilo de música, no sé si te gustará o te parecerá raro.. pero son buenos músicos jjj
26/5/20 20:54 - Joe: Hell yeah. Got it. Now you can just add songs to that playlist and I’ll hear them when they come up. Thank you thank you!
26/5/20 20:54 - Lorena: de hecho, cuando escuché las canciones hoy, iba pensando si entenderías y creo que hay palabras que si, te puede venir bien jaja
26/5/20 20:55 - Joe: I like a pretty wide range of music haha. As long as it fits the mood for the day I enjoy it
26/5/20 20:55 - Lorena: el significado de las letras, te gustaría en algunas, sobre todo de los delincuentes, que son super humildes, les encanta fumar marihuana, la naturaleza,son simples jaja
26/5/20 20:55 - Joe: I’ve really been liking the music you’ve sent so far too. Just send whatever you like. Anything you like to listen to. Don’t worry if I’ll like it or not, it’s more important that you like it.
26/5/20 20:57 - Joe: Los delincuentes also like singing about crumbs and mustaches hahaha I like their stuff for sure
26/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: si, a mi me gusta todo este tipo de música... luego hay m
26/5/20 21:01 - Lorena: música, estilo regueton/ reggaeton no sé si conoces.. pero es como música que se baila en las discotecas, un poco latina, y machista 😷 ..
26/5/20 21:01 - Lorena: ijajaa sii, buena memoria!
26/5/20 21:02 - Lorena: en tus 1.000 palabras salió lorenzo
26/5/20 21:03 - Joe: Haha do you want to see the list? I can send it to you
26/5/20 21:04 - Lorena: claro, pasamela
26/5/20 21:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:08 - Joe: Hmm I’m not sure I understand this correctly. The music you like is played in the nightclubs? Or no?
26/5/20 21:09 - Lorena: nooooo
26/5/20 21:09 - Lorena: al contrario jaja
26/5/20 21:09 - Joe: Ok for sure that makes more sense haha. That’s why I was kind of confused
26/5/20 21:10 - Lorena: que hay un gran estilo de música en español, que se llama regueton, que seguramente si conoces a alguien que hable español, es posible que te pase ese tipo de música
26/5/20 21:10 - Joe: Damn maybe I should make the same kind of list with the words I use. I wonder what words I use a lot 🤔
26/5/20 21:12 - Joe: Yeah I’ve heard of that style of music but I don’t hear it played often
26/5/20 21:12 - Lorena: la música que yo te paso no suena en las discotecas, es más como de festival, más "hippie" por decirlo así, pero sin significado de hippie.. jaja acá cuando decís hippie, es como más informal.. mierda no sé como definirlo
26/5/20 21:13 - Lorena: sii, hacelo porfi, y me lo pasas así aprendo yo también!
26/5/20 21:15 - Joe: Haha I think I get it. Hippie isn’t the most positive term around here haha. But I know what you mean when you say it
26/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: la palabra exacta en español, sería campechano. No sé como explicarlo
26/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: mierdaaaa
26/5/20 21:15 - Lorena: jajaja
26/5/20 21:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:17 - Joe: Languages are so weird. I’ve been thinking lately about how imprecise they are sometimes. Words are like an abstraction of feelings so sometimes it’s hard to describe a word, especially with a language barrier 😂
26/5/20 21:17 - Lorena: exactoooooo
26/5/20 21:17 - Lorena: jajaja me siento impotente en no poder explicarte este significado
26/5/20 21:17 - Joe: Haha alright. Should be pretty easy. I’ll send it to you later
26/5/20 21:19 - Lorena: en realidad supongo que como ahi, la gente tiene un estilo, aunque no este 100% definido... lleva un tipo de ropa, escucha un tipo de música,etc
26/5/20 21:19 - Joe: Hahaha I know the feeling. 

Damn....now I’m becoming really interested in the concept of languages 😂
26/5/20 21:20 - Lorena: jajaja
26/5/20 21:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:20 - Lorena: y al final, el tipo de música e una persona, puede definir un poco su "cultura y personalidad", hasta acá me estas entendiendo?
26/5/20 21:21 - Lorena: PUEDE... jaja es un pensamiento mio
26/5/20 21:23 - Joe: Hahah so far I get it. But I still think you’ll have to show me these people. Although, I feel like I’d recognize them if I saw them. They sound like my kind of people hahah
26/5/20 21:24 - Lorena: jajaja si, puede serrr, pero no estoy segura! mmm tampoco escuché casi tu música, aunque se que te gusta de todo
26/5/20 21:24 - Lorena: campechano1, campechana

"expresión campechana; aspecto campechano"
26/5/20 21:24 - Lorena: definición de Google jaja
26/5/20 21:27 - Lorena: la gente que escucha este tipo de música que te pasé como los delincuentes, se viste informal, como ellos, o como más alternativa...los chicos suelen llevar pelo largo y pendiente de aros de plata.. jaja, tatuajes, les gusta la naturaleza más que las ciudades, la cerveza más que un gintonic jajaja, la marihuana, la vida simple, pensamientos igualitarios en cuanto a hombres y mujeres, lo cotidiano, sin lujos...
26/5/20 21:28 - Lorena: estoy generalizando para que puedas entenderlo, nunca tuve que explicar que es campechano o una persona que escucha los delincuentes ajjaja
26/5/20 21:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:29 - Joe: Mmm I liiiike it hahah
26/5/20 21:30 - Joe: You did a great job explaining hahah. Not sure if I fit in with their music selection or the earrings but the rest describes me well 😆
26/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: yo creo que encajas, por eso me gustas, jajaja pero en extranjero
26/5/20 21:31 - Joe: I like their music, but I’m not sure they’d like the random shit I listen to sometimes haha. I’m like a jukebox with every genre in it and it’s set to play random music
26/5/20 21:32 - Lorena: mmmm jaja
26/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: a estas alturas me puede dar miedo si me decis que te gusta Miley Cirus o Beyonce.. jaja
26/5/20 21:33 - Lorena: Cyrus*
26/5/20 21:33 - Joe: You can feel my campechano vibes from afar 😂
26/5/20 21:34 - Joe: Hahahaha neither of those thankfully 😂 😂
26/5/20 21:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:36 - Lorena: jajaja siii
26/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: menos mal Joe, jaja me da un poco de miedo lo de aleatorio ajajaja,  asi que vamos, deberías hacer una playlist y subirme musica, si hay algo que no me gusta tengo que aceptarlo, cuanto más rápido mejor!
26/5/20 21:39 - Joe: Hahaha I mean I can do that. It would just be all over the place. Some stuff you’ll like, like the things I sent you already, and some stuff you’ll hate 🤷‍♂️ 

I’m weird about music. Sometimes I’ll like a song because I heard it at a certain time, even if I usually wouldn’t like it. Same with when I like a song from a skate video I wouldn’t normally listen to.
26/5/20 21:40 - Joe: It’s about the feeling or memory the song gives me more than the actual song itself sometimes
26/5/20 21:43 - Lorena: jajaja suena lógico
26/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: si, en realidad a mi también me pasa, cuando fui a Uruguay algunas amigas y amigos, hicieron que escuche musica que en mi casa no hubiese escuchado, jaja y al final me trae recuerdos buenos y la incluyo en mis listas
26/5/20 21:47 - Joe: Haha now just imagine if instead of getting songs from people in Uruguay, you got songs from the people in the Bay Area that say, “this shit slaps” 😂 😂
26/5/20 21:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 21:51 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:05 - Lorena: Jajaja síii porfi
26/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: Jajaj los de bahía son como los de las películas
26/5/20 22:06 - Lorena: Yo quiero escuchar esa música tuya que te gusta de bahía
26/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: 👂👂👂
26/5/20 22:09 - Joe: Hahaha nooo you don’t. But I’ll make a separate Bay Area playlist for you 😂 

I’m not really into Bay Area music anymore so don’t judge too harshly based on those songs haha but I did like it when I was younger 😂
26/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: Jajaja quiero una de música que te guste d joven y adulto no importa!!!
26/5/20 22:10 - Lorena: Me gustará todo segurooo
26/5/20 22:11 - Joe: Alright I’ll make some Spotify playlist. There will be stuff you like and stuff you hate I’m sure. Most of the songs on my current playlist are island style and the stuff you sent me but I’m going to send you stuff I used to listen to also.
26/5/20 22:11 - Lorena: Perfecto quiero escucharlo
26/5/20 22:11 - Joe: 😂 nooooo you won’t. I guarantee you won’t like everything.
26/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: No creo que lo odie
26/5/20 22:12 - Joe: I’m putting it together on Spotify for you now
26/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: Yo tengo en mi lista la canción isleña que me pasaste
26/5/20 22:12 - Lorena: Jajajaa y la escucho a menudo pq me recuerda a vos
26/5/20 22:13 - Lorena: Si la hubiese encontrado en Youtube la hubiese escuchado solo una vez quizá jaja pero que sepas que está dentro de mi lista de siempre así que sale cada vez que la escucho completa
26/5/20 22:14 - Lorena: 🤩
26/5/20 22:21 - Joe: Hahah this shit is going to make you hate me 😂
26/5/20 22:22 - Lorena: Ya es tarde para que pueda odiarte
26/5/20 22:22 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/5/20 22:22 - Joe: Hahaha trapped
26/5/20 22:22 - Lorena: No podría ... Pero si querés te lo confirmo cuando lo escuche jajaja
26/5/20 22:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:23 - Joe: Hahah ok ok I started it with stuff I know you’d like before just going to the random shit

26/5/20 22:24 - Joe: I’ll make a separate one for the Bay Area slappers 😂
26/5/20 22:24 - Lorena: Cobarde!!!!
26/5/20 22:24 - Lorena: Jajaj
26/5/20 22:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

26/5/20 22:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:30 - Joe: I was in the music video for this song hahahah. I remembered when making the bay list https://open.spotify.com/track/53xMzLfoeWggyqZZ1DSXq6?si=T47ojk74QEmaksbUHpTRaw
26/5/20 22:30 - Joe: Hahaha aaah I’m serious 😂
26/5/20 22:30 - Joe: I didn’t add those last 3. Last song was the Kendrick Lamar song hahaha shiiiiiiit
26/5/20 22:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:33 - Joe: Hahaha whyyyyyyy
26/5/20 22:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:35 - Joe: Hahaha dude I told you my songs are all over the place. I usually only listen to music while I’m coding or skating, with headphones, so you don’t have to worry about what I’m listening to 😂 😂 I wouldn’t torture you like that
26/5/20 22:36 - Joe: You’re going to hate this playlist but 🤷‍♂️ https://open.spotify.com/user/317lkjvlkv6w4riezrjqvfx5abji/playlist/2glwm6nfOv0AGqP6XjCywV?si=3zXs85S_TbG7MhLO_9Qgpw
26/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: Esas tres últimas no me.gustaron
26/5/20 22:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:37 - Joe: Hahah I can’t tell if you’re joking because I really didn’t put those
26/5/20 22:37 - Joe: 😞
26/5/20 22:37 - Lorena: Blink 182 me recuerda a mí adolescencia, así que no serás juzgado tampoco ...
26/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: La vie en rose me sorprendió que la hayas puesto, me gusta mucho esa canción antigua
26/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: Por culpa de ellos quizá pierdo al chico que me gusta jajjaja
26/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: Es broma
26/5/20 22:40 - Lorena: Casi pierdo*
26/5/20 22:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:40 - Joe: Hahaha shiiiit
26/5/20 22:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: Esa canción de humble dice perra siéntate? Jajaja seguro estoy escuchando mal
26/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: Ay menos maaaal, jaja mi cara cunado vi Ricky Martín casi me desmayo
26/5/20 22:42 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/5/20 22:43 - Joe: Hahahah you’re probably hearing it right 😬 

I don’t really think he’s referring to women though. Just anyone that’s a bitch haha
26/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: 🤔
26/5/20 22:44 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t like Ricky Martin! Spotify is trying to make me look bad
26/5/20 22:47 - Joe: It’s hard to contextualize haha I understand your reservations on that song. Not the greatest haha but i like the artist sometimes.
26/5/20 22:49 - Joe: He has an interesting story growing up in Compton California and a lot of his songs tell a story about growing up there. I should’ve picked a better example of his music haha but it was one of the first ones to pop up
26/5/20 22:49 - Lorena: No la escuché entera, solo esa parte
26/5/20 22:50 - Lorena: Pfff hubiese sido duro si era verdad . Así que me alegro mucho que la culpa sea de  Spotify jajaja
26/5/20 22:51 - Lorena: Escucharé más de él no te preocupes
26/5/20 22:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:52 - Lorena: 😭
26/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: En mi playlist saldrá algo que yo no elegí? Mmm
26/5/20 22:53 - Joe: Hahah what is happening? I’m not adding anything haha
26/5/20 22:53 - Lorena: Yo no quería ver esas canciones y le di a "menos"
26/5/20 22:53 - Joe: You’ll have to report a bug to Spotify haha
26/5/20 22:54 - Lorena: Y vuelve a añadir otras canciones
26/5/20 22:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Perfecto
26/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Jaja nada raro
26/5/20 22:55 - Joe: Hmmm
26/5/20 22:55 - Joe: Ok I’ll add another song
26/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: Kendrick Lamar suena bien
26/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: Jaja ese te hace recordar a vídeos de skate verdad? Jajaja
26/5/20 22:57 - Lorena: Las 4 primeras d la lista me gustan
26/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Haha little bit. I added another one. That song reeaaaally reminds me of skate videos
26/5/20 23:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Mmm igual me estoy equivocando jaja
26/5/20 23:01 - Lorena: Voy a escucharla completa
26/5/20 23:02 - Lorena: No me deja escucharla completa desde el móvil
26/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: Me gusta esta playlist también jaja 🙊
26/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: This shit hella slapsss
26/5/20 23:03 - Joe: Hahaha siiiiick I didn’t think you’d like it 😂
26/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: Yo también soy aleatoria
26/5/20 23:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:36 - Lorena: Lo de al lado es el número de veces?
26/5/20 23:41 - Joe: Exactooo
26/5/20 23:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:41 - Joe: Hahahah!
26/5/20 23:42 - Joe: That’s a lot 😬
26/5/20 23:42 - Joe: Top 100 haha
26/5/20 23:42 - Joe: Haha and “shit” up at #65
26/5/20 23:44 - Joe: I only gave the top 1000. I think you had about 3200 words total though. I didn’t check my total
26/5/20 23:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/5/20 23:44 - Lorena: Mmm aunque yo digo muchas veces.. o mieeeeerda ... Hay veces que con más "e" o menos
26/5/20 23:45 - Lorena: Jajaja pocas me parecen
26/5/20 23:45 - Lorena: 3200 desde que llegamos hablando?
26/5/20 23:45 - Lorena: Y vos?
26/5/20 23:46 - Lorena: No puede ser... 3200 son pocas
26/5/20 23:46 - Lorena: Llevamos casi dos meses hablando
26/5/20 23:47 - Lorena: Que vos*
26/5/20 23:47 - Joe: Haha I told you 80% of spoken Spanish is 1000 words so 3200 is not unreasonable in my opinion.
26/5/20 23:48 - Lorena: Jajaja Joe y sus artículos basados en cifras de a saber dónde jajaja
26/5/20 23:49 - Lorena: Cuántas palabras vos total?
26/5/20 23:49 - Joe: Haha just trying to be efficient here. I’ll check my total now. One second
26/5/20 23:51 - Joe: Oh and yeah having the same word spelled differently or a different conjugation of the same word will be two different words on the list
26/5/20 23:51 - Joe: I’ve only used 2335 words according to this haha
26/5/20 23:52 - Joe: Interesting data. Maybe I’ll update it again in a month or so. We can see how the words move around over time
26/5/20 23:54 - Lorena: Interesantee!!!
26/5/20 23:54 - Joe: Hahah I should make a website for us that shows some visualizations for word use over time 🤔 

Seems like it’d be cool. 

It’s pretty crazy how few words it takes to communicate for a month, talking about so many different things.
26/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: Jajaja me gustan esas ideas jajaja
26/5/20 23:57 - Lorena: Las mismas palabras
26/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: You 770
26/5/20 23:58 - Lorena: Vos 88
26/5/20 23:59 - Joe: Hahaha oh nooo you’re going through the data more than me 😂 you’re going to have too much fun with that knowledge
26/5/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajaja si estoy comparando
26/5/20 23:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Pero necesito verlo en el mismo Excel
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jajaj
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jajajaja
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Asexual no aparece
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Ni follar, ni cojer, ni fuck (me )
27/5/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jajajajaj
27/5/20 0:00 - Joe: 😂
27/5/20 0:01 - Joe: going to have to use those more if you want them on the list haha 🤷‍♂️
27/5/20 0:02 - Lorena: Jajaja no me provoques
27/5/20 0:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/5/20 0:03 - Lorena: Jajajajajaja
27/5/20 0:07 - Lorena: Pero 171
27/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: But 294
27/5/20 0:10 - Joe: You’re much more diverse in your word selection haha almost 1000 more words than I’ve used so far. I have hellllaaaa words to learn haha
27/5/20 0:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/5/20 0:11 - Joe: Hahaha I want to shower you in complements but sometimes I’m worried you’ll think it’s corny.
27/5/20 0:12 - Joe: And words of affection too. I guess that feeling is a part of being shy. I’ll do better haha just don’t judge me too much if I say something corny
27/5/20 0:16 - Lorena: Mmm no lo pienses tanto, si lo sentís, decilo
27/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Hahah yeah that makes sense. I’ll do that
27/5/20 0:19 - Lorena: Yo no lo pienso, te lo digo ... Y sé que en algunas cosas soy cursi (pero sé que no lo soy con todos, así que tengo que aprovechar) y quiero que lo sepas, te podés reír de mí cuando te diga cosas jjj
27/5/20 0:23 - Joe: I think it’s sweet when you say corny things haha. Especially cause I know you aren’t super into that kind of stuff, I appreciate that you can be that way with me occasionally. And you never overdue it so it always seems genuinely nice
27/5/20 0:33 - Lorena: 🤗 gracias!!!
27/5/20 0:33 - Lorena: Por curiosidad, que palabras de esas te gusta más que te diga?
27/5/20 0:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/5/20 0:38 - Joe: 🤔 I don’t know. Hard to come up with a longer phrase off the top of my head but when you throw in a lindo, bombón, ruilitos(?) or something like that I think it’s hella cute
27/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: Jajaja los osos
27/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: A que tienda vas tanto?
27/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Jaja sí esas son las que te digo siempre, y pinocho jajaja
27/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Well this time is Costco but sometimes it’s a different store haha.
27/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: Rulitos si jjj
27/5/20 0:40 - Lorena: Pero de qué son esas tiendas?
27/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Haha yeah and pinocho. I love all that stuff 😂
27/5/20 0:42 - Joe: Ooh haha supermarkets usually. Like grocery store. 

But Costco is a biiig warehouse style store. They have everything. Groceries, electronics, clothes, appliances, you can even buy a car or a vacation from Costco 😂
27/5/20 0:42 - Lorena: Jaja cursii, bueno espero que se te vaya la vergüenza para decir algunas que ya es hora jaja, además así aprendo inglés con esas palabras también jaja
27/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Ahh es un mayorista! Jjj espero que compres buenas cosas!
27/5/20 0:46 - Joe: I’m just getting groceries haha. My sister asked me to go.
27/5/20 0:49 - Joe: Words of affection in English sound way more corny to me than Spanish words haha. The only one I use is babe or baby 😂
27/5/20 0:51 - Joe: Sweetie, beautiful, cutie seem like not the words I want to use. It’s like I want to use their meaning but the exact word just doesn’t feel right haha
27/5/20 0:57 - Joe: Ok I’m about to go in this Costco. I’ll probably be in there for a while. No service in there so I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
27/5/20 1:03 - Lorena: Estas me gustan!! Jaja

27/5/20 23:58 - Joe: Hahaha sounds like you’re having a good time 😂
27/5/20 23:59 - Joe: Skating was great. Not too hot today. I definitely need a new board and shoes when I get back to California though.
27/5/20 23:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:01 - Joe: Hahahaha
28/5/20 0:01 - Joe: Aaaw damn I wish I was with you. Sounds fun 😂
28/5/20 0:07 - Lorena: Jajajaja
28/5/20 0:08 - Lorena: Es un trabalenguas y no podemos decirlo jaja 🍻
28/5/20 0:12 - Joe: Hahah I was wondering what was going on. Tongue twister made you sound extra drunk haha
28/5/20 0:13 - Lorena: Jajajaja
28/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:16 - Joe: Hahahahahaha
28/5/20 0:16 - Joe: Hahahahah
28/5/20 0:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:17 - Lorena: Jajajaja a ver vos
28/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Joe quiero verte
28/5/20 0:20 - Joe: Hwjzjdnwk fuck I wish I could get to you right now 😞
28/5/20 0:22 - Joe: Stop being so far away. I would appreciate that very much haha
28/5/20 0:24 - Lorena: Buah me encantaría estar cerca ahora mismo
28/5/20 0:25 - Lorena: Creo que las cervezas( de calidad del bar) acentúan mis ganas de conocerte
28/5/20 0:26 - Joe: I read in the website to get my passport that there might be delays in getting one because of COVID 😩
28/5/20 0:26 - Joe: Hahah I’m sure that’s the case. I’m ok with that though ahah
28/5/20 0:27 - Lorena: 😭😭😭😭
28/5/20 0:28 - Joe: I’m really trying to figure this out and make it happen as soon as possible. But I know it’ll be a few months at least which really really sucks.
28/5/20 0:29 - Lorena: Te espero lo que sea necesario, auuuunque me gustaría ya
28/5/20 0:30 - Joe: The good news is, the longer it takes, the more time I have to practice my spanish but it’s really not a pleasant feeling not being able to see you sometimes. 

Some days after we talk I want to just end the day by laying close to you soooo bad
28/5/20 0:30 - Lorena: Joe, crees que es posible echar de menos a una persona que no conoces?
28/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: Deberías haber terminado la frase con la palabra "corny" hahaja
28/5/20 0:31 - Joe: Hahaha I’ve literally wanted to ask you the same for the last few days 😂 

I just keep getting this feeling of wanting to tell you I miss you
28/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: Pero me sirve y me gusta que me lo digas!!!
28/5/20 0:31 - Joe: Hahah dammit missed my chance
28/5/20 0:32 - Lorena: En serio? Jajajaja
28/5/20 0:33 - Joe: Yes seriously. But then I just think to myself, “that doesn’t make sense to say, you’ve never met her”..but the feeling is there
28/5/20 0:34 - Lorena: Yo lo siento así, pero sé que no es lo normal decirlo a una persona que no conoces. Pero creo que es el significado lo que sirve, así que si, te echo de menos 😂
28/5/20 0:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:37 - Lorena: " siento si soy cursi, pero las cervezas me hacen verlo con claridad, te echo de menos"
28/5/20 0:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 0:39 - Joe: Hahahaha
28/5/20 0:39 - Joe: aaaaaah distance is hard to deal with
28/5/20 0:39 - Joe: Shit
28/5/20 0:40 - Joe: Why do you have to actually be a cool person and so far away at the same time? This would’ve been a lot easier if you were just boring and uninteresting 😂 

You’re torturing me haha
28/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Jajaja
28/5/20 0:44 - Lorena: Lo mismo te digo, no entiendo por qué tuve que tener feeling con el chico que está más lejos de mi en el puto mundo
28/5/20 0:45 - Lorena: Si viviese en España, aunque estes a unas horas intentaría agarrar un coche e ir a verte
28/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: Pero estás en el otro lado del mundo,como, cooomo es posibel esto?
28/5/20 0:46 - Lorena: Posible*
28/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: Explícame cómo es posible esto o lo que quieras pero en un vídeo
28/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: Porfiii quiero verte
28/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

28/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: Voy a dar vuelta la pantalla
28/5/20 1:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 1:01 - Joe: Haha whoops sorry it’s upside down 😂

28/5/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jajaj necesito unos subtítulos, no soy capaz ahora mismo de entenderlo completo .. solo algunas palabras
28/5/20 1:07 - Joe: Hahahaha hopefully you never understand those videos. Less embarrassing for me 😂
28/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 1:10 - Joe: Hahaha alright
28/5/20 1:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 1:15 - Joe: Could’ve been anybody, and for some reason you messaged me, very randomly, so I blame you for everything haha. I don’t know though. I just find you interesting and ummm we have like, the same outlook on stuff a lot of the time, which is really nice. Mmm there’s so much stuff. I don’t know. There are like 6 billion humans and...I don’t know...you found me on the internet haha. Anyway, I wish I was with you. I miss you. Ok. Byyye
28/5/20 1:20 - Joe: Oh I also forgot to tell you. It’s pretty weird cause when I first came here to Hawaii I said I was going to focus on myself, do my own thing...girls were not supposed to be a part of it. But I don’t know how you pulled me in. You pulled me out of my shell and made me start talking and I couldn’t stop. I still can’t stop. Blah blah blah blah. Anyway, i don’t know what else to say, I’ve got lots of things to say, maybe I’ll write you a letter or something. Ok feel free to send me a video too!
28/5/20 1:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 1:59 - Lorena: Una carta!!  Siiii

28/5/20 14:49 - Lorena: Jajajaja fuck
28/5/20 14:49 - Lorena: 🙈🙊
28/5/20 14:50 - Joe: Hahahaha sounded like you were having a good time. Made me want to be there with you.
28/5/20 14:51 - Joe: I wish I could download just the audio clips haha. So good
28/5/20 14:51 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
28/5/20 14:52 - Lorena: En el primero Sandra intenta decirlo y no puede y me dice, a ver? Como es... Y yo al rato repito igual de mal que ella jajaja
28/5/20 14:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 14:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 14:55 - Lorena: Cuáles son voy a escucharlos jaja
28/5/20 14:56 - Joe: Hahaha those are my favorite audio clips now 😂
28/5/20 14:56 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🙈
28/5/20 14:57 - Lorena: En algún momento vas a tener que repitirlo vos jajaja
28/5/20 14:57 - Lorena: Ese o un trabalenguas en inglés jaja
28/5/20 14:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 14:59 - Joe: Hahahaha I’ll do it faster and louder later 😂
28/5/20 14:59 - Joe: That shits hard
28/5/20 15:00 - Lorena: 😱😲
28/5/20 15:00 - Lorena: Jajajaja muy bieeen boludo
28/5/20 15:00 - Lorena: Fuck no puedo reírme de vos lo hiciste bien jajaja y encima no hablas el idioma
28/5/20 15:00 - Lorena: Mmmm jajaja
28/5/20 15:01 - Joe: Haha it wasn’t so hard since I was reading it while I was saying it.
28/5/20 15:01 - Joe: And I went a little slow
28/5/20 15:02 - Joe: I also messed up in there somewhere haha. If I said it fast and loud without reading it I would probably do horribly 😂 

Good practice though hahah
28/5/20 15:02 - Lorena: Jajaja no no pero biennn
28/5/20 15:02 - Joe: You’ll have to do “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” hahah
28/5/20 15:03 - Lorena: Yo también lo haría igual de mal jajaja
28/5/20 15:03 - Lorena: Jajaja
28/5/20 15:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:04 - Joe: Hahaha niiiiice! I found the whole thing. I’m going to try it haha 
“She sells seashells by the seashore.
The shells she sells are surely seashells.
So if she sells shells on the seashore,
I'm sure she sells seashore shells.”
28/5/20 15:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:05 - Joe: Hahahahah the English one was way harder for me 😂
28/5/20 15:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 15:15 - Joe: A black dude was killed by police a few days ago and now people are really upset. Shits crazy
28/5/20 15:16 - Joe: Anyway, I’m going to try to get a few more hours of sleep! It’s too early haha. Have a good day I’ll talk to you a little later 😘
28/5/20 19:56 - Joe: Duuuude they changed my flight and now it’s going to take 13 hours to get from Hawaii to San Francisco. It usually only takes 5 hours 🤦‍♂️
28/5/20 19:56 - Lorena: Nooooo
28/5/20 20:07 - Lorena: Jajajajaja 🙊
28/5/20 20:08 - Lorena: Jajaja a las 3 de la mañana haciendo un trabalenguas jajajaja
28/5/20 20:10 - Lorena: Que difícil es ese trabalenguas jajaja sh sh sh
28/5/20 20:11 - Lorena: No puede ser, parece de película!!!
28/5/20 20:11 - Joe: The spanish one was way easier for me
28/5/20 20:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 20:12 - Lorena: Pero estás seguro que re corona? Acá cuando todo empezó círculó un vídeo que era de black Friday de América jaja, no de corona
28/5/20 20:13 - Joe: It’s all from this guy getting killed by the police 🚔
28/5/20 20:13 - Lorena: Esta loca!dios
28/5/20 20:13 - Joe: George Floyd
28/5/20 20:14 - Joe: Yeah some insane stuff happening right now. Los Angeles had some protest on the freeway yesterday too.
28/5/20 20:15 - Lorena: Ah mataron a un chico negro?
28/5/20 20:16 - Lorena: Cuántos casos de estos hay, que asco de policía!!!!! Como abusa del poder y siempre con los pobres negros, no sé cómo esto sigue pasando a día de hoy, de verdad, me pone enferma
28/5/20 20:17 - Lorena: Iba a decir, cuánta violencia en Minneapolis, pero yo haría lo mismo, que injusto
28/5/20 20:19 - Joe: Yeah the video went viral and it shows the officer with his knee on the mans neck for 9+ minutes. The man at the beginning was saying he can’t breathe and by the end was dead. 

Because he was suspected of using a fake $10 bill. He died over a piece of paper
28/5/20 20:20 - Lorena: Hace un tiempo vi un vídeo horrible, un policía mata al perro de un chico negro, solo pq ladraba... me dieron ganas de llorar
28/5/20 20:23 - Lorena: Acabo dw ver el video
28/5/20 20:24 - Lorena: Que impotenciaaaa, que hijos de putaaaa 🤬🤬🤬 putos asesinos, pobre chico dios
28/5/20 20:27 - Joe: Yeah that shit was fucked up
28/5/20 20:28 - Joe: The same shit has been happening for years and nothing ever changes. People are tired of it
28/5/20 20:30 - Lorena: Si boludo, es horrible. Cuánto el color de piel va a dejar de ser importante para esta gente asquerosa
28/5/20 20:30 - Lorena: Lo peor de todo, es que son elegidos para que cuiden y protejan a la gente, y son los que terminan matando..
28/5/20 20:32 - Lorena: *cuando
28/5/20 20:37 - Joe: It’s super messed up. And it really feels like nothing will change. That’s probably how the people that are setting things on fire and destroying stuff feel. Like it’ll never change
28/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: Totalmente..
28/5/20 20:39 - Lorena: Fuiste a alguna manifestación o similar?
28/5/20 20:41 - Lorena: Escucha y que solución te dan para el vuelo???
28/5/20 20:41 - Lorena: No puede ser 12 horas, reclama eso! Vos no lo compraste con esas condiciones
28/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: Se tiene que hacer cargo la compañía
28/5/20 20:42 - Lorena: 13 horas perdón
28/5/20 20:42 - Joe: No. There is nothing happening here for protest or anything. I guess a part of the problem is the country being so big.
28/5/20 20:43 - Joe: There are some protest in California. In Los Angeles but not as big as it should be or as big as it would take to change things
28/5/20 20:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: No puede ser
28/5/20 20:46 - Joe: Depart at 10:20a and arrive at 11:20p
28/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: No lo aceptes
28/5/20 20:46 - Lorena: Acá o te devuelven el dinero o te dejan cambiar de vuelo
28/5/20 20:46 - Joe: I have to haha
28/5/20 20:46 - Joe: It’s my only way back
28/5/20 20:47 - Lorena: Seguro que lo envían por si lo aceptas
28/5/20 20:47 - Lorena: Reclama, decí que querés aunque sea otro día cerca a esa fecha pero con tus condiciones de 5 hs, o tendrán que devolverte una parte de dinero de ese billete inicial
28/5/20 20:49 - Joe: Not many flights going out of Hawaii right now so I can’t really do much about it. In normal times I’d agree with what you’re saying. But for now I just have to suck it up and make the journey.
28/5/20 20:49 - Joe: I’ll be ok. It’ll just be one uncomfortable day
28/5/20 20:49 - Lorena: Pero ni siquiera consultarlo?
28/5/20 20:50 - Joe: I mean, I checked for other flights and there aren’t any going out. This was the one. Unless I want to wait until July
28/5/20 20:50 - Lorena: Ahhh
28/5/20 20:51 - Joe: I’m not really too upset about it hahah. It’s going to be annoying but it’s ok.
28/5/20 20:51 - Lorena: 🤨
28/5/20 20:51 - Joe: Just have to make sure I have lots of movies and shows downloaded and have my computer charged. I’ll keep busy.
28/5/20 20:52 - Joe: I’m easy going 🤷‍♂️ It’s hard to make me really upset about something hahah. It’s not the end of the world
28/5/20 20:54 - Joe: It’d be funny if we were going on a trip together and something like this happened with the tickets. You’d probably be calling and trying to fix it...and I’ll just be saying, “honey it’s fiiiiine, no big deal”
28/5/20 20:55 - Lorena: Jajaja exacto
28/5/20 20:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 20:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 20:58 - Joe: Hahahahaha
28/5/20 20:58 - Joe: 😂
28/5/20 20:59 - Joe: Good news is my sister bought a ticket for the same flight. She is going to surprise my parents when they come to pick me up haha. Should be good
28/5/20 20:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/5/20 20:59 - Joe: 😂
28/5/20 21:00 - Lorena: Siiiii?? Eso sí es buena noticia!!!
28/5/20 21:00 - Joe: I mean it’s not sooo bad. Just watch movies and tv and code like I’m stuck in quarantine.
28/5/20 21:01 - Joe: It’ll be fun to see their reaction haha. She’s just coming for a week since she doesn’t have work right now.
28/5/20 21:01 - Lorena: Jajaj será el único día que no hablemos
28/5/20 21:02 - Lorena: Estoy pensando...creo que nunca pasaron 12hs 😅
28/5/20 21:03 - Lorena: Buena elección, será divertido!!
28/5/20 21:03 - Joe: Flight is at 10:20a so I’ll probably send a few messages before haha
28/5/20 21:13 - Lorena: Jjjj eso espero! 😊
28/5/20 21:20 - Joe: It’ll be the best part of the day for me by far hahaha
28/5/20 21:22 - Joe: You taking a break from the course because of the computer running slow, right? Cause I’m trying to see more of your fancy 3d stuff!
28/5/20 21:28 - Lorena: Jajaj intentaré enviarte mensajes para que se te haga ameno el viaje en las escalas
28/5/20 21:29 - Lorena: Jajaja, el otro día hice un poco...los findes no hago!!
28/5/20 21:30 - Lorena: Podría enseñarte mmm, hice una cosa que me gustó..un salón, donde metí todos los ejercicios que modelé hasta ahora
28/5/20 21:31 - Lorena: Pero no me gusta, pq ellos eligen los objetos que tuvimos que modelar, sus materiales, entonces no me gusta el estilo jajajaj
28/5/20 21:43 - Joe: Haha it’s alright you should still send it to me. I want to see it! It will be like when I showed you my dice game when it was ugly 😂 you can always change it after being graded on it to match your style too
28/5/20 21:44 - Joe: I’d like to see it and maybe if you change it later I will have an idea of the before and after haha
29/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Eooo
29/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Me quedé dormida en el sofá
29/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Tomé una pastilla para la alergia, ebastina y me da sueño jjj
29/5/20 0:39 - Lorena: Siiii tenés razón!
29/5/20 0:50 - Joe: Haha those allergy pill knock you out 😂 No worries, sleep well babe. Buenas noches 😘
29/5/20 8:33 - Lorena: Buenos días, ay que mal dormí 🙈
29/5/20 8:34 - Lorena: Me gusta babe
29/5/20 8:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 8:39 - Joe: Why didn’t you sleep well? Too much noise again?
29/5/20 8:40 - Joe: ♥️
29/5/20 8:40 - Joe: https://youtu.be/BQ4c54rCJ_k
29/5/20 8:41 - Lorena: No, alergia, calor/frío
29/5/20 8:41 - Joe: Some Reebok or some nike always makes me feel better 😂
29/5/20 8:42 - Lorena: jajajajaj
29/5/20 8:42 - Joe: That sucks though. Sorry. Get you some extra strong coffee
29/5/20 8:43 - Lorena: Que tal el español?
29/5/20 8:43 - Lorena: Síii ya tengo uno en mi mano jajajaa
29/5/20 8:45 - Joe: My spanish? Terrible haha
29/5/20 8:45 - Lorena: Pinochito, eso es mentira
29/5/20 8:47 - Joe: Eh I still can’t talk to you on the phone and that really sucks. So not good enough
29/5/20 8:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 8:56 - Joe: I was thinking lately about how awkward it’s going to be to try and talk on the phone for the first time.  I hope you’re ready for that  haha 
I’ll barely understand anything and not be able to form great responses. It’s really not going to be easy at first and might feel really strange.
29/5/20 8:56 - Lorena: Jaja yo también lo pensé el día que te llamé sin querer, dije, mierda... No podemos hablar
29/5/20 8:57 - Lorena: Pero estamos buscando la manera de comunicarnos y me alegro por ello, ya llegará. Prometo aprender inglés jaja
29/5/20 8:58 - Lorena: Que locura!!!!
29/5/20 8:59 - Joe: I just want you to be prepared for it to be difficult and a little weird at first. It might even feel discouraging the first time. 

I’m willing to work through all that and I’m trying to be upfront about the reality of how hard it might be since it’ll take time
29/5/20 9:01 - Lorena: Estuve viendo algunos vídeos, creo que es necesario que la gente responda así, que de vuelta al mundo esta noticia y que se haga justicia ... Lo único que al final, con tanta violencia pueden salir muchos heridos, incluso policías que no tienen culpa de ello e igual ni defienden comos se comportaron esos 4 compañeros y eso no me gusta
29/5/20 9:02 - Lorena: Jajaja si me lo decís así .. bueno en algún momento lo haremos o podemos hacerño al conocernos en el aeropuerto, te imaginas?
29/5/20 9:02 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/5/20 9:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 9:07 - Joe: Hahaha that would be great actually 😂
29/5/20 9:07 - Joe: Yeah I agree. It’s getting a little out of hand, hopefully more people aren’t hurt. The people that live there will live with the destruction for a long time
29/5/20 9:10 - Joe: I honestly wouldn’t mind not being able to communicate in person compared to on the phone. I think I can figure out how to get the idea across for most things in person but on the phone it’s all verbal.
29/5/20 9:13 - Lorena: Exactooo, a mí no sé hasta qué punto me importaría pq aunque no te conozco en persona sé varias cosas de tu vida, y podría decir que me sentiría en confianza aunque no sepa casi nada, supongo que la sonrisas, las miradas y los gestos nos ayudarán
29/5/20 9:19 - Joe: sólo quiero ser un mimo con usted jaja sería tan divertido
29/5/20 9:20 - Joe: sólo quiero ser un mimo contigo jaja sería tan divertido
29/5/20 9:20 - Joe: Better haha
29/5/20 9:20 - Lorena: Mucho mejor!!!!
29/5/20 9:21 - Lorena: Jaja es muy "guiri" cuando alguien dice usted
29/5/20 9:21 - Lorena: O podría ser " solo quiero ser un mimo con vos/tu"
29/5/20 9:24 - Joe: jaha voy a tratar de traducir lo que digo antes de enviarlo más a menudo para que pueda obtener algunas cosas raras. Voy a tratar de corregirlo antes de enviarlo. buenas prácticas
29/5/20 9:24 - Joe: Con vos haha like you would say
29/5/20 9:24 - Lorena: Esta bien que pienses y veas el error
29/5/20 9:25 - Lorena: Esooo es!! Jjj me hace ilusión que aprendas español con mi acento
29/5/20 9:26 - Lorena: Si a mí me toca hablar con alguien en inglés, y hace una comedia rica le direee " this shit hella slaps yoo" era así no?
29/5/20 9:28 - Joe: Hahah people will be so confused about how you learned that out of all the English phrases to learn 😂
29/5/20 9:30 - Lorena: Jajaja
29/5/20 9:30 - Lorena: Estoy deseando poder utiliSr eso cuando hagas tortitas
29/5/20 9:32 - Joe: Hahaha you have to use “smackin” for the tortitas 🥞 “Slaps” and “slappin” for the music 🎶
29/5/20 9:33 - Lorena: Ahhhhh
29/5/20 9:33 - Lorena: Jajaj pensé que servía para todo
29/5/20 9:33 - Lorena: Jajaj perfecto entendió, lo voy a apuntar en mis notas
29/5/20 9:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 9:35 - Lorena: Estas cosas que aprendí fue de friends jajaja solo apunté las que me interesaban 😅
29/5/20 9:36 - Joe: Hahah you definitely have some interesting ones 😂
29/5/20 20:53 - Joe: Buenos diaaaas. I’m out skating as you saw haha. It’s soo hot I’m dying out here. Got a long skate home now
29/5/20 20:54 - Joe: Well buenos días for me hahah i meant holaaaa
29/5/20 20:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 21:26 - Lorena: hoooolaaa!!!
29/5/20 21:27 - Lorena: Siii vi en el sitio bonitooo!
29/5/20 21:27 - Lorena: Acá mucho calor en Madrid también! Buena patinada de vuelta a casa
29/5/20 21:28 - Lorena: Que linda es hasta la calle jaja, super verde ese césped. Quiero se barquito
29/5/20 21:30 - Lorena: Yo hoy firmé contrato de la casa! Se fue nuestra compañera la loca, que felicidad!!!
29/5/20 21:37 - Lorena: Joe, como puedo robar internet al vecino?
29/5/20 21:38 - Lorena: Bueno... Jajaja compartir sin que el sepa, es que no tenemos wifi ahora mismo hasta el lunes 😣
29/5/20 21:40 - Joe: Hahaha unless he has an unsecured router you’d have to guess their password or trick them into giving it to you. Social engineering haha
29/5/20 21:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: Jajaja no, sería sin que se enteren. Como puedo hacerlo?
29/5/20 21:45 - Lorena: Buuu pensé que eras un nerd rebelde jajaja
29/5/20 21:46 - Joe: Haha accessing password protected systems is all about tricking the person, not the computer.
29/5/20 21:47 - Joe: That’s why people send “fishing emails”. A fake email that looks real and ask for your info. Then instead of sending it to the bank or internet service provider or whatever, the info goes to the hacker dude haha
29/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: Mmm no hay ningún programita que se pueda averiguar su clave?
29/5/20 21:51 - Joe: If the password is halfway decent no program can guess it in a reasonable time.
29/5/20 21:51 - Joe: Also some things only let you guess a few times before sending an email or requesting you reset the password. 

Soooorrrryyy 😐
29/5/20 21:53 - Lorena: Mmmm
29/5/20 22:07 - Lorena: Jaja okey okeyyy
30/5/20 0:01 - Lorena: Que tal patinando??
30/5/20 0:04 - Joe: estaba bien. Realmente necesito una nueva tabla y zapatos, pero todavía era divertido
30/5/20 0:05 - Joe: I haven’t skated as much as I should’ve while I’ve been out here too. So I’m not feeling as good on the board as I usually do
30/5/20 0:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 0:09 - Lorena: Jaja bueno, está bien también, estuviste relajado y cuando vuelvas 🔥
30/5/20 0:12 - Joe: Haha hopefully. Less than two weeks left of relaxing. How was your day??
30/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: Muy bien, estuve en un rio pasando la mañana, me dio el sol, estaba súper blanca
30/5/20 0:18 - Lorena: Y luego algo importante, la compañera se fue esta mañana y firmamos nuevo contrato con el dueño de la casa, era casi seguro, pero hasta que no firmasemos ..buscar piso otra vez en Madrid sería horrible jaja
30/5/20 0:19 - Joe: Damn well it sounds like things were going well for you today haha
30/5/20 0:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 0:33 - Lorena: Jaja, noo tanto no! Solo me pican un poco los cachetes
30/5/20 21:16 - Joe: Holaaa

Everything is going to shit in the US haha. Hella cities were protesting yesterday. Shit is getting wild
30/5/20 21:47 - Lorena: Buenos días para vos!!
30/5/20 21:50 - Lorena: Siiii, es incontrolable cómo está la gente por lo que se ve en las noticias!
30/5/20 21:55 - Joe: I wonder how long this will last. Oakland had some stuff happening last night that looked so crazy.
30/5/20 21:56 - Lorena: Sii? Que pasó?
30/5/20 21:56 - Lorena: Y por dónde vivís vos? Esta seguro?
30/5/20 21:56 - Joe: Oh some good news I guess....rocket launched today haha https://youtu.be/pMsvr55cTZ0
30/5/20 21:57 - Joe: They were just breaking into buildings, starting fires, stealing stuff. Even saw a video of someone stealing a new car from an indoor dealership. They drove it right out the door 🤯
30/5/20 21:59 - Lorena: 😱😱😱
30/5/20 22:01 - Lorena: Boludo el mundo está loco, nuestra generación está viviendo unas cosas super fuertes
30/5/20 22:03 - Joe: So much shit. The protest remind me of occupy wallstreet protest but with a lot more anger.
30/5/20 22:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:08 - Lorena: Hijo de puta las manos le cortaba
30/5/20 22:09 - Lorena: Dioosss que fuerte
30/5/20 22:10 - Joe: That was thrown inside of CNN headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Soooo crazy
30/5/20 22:11 - Lorena: Increíble
30/5/20 22:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: Siiii
30/5/20 22:21 - Lorena: La vii, y me encaaantó!!!
30/5/20 22:22 - Lorena: Si esto me recuerda también, la gente se revela, todos seríamos como joker
30/5/20 22:25 - Joe: Yeah that was a really good movie. I loved the concept. He was just pushed too far and lost it
30/5/20 22:25 - Joe: Now that’s happening to everyone
30/5/20 22:26 - Joe: My friend was at the protest in Oakland last night and is telling me downtown is completely destroyed.
30/5/20 22:28 - Lorena: Si el guión muy bueno, pero la música, las tomas, y el actor, todo demasiado bueno, la ví en el cine
30/5/20 22:32 - Lorena: Que locura! Igual terminan las protestas antes de que llegues
30/5/20 22:36 - Joe: I’m going back to so much chaos haha. Much different than being secluded on the island. Island life was nice while it lasted I guess. 


I’ll be back though
30/5/20 22:37 - Joe: How are you feeling today?
30/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: Jaja sí, yo con vos si me dejas un lugar
30/5/20 22:38 - Lorena: Super bien el día hoy
30/5/20 22:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 22:50 - Joe: That spot looks pretty cool! I love how excited you sound hahah
30/5/20 22:51 - Joe: You always with the drink in hand 🍻
30/5/20 22:53 - Joe: I don’t know why but I love when you say something is “super bien” hahaha that’s probably so random but it’s true 😂
30/5/20 22:55 - Lorena: Jajaja si, llevábamos horas pensando si no obedecer a las reglas del gobierno. Teníamos la opción de ir a un bar es lo que está permitido o en una casa, pero nosotras teníamos ganas de estar ahí . Es una mini poza y es súper íntima jaja nadie te molesta
30/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: 🙈 que mala imagen te doy jaja
30/5/20 22:56 - Lorena: Cómo? Jajaj mmm no entendí esto repetimelo porfi
30/5/20 22:58 - Joe: Ooh that sounds like my favorite kind of place. With no people haha. So weird that they let you go to a bar but not into nature. A bar seems much more likely to get you sick than sunbathing at a cool spot like that. I hope they don’t catch you hahah
30/5/20 22:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/5/20 23:00 - Joe: I like the phrase “super bien” when you say it. 

You’ve said it a few times when you send me audio and you always say it in such a happy way haha
30/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: Si jaja quieren recaudar dinero, pero nosotras tomamos buena decisión, jaja cuando nos fuimos al coche estábamos contentas jaja
30/5/20 23:03 - Lorena: Jajaja fuck
30/5/20 23:05 - Lorena: Ah jajaja si? No me doy cuenta, pero si un súper día así me hace feliz
30/5/20 23:09 - Joe: I like that you all wanted to go to a spot like that, even though you’re not supposed to haha
30/5/20 23:10 - Joe: Glad you had a good time.
30/5/20 23:11 - Joe: Yeah I can definitely hear it in your voice. Makes me wonder what you sound like when your mad 😡 hahaa I cant imagine it
30/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: Jajaja mmm sonará mal, supongo como a todo el mundo cuando se enfada jajaja
30/5/20 23:16 - Lorena: Gracias Joseph! Jaja
30/5/20 23:17 - Lorena: Como estás vos?? Ayer patinando mucho o algo más? Hoy cómo se presenta?
30/5/20 23:21 - Joe: Yeah skated a lot yesterday so I’m a liiittle sore today. But I still went to skate early this morning. I need to be ready for summer cause everyday will be a long day of skating. My skateboard is falling apart but I’m so close to going back I need to make it last. 

It’s cloudy now so I’ll be at home for the rest of the day. I have to work on some stuff today.
30/5/20 23:23 - Joe: Which reminds me...you still have to show me your 3d model you made sometime, even though you don’t like it. I’m not going to forget haha
30/5/20 23:27 - Lorena: Ohhh jaja siii, ahí es caro para volver con una tabla de Hawaii?
30/5/20 23:28 - Lorena: En que trabajas hoy??
30/5/20 23:29 - Lorena: Yo vuelvo a trabajar en mi trabajo, sabes qué día?? El día de tu vuelo a California jaja me pareció casualidad
30/5/20 23:30 - Lorena: Ohhhh jaja no te olvidas ehh, si el lunes te prometo que te mando cuando recupere el wifi jajaja
30/5/20 23:33 - Joe: Just helping to make some visual changes to a website for someone. It’s a website I worked on previously.
30/5/20 23:35 - Joe: Haha damn back to work. I really hope we keep talking as things get back to normal. I’m still practicing my spanish everyday 😂
30/5/20 23:35 - Lorena: Que biennn! Yujuu
30/5/20 23:36 - Lorena: Espero que me sigas hablando vos cuando vuelvas a California, estarás super ocupado con el skate jaja
30/5/20 23:37 - Lorena: Luego quiero verlo, tenés que mostrarmelo
30/5/20 23:40 - Joe: Haha It’ll definitely be a little more effort to keep in touch but I’ll do my best.
30/5/20 23:43 - Joe: But I do want to make that if it becomes too much or too difficult that you’ll say something. Just be honest about everything is all I really ask.
30/5/20 23:47 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll send the link when it’s done ✅
30/5/20 23:50 - Lorena: No entiendo, a que te referís?
30/5/20 23:52 - Lorena: Mm no sé si es malo o bueno
30/5/20 23:52 - Joe: Hmm....if you feel like continuing to talk to me is too much effort or you’re just not into it anymore for whatever reason, I want you to communicate that to me
30/5/20 23:54 - Lorena: Mmm para nada! Me gusta hablar con vos Joe, no me va a pasar eso!
30/5/20 23:55 - Lorena: Vos pensás que a vos si? Jaja
30/5/20 23:58 - Joe: I don’t want to stop talking to you for any reason and I know you feel the same. 

But if for some reason things change when our schedules get busy I want you to be able to talk to me about without feeling bad or anything.
31/5/20 0:04 - Lorena: Mmm
31/5/20 0:04 - Lorena: Bueno si algo pasa, te lo diré.  Vos a mí también pinocho
31/5/20 0:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:13 - Joe: Oh yeah I never asked haha what is your job right now?
31/5/20 0:13 - Lorena: Jajaja divertido este robo!
31/5/20 0:14 - Lorena: Por un lado hago proyectos por mi cuenta, y por otro para tener un ingreso fijo trabajo en un showroom de mobiliario
31/5/20 0:18 - Joe: Oh ok that’s cool.
31/5/20 0:19 - Joe: If the furniture showroom is opening, most things must be opening at that time, no?
31/5/20 0:21 - Lorena: No es cool jaja, solo estoy ahí por qué es un sueldo fijo..  hay a otras chicas que les gusta a mí me aburre un poco 🙄
31/5/20 0:21 - Lorena: Todas las tiendas inferiores a 400m2 abrieron, las que son más grandes, como la mía, solo puede abrir una o dos plantas
31/5/20 0:25 - Joe: Hahah we have to get you your own business up and running. Lore the designer
31/5/20 0:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:28 - Lorena: Jaja sí en algún momento! 💪
31/5/20 0:29 - Lorena: Estoy esperando a terminar de aprender el 3D y así hacer un portfolio más completo
31/5/20 0:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:34 - Joe: Haha I understand that. I need to work on my portfolio. It’s a disaster. I should hire someone to redesign it for me
31/5/20 0:37 - Lorena: Pero por qué no lo hacés vos? Como es el portfolio que entregas en tu profesión?
31/5/20 0:43 - Joe: I made one. But it’s ugly. I use it to show clients that I can make stuff haha. Although most of my clients so far I’ve got from word of mouth(referrals)

https://hone1er.github.io/reactPortfolio/
31/5/20 0:45 - Joe: I need to add more projects that I’ve done and do a complete redesign of the look. But I suck at design so I need to hire someone haha
31/5/20 0:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 0:55 - Lorena: Lo veo bien el portfolio, está claro. No sé por qué decís que está mal
31/5/20 0:55 - Joe: Oh yeah that’s true. I did do a bunch of work to make sure it looks good on mobile
31/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: Es diferente a como entregamos nosotros, documento PDF con texto e imágenes
31/5/20 0:56 - Lorena: Lo sé jaja
31/5/20 0:56 - Joe: 😬
31/5/20 0:57 - Joe: I don’t know I just don’t think it looks good. I should make it more “professional” looking. Straight lines, black and white, you know like a modern look
31/5/20 0:58 - Joe: It could be cleaner. And the section where i show my work could be done better. Especially as I add more projects
31/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: Puedo intentar ayudarte si querés
31/5/20 0:59 - Lorena: Volvemos a trabajar juntos jaja
31/5/20 1:00 - Joe: I’ll take I’ll the help I can get but you don’t have to haha
31/5/20 1:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:06 - Joe: That is the files with the code but even that should have a better “readMe” that explains what it was
31/5/20 1:08 - Joe: That wasn’t a website. It was some code that automated the process of transferring scores from one website to another for my friend that is a teacher. It’s hard to display stuff like that in a portfolio haha
31/5/20 1:08 - Lorena: Mmm vale
31/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: No entendí nada jaja
31/5/20 1:09 - Joe: Hahaha
31/5/20 1:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:09 - Joe: 😂
31/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: Pensé que era algo como que dabas clases, como profesor
31/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: Y entré al link y ví última actividad 8 meses y 0 ref, etc
31/5/20 1:10 - Lorena: A eso me refería yo
31/5/20 1:11 - Lorena: Falta la web de tu amigo, esa que me mostraste de ropa . Esa estaba bien también
31/5/20 1:12 - Joe: Oh yeah that’s because I didn’t finish it yet. 

I have a bunch of unfinished websites hahaha.
31/5/20 1:13 - Joe: I’m still waiting on my friend to give me the items and all the info I need.
31/5/20 1:18 - Lorena: Mmmm jaja ya estoy dándole vueltas
31/5/20 1:19 - Joe: The portfolio? What are you doing hahah
31/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:19 - Lorena: Jaja sí
31/5/20 1:20 - Lorena: Estaba mirando otros portfolios d desarrolladores web
31/5/20 1:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:20 - Joe: Oooh that’s a good idea
31/5/20 1:21 - Lorena: Creo que hay que elegir esos colores, blanco y negro e incluso otro que haga contraste. Solo tres
31/5/20 1:22 - Lorena: Una foto tuya o algo, siempre es más fiable poner cara
31/5/20 1:23 - Lorena: Y separar por bloques las cosas, solo en una vista que se pueda pinchar lo que realmente interesa
31/5/20 1:24 - Lorena: Si al final hay alguien que duda, no bajará hasta abajo
31/5/20 1:25 - Joe: Sounds like a lot of work haha I agree on the colors and maybe a picture would be good too.
31/5/20 1:26 - Joe: I don’t know how I’d do the layout to make the blocks better like you say
31/5/20 1:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:26 - Joe: Mmm ok ok
31/5/20 1:27 - Lorena: https://www.lancetalent.com/blog/crear-portfolio-freelance-fp/
31/5/20 1:27 - Joe: But then I need to have a design for both mobile and desktop
31/5/20 1:28 - Joe: Oh siiiick. Alright I’ll take a look at this
31/5/20 1:30 - Lorena: Claro
31/5/20 1:31 - Lorena: Jaja así prácticas español también
31/5/20 1:32 - Joe: Haha true
31/5/20 1:32 - Joe: I was thinking I should get a book in spanish haha.
31/5/20 1:33 - Joe: Oh also, I want to make a simple website that is basically flash cards with the words in the list that I made
31/5/20 1:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:34 - Joe: 😂 no te gusta?
31/5/20 1:34 - Lorena: Tarjetas? De que lista?
31/5/20 1:35 - Lorena: Nada ese color rosa 🤢 supuestamente este es uno de los ejemplos jaja
31/5/20 1:36 - Lorena: Pero el primero que sale, pone un detallito naranja en la palabra portfolio y luego una franja debajo
31/5/20 1:36 - Joe: Hmm “flash cards” is like in school you write on a card to study. You put a question on the front and answer on the back.
31/5/20 1:37 - Joe: I want to make a my own flash cards but on the computer cause it would be more fun than writing them on actual cards haha
31/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: Síii pero de qué? De idioma decís?
31/5/20 1:39 - Joe: Yeah I really like the first one. Very clean, lots of attention to detail.
31/5/20 1:39 - Joe: Oh yeah language. The list of your words
31/5/20 1:39 - Lorena: Y su foto también me gusta, el toque del gorro informal
31/5/20 1:41 - Lorena: El tuyo, los rulitos y un gorro que no ponga math ( para el trabajo nada de política jaja)
31/5/20 1:42 - Joe: Haha now I need a new design and a photo shoot
31/5/20 1:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:44 - Lorena: Mmmm y cómo vas a hacer esa web, ya pensaste en diseño?
31/5/20 1:46 - Joe: Not at all. I usually make it functional before doing the design but maybe if I do the design first it will come out better.
31/5/20 1:46 - Joe: I won’t have to make so many changes either
31/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Mmm jajaja tantas preguntas
31/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Me entra mucha curiosidad todo esto
31/5/20 1:49 - Lorena: Pero te dejaré trabajar!
31/5/20 1:50 - Lorena: Que tengas buena tarde y sea productivo el día!
31/5/20 1:50 - Joe: Alright if you say so. Ask questions anytime haha
31/5/20 1:51 - Joe: Gracias!
31/5/20 1:51 - Joe: I’ll talk to you later. Buenas nochesss
31/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: Gracias!
31/5/20 1:52 - Lorena: Esta Kenya en mi cama, está teniendo pesadillas jaja
31/5/20 1:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/5/20 1:54 - Joe: Well I hope* k goodniiiight haha
31/5/20 1:55 - Lorena: Jajaja, buenas noches, muak 😘
31/5/20 21:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 0:49 - Lorena: Eyyy holaaaa
1/6/20 0:49 - Lorena: Perdona no te respondí, justo volvía de la sierra y vino Luchi a casa, su primera noche
1/6/20 0:51 - Lorena: Síii no dije nada cuando vi tu mensaje por qué no quería "desvelarte"
1/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Jajaja estás muy cansado?
1/6/20 0:57 - Joe: Haha no worries
1/6/20 0:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 0:57 - Joe: Well I was this morning haha I had coffee and did my usual morning stuff so I’m good now
1/6/20 0:59 - Lorena: Que que tal como fue la mañana?
1/6/20 0:59 - Lorena: Hoy diste clase?
1/6/20 0:59 - Joe: Super bien haha
1/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/6/20 1:00 - Joe: No class today yet. I might call later though. How was your day? You must be stoked to have your friend there with you now.
1/6/20 1:01 - Joe: Does this mean I’m a secret haha
1/6/20 1:02 - Lorena: Siiii, ella estará un mes solo, pero espero que sirva para su relación y pueda tomar una decisión!
1/6/20 1:02 - Lorena: Cómo? Jaja
1/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Yeah that should give her some decent time and space to think about stuff. And she’s with a friend so it seems healthy.
1/6/20 1:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 1:09 - Lorena: Siiiii, con Sandra hicimos de cenar una pizza y un lambrusco( vino rosado) jaja para su bienvenida
1/6/20 1:09 - Lorena: Jajaj decimeee
1/6/20 1:10 - Lorena: Un secretoo?
1/6/20 1:12 - Joe: Your message translated to you not wanting to reveal me. So i was asking does Luchi not know about me? I was just playing around though haha
1/6/20 1:14 - Joe: Lit haha sounds like she will have a great month there 😂 

Too bad you have to go back to work soon
1/6/20 1:14 - Lorena: Ahhh jajaja
1/6/20 1:15 - Lorena: Vos no sos secreto para nada bombón!
1/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: Si quería decir que cuando vi tu mensaje de Instagram, vi que era super pronto y no quería que te desveles...
1/6/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 1:20 - Lorena: 😬
1/6/20 1:23 - Joe: Do you have any fun plans before you have to go back to work? You have to take advantage of the time you have left haha
1/6/20 1:23 - Lorena: Jajaja que gif de respuesta 🥴
1/6/20 1:24 - Joe: Hahaha whatever dude
1/6/20 1:27 - Lorena: Okkkey dudee
1/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Si llevo todos estos días haciendo lo que más me gusta, hacer planes de naturaleza.. con mi familia, amigos, etc
1/6/20 1:31 - Joe: Siiick. Yeah I’m trying to take advantage of my time out here. Just about 1 week to go 😞
1/6/20 1:32 - Lorena: Sii, tenemos el mismo tiempo
1/6/20 1:32 - Joe: Remember when we first started talking it felt like it would never end? Haha now we’re counting down the days
1/6/20 1:34 - Lorena: Jaja yo no lo pasé mal durante la cuarentena, solo un poco de incertidumbre algún momento por no saber cuándo volver a la vida normal
1/6/20 1:35 - Lorena: Ahora estoy disfrutando del tiempo libre sin trabajar y con una semana para asimilarlo jaja
1/6/20 1:36 - Lorena: Vos, ya tenés casa en California? Cuáles son tus planes?
1/6/20 1:38 - Joe: No I didn’t find anything online so I’m just going to go to my parents for a bit while I look in person. 

Work doesn’t start until the 15th so I have so time when I get back to figure it out. Maybe the riots have lowered rent prices haha
1/6/20 1:40 - Lorena: Haces bien, además es mejor estar ahí y poder ir a ver la habitación, muchas veces las fotos engañan
1/6/20 1:42 - Lorena: Cuánto tiempo es el skatecamp? Del 15.. hasta?
1/6/20 1:43 - Joe: It goes until school starts at in August. I think it’s about 10 weeks total.
1/6/20 1:44 - Lorena: Uoo, es tiempo! Pensé que sería menos
1/6/20 1:45 - Lorena: Y cómo es? Duermen en algún sitio todos juntos? O solo clases de skate en un skatepark?
1/6/20 1:46 - Joe: It’s only a daytime thing so just lessons in the park. The kids are dropped off weekday mornings and picked up every afternoon.
1/6/20 1:47 - Joe: We also have a building that has games and stuff in it but I’m not sure how much we’ll be using that stuff this year. It’s going to be really weird, with a bunch of special rules this year.
1/6/20 1:49 - Lorena: Ah muy bien, se te pasa rápido seguro enseñándoles
1/6/20 1:50 - Lorena: Yaaa, todo cambia! Mucho protocolo! Cuántos niños apuntados hay?
1/6/20 1:53 - Joe: I think they’re going to limit it to 10 children per “session”. The sessions used to be 1 week but now I think they’ll be 2 or 4 weeks so that the kids aren’t switching camps as often.
1/6/20 1:54 - Joe: I’m wondering how much staff they’ll give us though. Last year we had the bare minimum. We definitely could’ve used one more staff member. 

But now since we get less kids, I’m sure they’ll try to give us less staff again
1/6/20 1:58 - Lorena: Antes eran más de 10 niños por sesión? Cuántos profesores?
1/6/20 2:00 - Lorena: Seguramente se apunten varios niños, los padres estén desesperados todo este tiempo y deben querer enviarlos a que gasten toda su energía con Joe jajaj
1/6/20 2:00 - Joe: Hahah I hope a lot of kids sign up. I’m pretty sure we can get at least 10 haha.
1/6/20 2:01 - Joe: I don’t know how many teachers we get. Hopefully 3. They’ll probably try to make us do it with 2(me and one other)
1/6/20 2:38 - Lorena: Ah genial! Seguro que hay mucho trabajo
1/6/20 2:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 2:49 - Joe: Haha for sure. As long as this one kid from last year doesn’t come it’ll be all good 😂
1/6/20 3:05 - Lorena: Jajaja ese niño sabelotodo
1/6/20 3:06 - Lorena: Me voy a dormiuir Joe, un beso, 😘 disfruta de tu tarde
1/6/20 3:08 - Joe: Oook talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
1/6/20 9:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 12:15 - Lorena: I miss talking to you! 🐻
1/6/20 14:23 - Joe: Damn was I must’ve fallen asleep so early to not see your messages. I’m sorry. Good afternoon haha
1/6/20 14:24 - Joe: You’re hella sweet. I miss talking to you too babe. I’ll be up in a few hours I’m sure haha. Ok I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soooon 😘
1/6/20 14:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 14:33 - Lorena: Siiii, sin problema. Que duermas super bien ! Luego hablamos, hoy estaré por casa por fin jajaja
1/6/20 14:34 - Lorena: 💚
1/6/20 14:34 - Lorena: Jajajajaja un besote lindo!
1/6/20 19:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:18 - Lorena: Jajaja buenos díasss!
1/6/20 19:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:33 - Joe: I wish! Oooh i will be so happy the day I get to wake up and have breakfast with you haha
1/6/20 19:33 - Joe: Can’t come soon enough
1/6/20 19:38 - Lorena: Jjj, espero que prontooo, o por lo menos pensar en que queremos eso los dos, esta bien!
1/6/20 19:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:45 - Lorena: Es que antes el pobre de cayó, jajaja así que tuvo que pedirnos a mi amiga y a mí que le vayamos sujetando la escalera
1/6/20 19:46 - Joe: Hahaha whaaat, he fell? That sucks haha. That’s good you’re helping.
1/6/20 19:47 - Lorena: Jajaja si aunque a él se me cayó su grapadora metálica en mi muñeca
1/6/20 19:47 - Lorena: Es peruano! Así que me acordé de vos jjj
1/6/20 19:49 - Joe: Ow that sucks too haha.
1/6/20 19:50 - Joe: Aaayyyyeee Peruvian in the house hahah niiiice. I don’t meet many Peruvians
1/6/20 19:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 19:56 - Lorena: Hice ese audio mientras le preguntaba jaja para que escuches su acento, es cerrado no sé si se entiende pero le dije que tenía un amigo( vos) que decía "que palta" jaja y el empezó a repetirlo
1/6/20 20:00 - Joe: Hahaha I definitely noticed that part. His accent reminds me of some of the cartoon characters that are in those casi creativo videos 😂 Hard to hear him super well though.
1/6/20 20:01 - Lorena: Jajaja a mí al principio me costó, muy cerrado
1/6/20 20:02 - Lorena: Pobre lleva horas intentando instalarnos el wifi
1/6/20 20:03 - Lorena: Se cayó de las escaleras y se raspó todo el brazo, que susto nos dió jajaja pobre con los guantes y la mascarilla trabajando le dije que podía quitársela
1/6/20 20:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 20:05 - Lorena: No podía parar de recordar este vídeo, jajaja tuve que buscarlo
1/6/20 20:05 - Joe: Hahaha woah 😱
1/6/20 20:06 - Lorena: Jajaja no puedo parar de reír siempre que veo este vídeo, se ríe al final está bien
1/6/20 20:10 - Joe: I was a little worried at first until he started laughing hahah what a tumble
1/6/20 20:23 - Lorena: No soy tan mala jaja, pero si suelo reírme bastante con caídas o cosas del estilo, (sin que se hagan daño)
1/6/20 20:33 - Joe: Ooooh then you would like some of my favorite Instagram pages hahaha
1/6/20 20:33 - Joe: https://instagram.com/americasgotnotalent?igshid=1heth6katuvvk
1/6/20 20:34 - Joe: I was going to send girlsGettingHurt but I see you follow them already hahah. Nice
1/6/20 20:34 - Joe: https://instagram.com/kidsgettinghurt?igshid=tf911i9nebds
1/6/20 20:47 - Lorena: Jajaja genial, acabo de seguir a estas dos que me enviaste
1/6/20 20:48 - Lorena: https://instagram.com/kookslams?igshid=1wk70ey86125d
1/6/20 20:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 20:52 - Joe: Haha I already follow kook slams. That page is good 😂
1/6/20 20:53 - Lorena: Ah es que lo miré pero no salias en la lista de mis amigos
1/6/20 20:53 - Lorena: Ah sí ahora sí jaja
1/6/20 20:55 - Joe: I’m glad you like those kind of videos. Some people don’t find it funny at all. I fall all the time and I still think it’s hilarious
1/6/20 20:57 - Lorena: Jaja sí, siempre me entra risa cuando veo a alguien que se cae o hace algo torpe...intento no reírme por ver si se hizo daño.. pero me cuesta no hacerlo
1/6/20 21:01 - Lorena: Aunque si veo que se hizo daño grave no me hace tanta gracia...me da pena
1/6/20 21:05 - Joe: Oh yeah of course! But I’m glad you find it funny when they’re not hurt. You’ll enjoy watching me skateboard in person, I fall a lot 😂
1/6/20 21:07 - Lorena: Jajaja si podría reírme seguro
1/6/20 21:07 - Lorena: Aunque hay una parte de mi que seguro estaría nerviosa por si te haces daño jaja
1/6/20 21:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 21:13 - Joe: If we spend enough time together I’m sure you’ll see me hurt myself pretty bad eventually haha I’ve accepted that injuries are a part of skateboarding by this point
1/6/20 21:15 - Joe: Only 7 days until I leave this place 😩 

I hope California isn’t too fucked up when I get back haha. The Bay Area has definitely been torn apart
1/6/20 21:17 - Lorena: Jajajaja era bastante previsible al verlo encima de la tabla
1/6/20 21:18 - Lorena: Siii, lo sé jaja por lo que vi el skate es técnica y los trucos no salen a la primera asi que supongo que te caerás mucho jaja
1/6/20 21:19 - Lorena: Ohhhh 7 días, cuáles son tus planes estos días? Espero ver alguna foto de alguna casita más antes de que te vayas jaja
1/6/20 21:22 - Joe: Hmmm I’ll probably just skate around a bunch. Go to the beaches near by. Just enjoy the week as much as I can. 

I’ll try to send more pictures haha
1/6/20 21:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 21:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 21:52 - Lorena: Jajaj nostálgico!
1/6/20 21:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 21:56 - Joe: Aún no. Voy a llamar por la tarde.
1/6/20 22:00 - Joe: I wanted to ask you something...I heard in a video that people say “voy a la calle” or “vamos a la calle” for saying they are going out or let’s go out(with no specific place in mind). 

Is that true? What do you say?
1/6/20 22:01 - Joe: For example, is “voy a ir a la calle a patinar” correct?
1/6/20 22:04 - Joe: I guess I could just just say it as “voy a patinar” to make it easy. But I still want to know if the other way is technically correct haha
1/6/20 22:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 22:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 22:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 22:36 - Joe: Haha cool. Gracias
1/6/20 22:37 - Joe: Well I did go skate but I didn’t make it far before my bearing broke so now my wheel doesn’t turn. Had to walk back
1/6/20 22:38 - Lorena: Lo más usado sería que me digas " Lore, me voy a patinar a la calle un rato"
1/6/20 22:39 - Lorena: Ohhhh
1/6/20 22:39 - Lorena: Que putada!
1/6/20 22:41 - Joe: I was so close to making it back without anything breaking haha. The metal parts were getting rusty so it was only a matter of time I guess
1/6/20 22:41 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/6/20 22:42 - Lorena: Y no te podés comprar alguna pieza ahí? La podrás usar estos días y además te quedará de recuerdo jj
1/6/20 22:45 - Joe: Haha maybe I’ll have to see if the skate shop is open. 

Good thing I didn’t get too far before the wheel broke. That would’ve sucked.
1/6/20 22:45 - Joe: I have to write this down in my notebook haha
1/6/20 22:46 - Joe: Anytime you notice a phrase I would use with you often or one you would use all the time with me, tell me the right way and I’ll write it down haha
1/6/20 22:48 - Lorena: Jaja menos mal! Bueno por lo menos pudiste patinar un poco
1/6/20 22:48 - Lorena: Jajaj eso lo dirías mucho seguro
1/6/20 22:49 - Lorena: Mmmm jaja
1/6/20 22:49 - Lorena: "Me quedé dormido super temprano"
1/6/20 22:50 - Lorena: " Me desperté demasiado pronto"
1/6/20 22:50 - Joe: Hahaha
1/6/20 22:50 - Lorena: " voy a tomar un café"
1/6/20 22:50 - Lorena: "Voy a hacer tortitas para desayunar"
1/6/20 22:50 - Lorena: " voy a patinar de camino a la playa"
1/6/20 22:50 - Joe: Damn these are funny haha you don’t have to come up with them right away 😂 😂
1/6/20 22:50 - Joe: Hahah you have so many already
1/6/20 22:51 - Joe: Niiice
1/6/20 22:51 - Lorena: Jajaja eso es todo lo que me decís siempre
1/6/20 22:52 - Lorena: " soy tímido pero vos me sacaste de mi caparazón"
1/6/20 22:52 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/6/20 22:52 - Joe: Well I guess I should switch it up. Surprise you hahah shit
1/6/20 22:52 - Lorena: " soy un fumado, y la gente mayor me regala María por la calle"
1/6/20 22:53 - Joe: Oh god hahaha
1/6/20 22:53 - Lorena: " me gusta todo tipo de música, no me juzgues"
1/6/20 22:53 - Lorena: " voy a arreglar los errores de mi "estúpido" juego"
1/6/20 22:53 - Joe: Hahaha fuck I can’t believe you still talk to me since these are the things I say
1/6/20 22:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/6/20 22:54 - Lorena: Jajajaja
1/6/20 22:54 - Lorena: " soy un friki de la política y me encanta Andrew Yang"
1/6/20 22:55 - Lorena: " me gustaría construir una casita pequeña, tener un buen jardín y animales"
1/6/20 22:56 - Lorena: "me gustaría tener hijos y ser cariñoso con ellos, ya que mi padre por momentos no lo fue conmigo"
1/6/20 22:56 - Lorena: Nada es aburrido
1/6/20 22:57 - Lorena: Me acuerdo bien de las cosas que hablamos jaja para que lo sepas!! ☝️
1/6/20 22:57 - Joe: Ok I didn’t think you’d have so many haha. This gets a new page in the notebook.
1/6/20 22:59 - Joe: Yeah you remembered a lot of stuff haha. I’m a little surprised
1/6/20 23:00 - Joe: Still need stuff you say to me all the time ...or stuff you would say all the time if we we’re in the same place for example. 

But this is a good start
1/6/20 23:04 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/6/20 23:04 - Lorena: Ah muy bien Joe, vos no t acordás de las cosas que yo te digo? Jaja
1/6/20 23:07 - Joe: Haha I remember things we talked about more than specific phrases. You are more unpredictable than me with 1000 more words 😂
1/6/20 23:11 - Joe: But I guess what I really want is phrases you would say often if we were together. Simple everyday stuff like asking if I can get you something or if I want to do some activity or go somewhere with you. 

Basic phrases that might be used daily. Maybe like something you would say to your roommates or friends often.
1/6/20 23:12 - Joe: Not now though haha. Just think about it and if you notice a phrase being used often throughout the day, even if it seems basic to you, tell me what it is. Then I can work on different responses
1/6/20 23:49 - Lorena: Estaba cenando
1/6/20 23:50 - Lorena: 😂
1/6/20 23:50 - Lorena: Mmmm cosas cotidianas que te podría decir?
1/6/20 23:52 - Lorena: Desayunamos juntos?
1/6/20 23:53 - Lorena: Voy a preparar café, querés?
1/6/20 23:53 - Lorena: Voy al super, te apetece que compre algo para cenar?
1/6/20 23:55 - Lorena: Salgo a las 9, prepara algo rico para cenar porfi
1/6/20 23:55 - Joe: Haha yeah those are good. Stuff like that. That way i can think about and practice different responses until it is more natural
1/6/20 23:56 - Lorena: Estoy cansada, me hacés un masaje? Jaja esto es típico en mi, me encantan los masajes jaja
1/6/20 23:58 - Lorena: Que tal dormiste esta noche?  Yo dormí poco, roncabas mucho 😂
1/6/20 23:59 - Lorena: Las perras no hicieron caca, las voy a sacar un rato
2/6/20 0:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/6/20 0:01 - Joe: Hopefully you don’t need this one too often 😂
2/6/20 0:04 - Lorena: Jajaj roncas?
2/6/20 0:08 - Joe: I don’t think I snore a lot but sometimes I do haha. Usually if I’m sleeping in a weird position
2/6/20 0:20 - Lorena: Jaja está bien saberlo!

2/6/20 0:36 - Joe: Thanks hahah. I just want to learn fast so I can communicate with you effectively.
2/6/20 0:38 - Joe: Since I’m the kind of person that only talks to a few people, it is especially frustrating for me that my favorite person to talk to has the most barriers for communication haha
2/6/20 0:40 - Lorena: Ohhh
2/6/20 0:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/6/20 0:44 - Joe: Hahaha Lo siento 😂
2/6/20 0:44 - Lorena: Me refiero a que son bonitas , y solo me dan ganas de teletransportarte acá ahora jaja
2/6/20 0:46 - Joe: Haha I appreciate it. I want to be with you so bad, but I’ll keep my mushy bullshit to a minimum so you can sleep haha
2/6/20 0:47 - Lorena: Muy mushy bullshit jauaja
2/6/20 0:47 - Lorena: My*
2/6/20 0:51 - Lorena: La verdad es que me gusta que me digas esas cosas
2/6/20 0:51 - Joe: Haha I just tell you those things at the wrong time
2/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

2/6/20 1:22 - Lorena: 🥺🥺🥺
2/6/20 1:23 - Joe: Haha I want to talk to you I’m just playing cause you said not to talk a certain way when you’re getting sleepy. I don’t want to keep you up
2/6/20 1:24 - Joe: Well...I do want to keep you up hahaha but if you’re tired I want you to sleep
2/6/20 1:25 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/6/20 1:25 - Lorena: No sé cómo lo haces pero si conseguís mantenerme despierta
2/6/20 1:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Por suerte soy rápida para dormirme, cuando decida en 10 min puedo estar super dormida...así que no t preocupes jaja mientras pueda hacerlo intentaré hablar con vos
2/6/20 1:28 - Joe: Haha yeah I’m sorry I just forget the time difference and start blabbering on about nonsense right around the time you should be going to sleep
2/6/20 1:29 - Joe: Haha nice. I feel like this is me too. I lay down and pass out super fast most of the time. I sleep so fast I need to be careful with getting to comfortable or I’ll fall asleep on accident 😂
2/6/20 1:30 - Joe: I’ve been trying to watch movies lately and I keep falling asleep hella early on the couch
2/6/20 1:30 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/6/20 1:32 - Lorena: Si es nuestra diferencia horaria, yo muchas veces me olvido y te mando mensajes en mi mediodía o algo así y al final los ves en tu madrugada .. también me siento culpable jaja
2/6/20 1:32 - Lorena: Jajaja será difícil que veamos una peli juntos
2/6/20 1:33 - Joe: Hah why? Will you fall asleep too? Sounds great haha
2/6/20 1:35 - Lorena: Jaja sí en el sofá me quedo dormida rápido
2/6/20 1:35 - Joe: Don’t ever feel bad. My sleep schedule is super random sometimes but I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a while and that’s when I see those messages. I don’t mind waking up to a message from you at all. Sometimes I feel bad for not being able to respond cause I was asleep haha
2/6/20 1:36 - Joe: Perfect. If we want to get a little nap we’ll just put on a movie and cuddle on the couch haha
2/6/20 1:36 - Lorena: En el cine aguanto, pero sofá... Buuu jajaj no siempre. Puedo intentarlo
2/6/20 1:37 - Joe: I wouldn’t mind you falling asleep haha no biggie
2/6/20 1:39 - Lorena: 🤗 jaja sí es que justo me pasa que cuando estás dormido quiero mostrarte algun video de perros o niños o algo jajaja y hay veces que lo envío

2/6/20 1:50 - Joe: I hope you realize I’m hella goofy and really would do some shit like dance like an idiot just to make you laugh haha. Don’t be surprised when I do weird shit 😂
2/6/20 1:50 - Lorena: Me hace tanta gracia lo ridículo que es con su pantalón de vestir, zapato y calcetín jajaja en su primer paso jjjj

2/6/20 1:54 - Joe: Hahahah I don’t know if I consider that seduction 😂 😂 but sure haha
2/6/20 1:55 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/6/20 1:55 - Joe: Are we strange for liking Mr Bean? Haha I think he is hella funny. I remember it being played in my families house when I was younger though so I may be biased
2/6/20 1:57 - Lorena: Jaja sí en mi casa también lo veíamos, de hecho cuando sale por la TV y estamos con mi hermano, se ríe de la misma manera, a todos nos hace gracia jaja
2/6/20 1:58 - Lorena: Mmm mi gorro preferido por como te queda es el primero

2/6/20 2:00 - Joe: Haha thank you my fashion expert
2/6/20 2:00 - Joe: Stylist haha
2/6/20 2:01 - Joe: Haha for sure. I appreciate the feedback. Then I can go out feeling confident cause you already confirmed the hat looks good on me
2/6/20 2:02 - Joe: Glad you didn’t pick my dads hat as your favorite hahaha. Not really my style 😂
2/6/20 2:04 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/6/20 2:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

2/6/20 2:22 - Joe: Hahahahaha
2/6/20 2:23 - Joe: I just want to be in the same space as you. I want to fall asleep with you. It sucks that it’ll take so long before I can make that happen
2/6/20 2:26 - Lorena: Yo también quiero eso, de verdad. No puedo entender cómo lo deseo tanto jaja, es como basta, Lorena, está lejos
2/6/20 2:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/6/20 2:29 - Joe: Hahaha aaah well not much I can do about it. All part of the journey I suppose. Might as well have fun with it, make a good memory from the time
2/6/20 2:30 - Lorena: Pero bueno, me alegro de haber hablado hoy un buen rato con vos!
2/6/20 2:31 - Lorena: Así que, gracias! 😘
2/6/20 2:33 - Joe: Haha no problem. I always enjoy our talks. But this time I’ll really let you go to sleep now 😂
2/6/20 2:34 - Joe: Tomorrow we can send more Mr Bean gifs and laugh about nothing haha
2/6/20 2:35 - Lorena: Jajaj si me voy a dormir ya
2/6/20 2:36 - Lorena: Me entró un dolor de cabeza super fuerte, tomé una pastilla a ver si para

2/6/20 14:22 - Lorena: jajaja
2/6/20 14:22 - Lorena: misma fecha de usa a españa, el doble
2/6/20 14:25 - Lorena: I think it can be for two options. 1. The problem now with the death of the black boy. 2. Corona Virus, I looked at the embassy and says that visas cannot be requested until the pandemic ends, Spain being one of the most requested
2/6/20 14:26 - Joe: Hahaha what the hell? So like, that flight takes you to the US then flies back to Spain in the same day?
2/6/20 14:26 - Joe: Oh yeah I guess people might not be too excited to come to the US with all this crazy shit happening
2/6/20 14:28 - Lorena: haha no no, I wanted to know why so cheap, and sent the same flight date, just change the origin and destination and it's double!
2/6/20 14:28 - Lorena: Claro, yo creo que puede ser eso...
2/6/20 14:30 - Lorena: You are asleep? jaja another nap?
2/6/20 14:32 - Joe: I fell asleep on the couch again haha. I woke up cause my stomach was kind of hurting so now I’m just laying here in bed

2/6/20 14:40 - Joe: Hahaha 😂
2/6/20 14:42 - Joe: I have an urge to eat something hot and tasty but I don’t have anything I can make quick that I can think of. 
I hate when I get this kind of urge late in the night haha.
2/6/20 14:46 - Lorena: jajaja
2/6/20 14:47 - Lorena: pobrecito, te prepararía algo!
2/6/20 14:49 - Lorena: intenta descansar para no perder el sueño, y luego desayunas algo rico cuando te despiertes

3/6/20 1:56 - Joe: I just don’t understand what other dudes must be saying for me to keep you interested more than them 😂
3/6/20 2:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 2:41 - Joe: Hah it’s late that’s ok.
3/6/20 2:41 - Joe: You get some sleep. You can always talk to me tomorrow
3/6/20 2:41 - Lorena: Jajaja si, muchas cosas me contás jaja
3/6/20 2:42 - Lorena: Me picaron unos putos mosquitos en el brazo
3/6/20 2:42 - Joe: Dude I have sooo many mosquito bites right now hahah. I don’t know where I was when I got so many
3/6/20 2:43 - Lorena: Ups... Jaja 🙈 hubo una situación rara con esto
3/6/20 2:43 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/6/20 2:44 - Joe: Haha all good you don’t have to respond to that. I was just saying, i feel like I’m boring 😆
3/6/20 2:45 - Lorena: Mmmmm
3/6/20 2:47 - Lorena: Un "amigo" se enfadó conmigo por qué ya no le hablaba y me preguntó si había conocido a alguien
3/6/20 2:49 - Joe: Aaaah ok. Whoops 😬
3/6/20 2:50 - Lorena: Le dije la verdad, que si, aunque era raro...
3/6/20 2:51 - Lorena: Yo no podía mentirle, el no podía creer la distancia entre nosotros 😬
3/6/20 2:52 - Lorena: No te asustes con esto que te cuento jaja, así que no, no me pareces aburrido
3/6/20 2:52 - Joe: Damn now I feel kind of bad haha
3/6/20 2:52 - Lorena: ???
3/6/20 2:52 - Joe: I appreciate the honesty
3/6/20 2:52 - Joe: For him
3/6/20 2:54 - Joe: Cause yeah that must’ve been quiet the shock, especially after learning about the distance. 

But yeah, thanks for telling the truth haha
3/6/20 2:54 - Joe: Quite*
3/6/20 2:55 - Lorena: 🤷
3/6/20 2:57 - Lorena: No sé, es la verdad... No tengo ganas de ver a otros chicos ya
3/6/20 2:59 - Lorena: Pero tu respuesta es que el te da pena 🙈
3/6/20 2:59 - Joe: https://open.spotify.com/track/3YdKJzcoMZMacISlpY4QoP?si=2WQP4oJkRl6CV5Pod56V7A
3/6/20 2:59 - Joe: Hahaha I feel like I should be nervous about you, wild girl
3/6/20 3:01 - Lorena: Cómo? Jaja
3/6/20 3:03 - Joe: Haha nothing never mind. Don’t worry though I definitely am only interested in you. 100% all you
3/6/20 3:07 - Lorena: Ay pero por qué decías eso, quiero entenderlo!
3/6/20 3:12 - Joe: Ok I’ll explain but don’t take it the wrong way because I love who you are as a person. Genuinely. 

You are a beautiful, free spirited, outgoing, funny girl and I sometimes I feel like I could be setting myself up for heartbreak here hahaha
3/6/20 3:13 - Joe: It’s less about me thinking you would do something inappropriate and more that I think I could end up liking you a little too much and get hurt for it. That’s life though, I either open up to you and see what happens or stay in my shell. The stay in the shell option might not be available to me anymore haha
3/6/20 3:18 - Joe: I never know if I explain these things well that’s why I say never mind 😂 I don’t know how to describe what I mean. I hope you get the idea
3/6/20 3:18 - Lorena: Mmm
3/6/20 3:19 - Lorena: Jaja no.. algo como que no me lo tomé a mal.. cosas buenas pero que si me gustas mucho podrías hacerme daño
3/6/20 3:21 - Lorena: 🙈 jdkkfbkd
3/6/20 3:23 - Joe: Yeah I guess I’m just nervous about relationships in general. In that one video I sent you I told you I was planning on focusing on myself and wasn’t trying to talk to anyone like that. I don’t know how to describe it well
3/6/20 3:23 - Joe: I’m super glad I’m talking to you now. And I don’t want to stop or anything like that. I’m just saying that I wasn’t really expecting something like this
3/6/20 3:24 - Joe: I think the way previous relationships have ended make me a little guarded right now
3/6/20 3:28 - Joe: Fuck I really don’t want you to think anything negative about this cause it’s not like some huge deal, I’ve still been super open with you and share as much as I can. If any of that was too big of a deal for me I wouldn’t even be talking to you. It’s a small thing. I’m sure you feel a slight nervousness about getting hurt in the end as well but that’s the risk you take if you want to be with someone
3/6/20 3:29 - Lorena: Mmm no tendría que haber sacado esta conversación
3/6/20 3:30 - Lorena: Jaja por que no sé si estoy entendiendo bien las cosas
3/6/20 3:30 - Joe: Hahah fuck 3:30am 😬 I’m so sorry 😂
3/6/20 3:31 - Joe: You can respond to this tomorrow if you want. No worries
3/6/20 3:31 - Lorena: Yo solo quería decirte que no me pareces aburrido que la muestra está en que no tengo ganas de conocer a otros chicos
3/6/20 3:31 - Joe: 😂
3/6/20 3:32 - Lorena: Pero ahora me estás diciendo que podés hacerme daño, vos a mí? O algo de tus ex? Y que te da miedo?
3/6/20 3:32 - Joe: All good. I’m sorry I opened up too much. Ok ok maybe you should just go to sleep haha
3/6/20 3:32 - Joe: Haha it’s complicated. We can talk about it some other time. It’s not a huge deal at all. Don’t worry
3/6/20 3:33 - Lorena: Me gustaría terminar de hablarlo ahora
3/6/20 3:34 - Joe: Ok. Hmm I don’t know how to explain it in simple terms.
3/6/20 3:36 - Joe: Haha why couldn’t you just accept “never mind” 😂
3/6/20 3:37 - Lorena: Podemos dejarlo en no importa
3/6/20 3:37 - Lorena: Y no hablaríamos ya...
3/6/20 3:38 - Joe: Hhahhha fuck
3/6/20 3:38 - Joe: 😂
3/6/20 3:39 - Joe: Ok I just had a bad breakup or two and I don’t want to go through that with you. I’m scared of having really strong feelings for you
3/6/20 3:39 - Joe: There isn’t much more to it than that
3/6/20 3:43 - Joe: At this point I can’t do anything about it cause I already really like you soooo
3/6/20 3:44 - Lorena: Jaja mmm pero si te da miedo, no deberías plantearte en que alguno de los dos viaje para conocernos
3/6/20 3:44 - Joe: Ok 🙄
3/6/20 3:46 - Joe: Nah but for real...it’s not being nervous about being with you, it’s being nervous about losing you. I fucking hate sounding corny like that but that’s what it is
3/6/20 3:48 - Lorena: Yo estuve 10 años con mi ex, luego con varios chicos pero nunca me dieron ganas de tomarlo en serio... Con vos no lo sé, pero cuando me planteabas la opción de conocernos en persona y demás detalles que tuviste, eso hizo que cambie mi chip
3/6/20 3:51 - Joe: This is why I shouldn’t tell you shit haha. I want to take it seriously with you, otherwise I wouldn’t be nervous at all. It wouldn’t matter. I’m sorry if what I’m saying is making you think I’m having doubts about trying to be with you because that’s not it
3/6/20 3:51 - Lorena: Yo estaba genial soltera, pero ahora me siento atrapada por un chico que conocí durante la cuarentena y no puedo dejar de hablar con él o sonreír cuando veo algún video 😬😬😬
3/6/20 3:53 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I also was very ok with being single. But I would say you trapped me 😆
3/6/20 3:53 - Lorena: Jajaja si era mi objetivo
3/6/20 3:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 3:53 - Lorena: Lo que no sabía es que yo quedaría ahí atrapada también
3/6/20 3:55 - Joe: Hahaha you were just going to message me until you lost interest but you couldn’t stop once you started 😂
3/6/20 3:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 3:55 - Lorena: Mmm algo así jajaja
3/6/20 3:56 - Joe: Good thing I didn’t speak Spanish and I have no idea how to talk to girls or you might have gotten bored by now
3/6/20 3:57 - Lorena: Sé que todo es súper cursi, pero es algo diferente y me siento atraída por esta historia, y aunque no te conozca en persona puedo sentir la buena vibra a tantos km
3/6/20 3:58 - Lorena: Yo de verdad no tenía intención de conocernos en persona, ya que era una locura.. pero vos empezaste a metermelo en la cabeza y no lo veo ya tan imposible
3/6/20 3:59 - Joe: You must be some kind of “hopeless romantic” haha. I like the story too and you got siiick vibes haha
3/6/20 4:01 - Joe: Haha damn sorry about that 😂 

I didn’t plan on it at first either. Honestly I was very skeptical about your reason for messaging me haha. But the more I talked to you the more I wanted to meet you.
3/6/20 4:02 - Joe: Then I started to think about it and there is nothing stopping me from making it happen, it’ll just take some time to get everything situated
3/6/20 4:02 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/6/20 4:03 - Lorena: Entonces ahora no me podés decir que no nos vamos a conocer
3/6/20 4:03 - Lorena: Eso me descolocaría otra vez mi cabeza jajaja, aunque lo tendría que aceptar
3/6/20 4:05 - Joe: Haha I’m not changing my mind on us meeting. That’s the goal right now.
3/6/20 4:07 - Joe: When I get back to the bay I’m going to go do everything to get my passport and by the time that comes I should be able to visit you
3/6/20 4:08 - Lorena: Jaja espero que tus ex u otras chicas de bahía no se interpongan en que nos veamos jajaja
3/6/20 4:08 - Joe: I don’t even know what the plan would be. Like how long do I go and how it all works haha but I’ll figure it out.
3/6/20 4:09 - Joe: Hahah naaah I don’t think that’ll be a problem at all
3/6/20 4:09 - Lorena: Jaja sí podés ir sacando el pasaporte jaja aunque nuestras fronteras están cerradas!
3/6/20 4:11 - Lorena: Jajaja okey pinocho
3/6/20 4:11 - Joe: Hahahaha
3/6/20 4:12 - Joe: https://open.spotify.com/track/3YdKJzcoMZMacISlpY4QoP?si=2WQP4oJkRl6CV5Pod56V7A
3/6/20 4:12 - Joe: No soy pinocho.
3/6/20 4:12 - Joe: “I only have eyes for you” hahaha I just need summer to go by quickly so I can get to you. Things have to be open by then
3/6/20 4:13 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/6/20 4:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 4:14 - Lorena: La voy a escuchar, antes estaba intentando entender todo lo que me contabas
3/6/20 4:14 - Lorena: Algo como
3/6/20 4:14 - Joe: Hahahah what the hell 😂
3/6/20 4:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 4:16 - Joe: Hahah dude you should be asleep 😂 I’m so sorry for keeping you up so long with all this.
3/6/20 4:17 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/6/20 4:17 - Lorena: No pasa nada, todo bien. Aún no tengo que trabajar
3/6/20 4:18 - Lorena: Solo desde casa y puedo tomar un café XL
3/6/20 4:18 - Joe: Oh yeah that’s true, no work. You’re going to be sleeping all day haha
3/6/20 4:18 - Lorena: Creo que este es el día que estuve más tarde, jaja dios 4 am...
3/6/20 4:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 4:19 - Joe: Yeah definitely the latest you’ve stayed up haha
3/6/20 4:20 - Joe: 😂 
You should’ve taken the “never mind” and gone to bed.
3/6/20 4:21 - Joe: Hahaha ok I’m going to shut up now
3/6/20 4:22 - Lorena: Jajaja no podía ser así, yo te acababa de decir que no tenía ganas de conocer a otros y vos blablabla no quiero hacerte daño no te lo tomes a mal y yo pensando, que? 🙊👊
3/6/20 4:25 - Joe: Haha and me blahblahblah?? Damn I’m lame as fuck
3/6/20 4:26 - Joe: You probably thought I was saying I don’t want to meet you or something haha. Damn I bet all that sounded so weird when you read it
3/6/20 4:26 - Joe: Don’t get confused. I want to meet you and I’ll be very direct about it if that changes.
3/6/20 4:26 - Joe: But it won’t haha
3/6/20 4:27 - Lorena: Jajajaja
3/6/20 4:30 - Lorena: Si algo así, pensé... mierda para que habré contado esto, se suponía que debía ser positivo para el y no darle pena el otro...ahora está asustado y yo no entiendo lo que me dice el puto traductor  jaja
3/6/20 4:31 - Lorena: Fue culpa mía también por no entender bien jaja, te tocó explicármelo más, pobre pinochito!
3/6/20 4:32 - Joe: 😂 aaah I can only imagine what was going through your mind. That’s pretty funny hahah
3/6/20 4:33 - Lorena: Jajaja 😬 y vos querías mandarme a la cama antes
3/6/20 4:33 - Joe: No big deal for me but it ended up keeping you awake for 2 more hours
3/6/20 4:34 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️
3/6/20 4:34 - Joe: I want you to get good sleep that’s all Hahahaha
3/6/20 4:35 - Joe: Now I kept you up all night
3/6/20 4:35 - Lorena: Jajaja todo bien, tampoco es tan grave
3/6/20 4:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

3/6/20 5:48 - Lorena: Me pondría encima de vos, e iria dándote más besos por el pecho y barriga
3/6/20 5:48 - Lorena: Y luego tocaría suavemente ese short azul
3/6/20 5:49 - Joe: Mmmmm fuck
3/6/20 5:50 - Lorena: Te quitaría el pantalón para que te quedes desnudo, y luego me quitaría yo toda la ropa también. Los dos sin nada, solo el contacto de la piel .. la respiración..

3/6/20 6:13 - Joe: 😮 oooh I’ll have to make some request in that case
3/6/20 6:14 - Joe: Not sure what to request though so maybe next time haha

3/6/20 6:15 - Joe: Hahah I had a lot of fun talking to you today and I’m glad we “explored” a little more.
3/6/20 6:15 - Joe: Sleep well babe. I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
3/6/20 6:16 - Lorena: Buenas noches liiindo, 😘
3/6/20 21:03 - Joe: I just saw a mosquito in my room! I tried to kill it but I missed and now I can’t see it. Little fucker has probably been biting me for days!
3/6/20 21:18 - Lorena: Buenos días!!!
3/6/20 21:18 - Lorena: Jaja sí como a mí ayer también
3/6/20 21:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 21:19 - Lorena: Que tal dormiste?
3/6/20 21:26 - Joe: Haha yeah mosquito are terrible. That’s why I like those carnivorous plants. Nature’s mosquito trap haha
3/6/20 21:27 - Joe: I sleep pretty good. Didn’t fall asleep on the couch so that probably helped.
3/6/20 21:28 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/6/20 23:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 23:46 - Joe: Oooh it was good. I didn’t take many notes today. Just listened to Nelly talk about when she moved to the US in the 60s. Interesting stuff haha
3/6/20 23:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/6/20 23:50 - Lorena: Jaja a ver
4/6/20 0:09 - Joe: Haha yeah this was me today. All kinds of stuff about not speaking English, having to sit in the back of the bus, crazy neighbors
4/6/20 0:09 - Joe: Good stuff
4/6/20 0:10 - Lorena: 😮
4/6/20 0:11 - Lorena: Y ella te contó la historia en español?
4/6/20 0:18 - Joe: Yeah she tells me everything in spanish but when I don’t understand she can explain in English
4/6/20 0:19 - Lorena: Contamelo en español entonces jjj
4/6/20 0:23 - Joe: Hmmm what to tell you 🤔
4/6/20 0:26 - Joe: Hahah I really don’t know what to tell you in spanish cause I didn’t write much down. I have a hard enough time translating it in my head. I can remember what she said but in my head it’s in english. I couldn’t tell you the exact phrases in Spanish unless I use the translator 🤦‍♂️
4/6/20 0:27 - Lorena: Jaja bueno no pasa nada, no te preocupes
4/6/20 0:27 - Joe: I still don’t hear or understand every word so I can only piece together the idea of what is being said.
4/6/20 0:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 0:29 - Lorena: Jaja es normal, poco a poco. Tranqui jjj
4/6/20 0:31 - Joe: Haha for sure. I’ll get it down
4/6/20 0:32 - Joe: So what time did you wake up today? You stayed up helllla late haha. Sun was probably coming up as you went to sleep
4/6/20 0:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 0:55 - Lorena: Jajaj mierda que sombra en mi cara 🙈👻
4/6/20 1:05 - Joe: Haha I had to listen so many times! You didn’t nap?? I would have haha
4/6/20 1:05 - Joe: You should send videos or audio to me everyday until I don’t have to listen multiple times to understand hahah.
4/6/20 1:12 - Lorena: Jaja
4/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: Te decía que.. "si, me acosté super tarde y me desperté a las 9 de la mañana. Rogel el perro de mi amiga estaba llorando en mi puerta. Después vino otra amiga Carol y desayunamos café y tostadas. Después me puse con el curso de 3d y no dormí siesta, por último me di una ducha relajante y acá estoy"
4/6/20 1:18 - Joe: Haha I appreciate the subtitles. I understood the ideas like waking at 9, the dog crying at the door, coffee and toast with your friends for breakfast, 3d course, no nap and shower haha
4/6/20 1:19 - Joe: I miss a bunch in between and I don’t hear a lot of the words but I kind of know what you say. Good to be able to read it so I can catch all the words
4/6/20 1:21 - Lorena: Jaja sí hablé lo más lento posible, ahora que estoy relajada
4/6/20 1:23 - Joe: Yeah we’ll wait until I’m a little better at spanish before you send the videos after drinking coffee
4/6/20 1:24 - Joe: Oh god I can only imagine what it sounds like when you talk really fast. Blahblahblahblah I wouldn’t understand shit
4/6/20 1:25 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🙈
4/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Intentaré hablarte lo más lento posible para que puedas entenderme
4/6/20 1:28 - Joe: If you spoke English it would be so easy for me to learn from you hahah. I feel like I can understand Nelly waaaaay better after a few weeks of talking almost everyday
4/6/20 1:30 - Lorena: Jjj 🤷
4/6/20 1:30 - Joe: Now I really have to expand my vocabulary, because I’ll end up understanding most of a sentence but not knowing one or two words throws me off haha.  But I’m finally started to understand the basic rules I better
4/6/20 1:32 - Lorena: Jaja bueno el vocabulario es más fácil, solo nos preguntas o lo buscas y ya esta 😊
4/6/20 1:37 - Joe: Sí, definitivamente es más fácil pero hay tantas palabras jaja
4/6/20 1:38 - Joe: Nunca termina
4/6/20 1:39 - Lorena: Poco a poco, lo conseguirás!
4/6/20 1:40 - Lorena: Bueno, me voy a dormiir
4/6/20 1:41 - Joe: Oook. Get more than 3 hours of sleep today haha. Sleep well babe. Buenas noches
4/6/20 1:41 - Lorena: Que tengas buena tarde ☺️😘
4/6/20 1:41 - Joe: 😘

4/6/20 8:11 - Joe: Hahaha you definitely got me for a second. I was like what the hell is she doing. And it was so dark and hard to see.
4/6/20 8:12 - Joe: Mmmm I’m going to take the dogs place haha so jealous

4/6/20 11:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 11:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 14:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 14:11 - Joe: Thanks for the videos haha
4/6/20 14:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 14:22 - Lorena: Jajaj del sofá a la cama, buenas noches!
4/6/20 19:44 - Joe: I had a dream last night I was living with some people I didn’t know and they spoke spanish 😂 that was the first time anyone has spoke Spanish in my dream. So weird
4/6/20 19:54 - Lorena: Buenos días rulitos, que dormido estabas eh jaja chinito
4/6/20 19:55 - Lorena: Síii? Jajaja
4/6/20 19:55 - Lorena: Contame!
4/6/20 19:56 - Lorena: Que decían, vos hablabas también?
4/6/20 19:57 - Joe: All I remember for sure was they asked if I wanted to eat hahaha there was more but I can’t remember. I also don’t remember if I said anything
4/6/20 19:58 - Joe: Damn it was so much clearer when I first woke up haha I should’ve just put as much detail as I could in that first message.
4/6/20 19:58 - Joe: “Quieres comer algo?” Haha
4/6/20 19:59 - Joe: That’s all I can remember
4/6/20 20:02 - Lorena: jajajajaç
4/6/20 20:04 - Lorena: que gracioso, si por eso te pregunté rápido.. a mi me pasa que sueño o tengo alguna pesadilla, y si la cuento tarde, ya no tiene tanto sentido jaja
4/6/20 20:05 - Lorena: el español se esta metiendo hasta en tus sueños!
4/6/20 20:09 - Joe: Hopefully spanish in my dreams is a good sign that I’m picking it up.
4/6/20 20:09 - Joe: It was so weird though. I was living with some family I didn’t know
4/6/20 20:09 - Joe: Damn
4/6/20 20:09 - Joe: I thought it was coming back to me ahaha
4/6/20 20:11 - Joe: Hhmmm there was an older lady, and a younger man 🤔 she was at a table, the room was small and kind of dark, didn’t feel like a house you find in the US
4/6/20 20:12 - Joe: Shit that’s all I got. I’m going to write it down next time right when I wake up if it happens again.
4/6/20 20:12 - Lorena: jajajaja
4/6/20 20:13 - Lorena: booludo, no tiene muy buena pinta ese sueño y ese lugar
4/6/20 20:14 - Lorena: por lo menos te ofrecían comida! jjj
4/6/20 20:14 - Lorena: mierda, en un sitio en español y yo no estaba allí!
4/6/20 20:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 20:16 - Joe: Hahaha I’ve had a dream about you I just didn’t tell you 🙊🙈
4/6/20 20:18 - Lorena: 😯😯
4/6/20 20:18 - Lorena: por quee? jaja contamelo ya!!!
4/6/20 20:19 - Lorena: espero que no sea malo 🙉
4/6/20 20:21 - Joe: Haha no it wasn’t bad. I can barely remember anything that happened in the dream now cause that was about a week ago. All I really remember is we were together. It was a good dream
4/6/20 20:23 - Lorena: ohhh, me lo tendrías que haber contado!!! buuu
4/6/20 20:24 - Lorena: pero me alegro mucho que lo hagas una semana después jaja y que estuviesemos juntos!
4/6/20 20:26 - Joe: Haha I didn’t want to seem weird and message you all excited that I had a dream about you 😂
4/6/20 20:28 - Lorena: joder Joe, raro sería si no te hiciese caso... jaja obviamente si es alguien que no me interesa, me daría exactamente igual que sueñe conmigo
4/6/20 20:29 - Lorena: pero de vos no! todo lo contrario!
4/6/20 20:31 - Joe: Alright well if I have another dream and you’re in it, I’ll let you know haha
4/6/20 20:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 20:34 - Lorena: vaya fumada llevo, me encanta la música
4/6/20 20:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 20:38 - Lorena: jaja es todo lo contrario, la noche y el día,e l sol y la lluvia
4/6/20 20:39 - Joe: Hahah true
4/6/20 20:40 - Joe: It’s so weird how we live in such different places. You’re so fucking far 😂
4/6/20 20:41 - Joe: I still don’t believe it sometimes how far you are. Never would I have imagined being in this situation
4/6/20 20:42 - Lorena: jaja yo tampoco, no lo hubiese imaginado para nada y me cuesta creer como pasó
4/6/20 20:44 - Lorena: principalmente, porque cuando te encontré y me respondiste, y empezamos a hablar, en mi cabeza estaba clarísimo que nunca te conocería ... y ahora.. pff jaja lo que más quiero es conocerte, me da igual donde sea ya
4/6/20 20:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 20:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 20:50 - Lorena: jaja dónde?
4/6/20 20:50 - Lorena: sabés lo que pensé yo?
4/6/20 20:51 - Joe: Haha I don’t know where these places are but they look nice
4/6/20 20:52 - Joe: What?
4/6/20 20:53 - Lorena: yo pensé en los sitios que más nos gustan, pero depende la fecha
4/6/20 20:54 - Lorena: pero más que un sitio exacto, pensé que si hacemos un viaje podríamos alquilar una furgoneta para dormir, o una autocaravana
4/6/20 20:54 - Lorena: jaja no sé, solo me gustó la idea de no encerrarnos en un hotel o en una casa
4/6/20 20:55 - Joe: Haha that sounds fun to me.
4/6/20 20:56 - Joe: Tell me all the ideas you come up with.
4/6/20 20:56 - Lorena: dormiste alguna vez en una furgo? es genial, podés aparcar donde quieras y despertarte con buenas vistas! cocinar algo simple, etc
4/6/20 20:57 - Joe: I mean I’m down to try it out. I have a friend that lives in a van with his dog and has a YouTube channel hahaha
4/6/20 20:58 - Lorena: sii? jaja me cae bien tu amigo entonces!
4/6/20 20:58 - Joe: No I haven’t. I wanted to try it for a while but I never did. 

In the end i decided if I’m going to live like that I’d build one of those tiny houses on wheels
4/6/20 20:59 - Joe: But with you I’d be fine with trying it in a van or motor home Haha keep it simple
4/6/20 21:02 - Joe: Van or motor home is way better for actually moving around often but I always wanted to build something like the houses on this page. 

If you end up not talking to be and I become an old single dude I’ll build one for myself and go live off grid hahah

4/6/20 21:04 - Joe: One more 

https://instagram.com/californiatinyhouse?igshid=c93u3dskec3h
4/6/20 21:04 - Lorena: jajaja si, ví varios proyectos de tiny houses! un profesor hacía diseños y siempre me mostraba jaja
4/6/20 21:05 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/B7g4-hOBW2N/
4/6/20 21:05 - Lorena: esta de la página que me acabas de pasar... aaaarg!
4/6/20 21:07 - Joe: I love how some of the designs look. Like full size house shrunk down
4/6/20 21:08 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/CAMJeQZndnY/
4/6/20 21:08 - Lorena: y mira esta que bonitaa, además tiene jardin para huerto, etc
4/6/20 21:08 - Joe: I did a lot of research on building a super tiny house haha. It’s so cool cause you can spend money on really high quality material since you don’t need as much material to build small.
4/6/20 21:09 - Joe: Probably cost between $40,000-60,000 to build a really nice tiny house
4/6/20 21:10 - Joe: Ooh that one is nice. The hardest part is finding land to park your house on but damn I hella want one 😂
4/6/20 21:10 - Lorena: claro!!! lo único depende de donde este por el clima, tema de aislamiento y demás! pero son geniales
4/6/20 21:11 - Lorena: jajaja me encanta que nos guste lo mismo!
4/6/20 21:11 - Lorena: la marihuana me esta haciendo imaginar que vivimos en unaaa, con un huerto y perros
4/6/20 21:12 - Lorena: puedo aprender a diseñar webs y vos las desarrollas jaja, sumado a nuestro canal de Youtube jajaja
4/6/20 21:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:13 - Joe: Hahah if we built a tiny house and lived in the middle of nowhere with some dogs our YouTube channel would be great
4/6/20 21:14 - Lorena: pero nuestra vida mucho mejor! jajaja
4/6/20 21:14 - Joe: Hahahah so embarrassing but I was definitely going to film the process of building the house and make a channel about the house
4/6/20 21:15 - Joe: Hahah yes. It would be perfect
4/6/20 21:15 - Lorena: jajaja auténtico influencer de Youtube
4/6/20 21:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:16 - Joe: Hahahahaha
4/6/20 21:17 - Joe: Shit
4/6/20 21:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:18 - Lorena: jajajjaa te intento "picar"/ "molestarte" sé que no sos así...
4/6/20 21:20 - Joe: Hahah you try to “push my buttons” 😂 I’m pretty sure I told you that before.
4/6/20 21:20 - Lorena: creo que una plataforma como Youtube es genial, se pueden ver muchísimos videos de gente que tiene pensamientos interesantes o que construye cosas así, y su intención es solo compartirlo.. muy diferente a la parte negra de Youtube, de gente superficial, egocéntrica que quiere likes o dicen cosas sin sentido
4/6/20 21:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:20 - Lorena: jajajaja
4/6/20 21:22 - Lorena: jajaja siempre, me divierteeee ... jaja a mis amigas siempre que puedo las pico con algo!
4/6/20 21:22 - Joe: Very true. That’s why I like YouTube. For almost every topic you can find people sharing information just because they want to share it.
4/6/20 21:23 - Lorena: siiim luego hay chicos que suben videos de skate, enseñando como poner una lija... o explican algo sentados en el suelo, mientras vuelan una botella de agua jajajaja
4/6/20 21:24 - Joe: Hahaha still roasting me 😂
4/6/20 21:26 - Joe: I have fun making videos so it’s whatever. It’s always a little bit embarrassing when people find them but it’s just me doing things I like to do and saying things I know so it shouldn’t be a big deal.
4/6/20 21:27 - Joe: For me that is. It shouldn’t be a big deal for me
4/6/20 21:28 - Joe: But you can poke fun. I enjoy your button pushing. I’m just saying, making stuff like that is weird in the way that you put yourself out there for people to judge you
4/6/20 21:29 - Lorena: eyyyy es solo una broma!
4/6/20 21:29 - Joe: Hahah I know i know
4/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: no es para burlarme de vos negativamente.. ni mucho menos
4/6/20 21:30 - Joe: No biggie
4/6/20 21:31 - Lorena: si te dije que me gustaban, son caseros y naturales.. de todos modos, es verdad.. cuando publicas algo te expones a que la gente opine, de manera positiva o negativa
4/6/20 21:31 - Joe: Haha don’t worry I know. I’m just saying what I’m thinking. I don’t take it negatively from you at all. I know you like them and you joke with me in a caring and fun way.
4/6/20 21:31 - Lorena: hay a chicas que les encanta una chica explicando durante 1 hora un maquillaje, yo la critico.. aunque intento no cruzarme con esos videos jajaja
4/6/20 21:35 - Joe: I’m just glad you’re not a girl that is obsessed with those kind of videos haha
4/6/20 21:36 - Joe: I watch so much random shit I can’t judge what other people watch though 🤷‍♂️
4/6/20 21:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

4/6/20 21:41 - Joe: I love these pictures
4/6/20 21:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:42 - Joe: Hahah cute
4/6/20 21:42 - Joe: This is a cool place to wash dishes
4/6/20 21:44 - Joe: You’re such a little hippie girl hahah It’s great
4/6/20 21:46 - Lorena: jajaja ❤️
4/6/20 21:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:51 - Joe: Aw hella cute. You and the dog haha
4/6/20 21:53 - Joe: Dogs and beer. Two of the most frequent things in your photos hahah
4/6/20 21:55 - Lorena: jajaja mierdaa
4/6/20 21:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 21:59 - Joe: You read that beer has lots of benefits? Hahah nice.
4/6/20 22:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 22:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 22:00 - Lorena: mira además justo encontré una foto que sale un oso, jajaja "chela" se dice a la cerveza también
4/6/20 22:01 - Lorena: jajajaj 😒
4/6/20 22:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 22:03 - Joe: Hahah I’ll look over these benefits
4/6/20 22:03 - Joe: Beer treats dandruff!? What the hell? Hahaha
4/6/20 22:03 - Lorena: jajajajajaja
4/6/20 22:04 - Lorena: ya lo sabes! buenísima! jajaja
4/6/20 22:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 22:08 - Joe: I wish pancakes had health benefits 🥞
4/6/20 22:17 - Lorena: Jajajaja
4/6/20 22:17 - Lorena: Podés comer un paqueque con esta cerveza que si los tiene
4/6/20 22:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 22:24 - Joe: Hahah beer and pancakes? Weird 😂
4/6/20 22:25 - Lorena: Jaja una delicia
4/6/20 22:57 - Joe: I’ll have to try it sometime. I have literally never heard of such a thing
4/6/20 23:10 - Lorena: Yo tomo cerveza con choco también jaja
4/6/20 23:18 - Joe: Hahah damn you really enjoy your beer 😂 that’s cool though. All these things sound strange to me but if you like it, I won’t judge haha
4/6/20 23:19 - Joe: I never would’ve thought to try those combinations haha
4/6/20 23:20 - Lorena: Jaja boludo 🙈
4/6/20 23:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/6/20 23:21 - Lorena: Si me gusta, así soy.. jaja
4/6/20 23:22 - Lorena: La tomo cuando estoy cocinando, o tengo un día estresante o bien algo alegre , y mientras ceno me tomó una y luego como me queda un poco hay veces que el postre (algo de choco).. lo combino con lo último que me quedó de cerve
4/6/20 23:24 - Joe: Haha all good. If that’s what you like it’s fine with me.
4/6/20 23:26 - Joe: As long as you’re not as drunk as Tokyo in that one episode when Rio comes back. Hahaha i was watching it yesterday, super drunk spanish sounds hilarious
4/6/20 23:27 - Joe: I also realized the hardest character for me to understand is Denver. I don’t know why, maybe he just talks the fastest or something but can never understand him
5/6/20 0:54 - Lorena: 😊☺️😚
5/6/20 0:55 - Lorena: Jajaj nooo. Eh yo tomo cerveza en casa a diario pero sanamente, y luego si salgo también pero ahí un poquito más ... El punto de ,"contenta" no borracha!
5/6/20 0:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 1:02 - Lorena: Estas viendo la casa de papel otra vez?
5/6/20 1:04 - Joe: Hahah I believe you. I just would love to go out and spend some time with “content” you 😂
5/6/20 1:05 - Lorena: Mmm Denver si es más cerrado, el tiene como un acento "macarra, chico duro" mezcla como alguien de barrio cerrado
5/6/20 1:05 - Joe: Yeah I’m watching it again. I can understand more this time but what I do is I’ll watch it and if there is an interesting scene I watch it once with spanish subtitles to know what words they’re using, then again with English subtitles while listening for the words I read the first time. It’s a weird way to study haha
5/6/20 1:06 - Joe: I feel like the subtitles don’t match what he says a lot of the time. Or at least more often than the other characters
5/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Like he was in the bathroom and said he didn’t hear anything. Sounds like he says “escucho nada” but the subtitles were like “no .. ... oido”
5/6/20 1:08 - Lorena: Genial, estás currandotelo rulitos!
5/6/20 1:09 - Lorena: Ah sí??  Cualquier cosa que dudes, decimelo y te lo explico
5/6/20 1:10 - Lorena: 🤨🤔😂
5/6/20 1:14 - Lorena: Que raro, si ves esa parte u otra pásamela y te digo si es un error
5/6/20 1:15 - Joe: Hah I’m missing some filler words that the subtitles had but I listened to it so many times cause I was like, “no way he is saying that” haha
5/6/20 1:15 - Joe: Haha alright for sure I will
5/6/20 1:15 - Lorena: Mmmmmm
5/6/20 1:16 - Joe: I can never understand Denver though. It’s so weird.
5/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: Sisi pasamelas o cualquiera que quieras, estaré encantada en ayudarte
5/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: Si es que el habla muy rápido y cerrado
5/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: No vocaliza
5/6/20 1:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 1:19 - Lorena: Jajaja
5/6/20 1:25 - Lorena: Jooooooe
5/6/20 1:26 - Joe: Hahah what’s up babe?
5/6/20 1:26 - Lorena: Jaja que estoy pensando sitios
5/6/20 1:27 - Lorena: España tiene un montón de lugares lindos, y diferentes!
5/6/20 1:27 - Joe: Haha ok what do you have in mind?
5/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: El norte es pura naturaleza, aunque el clima es lluvioso pero por eso es tan verde
5/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Luego el sur hace mejor tiempo, hay playitas lindas y arquitectónicamente es lindo con influencia árabe
5/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Luego están las ciudades como Madrid y Barcelona
5/6/20 1:28 - Joe: Green is my favorite color haha and I love nature
5/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Y luego islas canarias e islas baleares
5/6/20 1:29 - Lorena: Todo esto en España
5/6/20 1:29 - Joe: South sounds interesting too haha
5/6/20 1:29 - Lorena: Luego cerca tenemos Portugal que es súper barato y lindo, y Marruecos!!!
5/6/20 1:30 - Joe: Hahaha you’re going to induce analysis paralysis with all these options 😂
5/6/20 1:31 - Joe: I can only stay for 90 days unless I apply for some kind of visa or something right? I’ll have to get all that figured out and we need to narrow down a plan haha shit is complicated

But Spain sounds cool to me. I’d be super down to move there for a while
5/6/20 1:35 - Lorena: jajaja es que tuve antes paralisis de análisis durante la cena y mis compañeras me ayudaron
5/6/20 1:36 - Lorena: jajaja 🤭
5/6/20 1:38 - Lorena: mientras estaba tomando una cerveza dije que igual podía irme a California, Hawaii, Peru, Costa Rica, Indonesia, etc.. jajaja y ellas me aconsejaron todos los sitios buenos que hay en España, Portugal, Italia, Marruecos, etc...
5/6/20 1:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 1:40 - Joe: 😂
5/6/20 1:42 - Joe: So many options haha maybe instead of picking just one you can make a list and we can live in each place until we find our favorite haha
5/6/20 1:43 - Lorena: jajaja Joeee, te estoy hablando en serio!
5/6/20 1:44 - Lorena: vivir en todas es imposible jaja, escucha pero a vos que te gustaría?
5/6/20 1:46 - Lorena: yo en Madrid ahora estoy trabajando.. y estaré un tiempo más por la casa.. aunque podría tener unos 20 días de vacaciones si sigo en el mismo trabajo
5/6/20 1:50 - Joe: Is it impossible? I mean...we’re not THAT old haha and it’s not like we have to spend 10 years in each place or anything. Few years here few years there you know?
5/6/20 1:50 - Joe: In the future hahah
5/6/20 1:51 - Joe: But for now I don’t know, whatever works for you. I’ll go wherever
5/6/20 1:51 - Joe: Doesn’t matter too much to me where I am
5/6/20 1:52 - Joe: Spain sounds cool and like it has a wide variety of places. But whatever we can make work is where I’m going haha
5/6/20 1:54 - Joe: You pick the place and I’ll just meet you there
5/6/20 1:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 1:57 - Joe: Hahaha shit
5/6/20 1:58 - Lorena: Si, suena genial lo de vivir en varios sitios, jaja pero entonces vas a venir? algún sitio tendrás interés en conocer no?
5/6/20 1:59 - Lorena: ajjaja no podés dejarme elegir solo a mi, después de haberme enseñado ese video, jajaja
5/6/20 2:00 - Lorena: vas a venir a España entonces de vacaciones? podemos ir a esos sitios en una furgo o a las islas, los vuelos son baratos.. fuera de temporada igual unos 50eu ida y vuelta
5/6/20 2:01 - Lorena: okey, me callo.. jaja
5/6/20 2:02 - Lorena: cuando empiezo con el analisis y las preguntas no puedo parar jajaja
5/6/20 2:02 - Joe: Haha don’t shut up
5/6/20 2:02 - Joe: It’s all good
5/6/20 2:04 - Joe: Hmm it’s hard to describe but i really don’t mind too much the location as long as I have the necessities. And it would matter even less if I was with you.
5/6/20 2:04 - Joe: If the place is new to me it’s an adventure either way and I want to know all different kinds of places in the world
5/6/20 2:06 - Lorena: jaja me encanta lo "loco" que estas
5/6/20 2:07 - Lorena: bueno, si finalmente llegas a venir... te intentaré llevar a sitios diferentes, y pondré en la lista varios skateparks de camino
5/6/20 2:07 - Lorena: Barcelona me habias dicho que si querías conocer
5/6/20 2:10 - Joe: Haha sweeeet. You’ll be my tour guide 😂
5/6/20 2:11 - Joe: I’ll be back in California in a few days and then I can actually start the process of getting everything setup to go
5/6/20 2:15 - Lorena: 😊😊😊
5/6/20 2:17 - Lorena: Geniaal!
5/6/20 2:19 - Lorena: intentaré no ilusionarme demasiado por si no lo haces finalmente jaja
5/6/20 2:20 - Lorena: tu familia que va a decir, que viajas a europa por primera vez?
5/6/20 2:22 - Joe: I better make it there haha shit. 

I don’t know what my family will say. I’m sure they’ll be excited
5/6/20 2:24 - Lorena: jaja eso es bueno!
5/6/20 2:34 - Joe: So no one has told you it’s a bad idea to meet me yet? Your brother must know about me, cause I saw him look at my Instagram story one time 😂 

What does he say?
5/6/20 2:38 - Lorena: de verdadddd?
5/6/20 2:39 - Lorena: tu hermano también el mio! jjjj
5/6/20 2:39 - Joe: Haha whaaaat?
5/6/20 2:40 - Joe: Damn haha that’s funny
5/6/20 2:40 - Joe: Nosy brothers haha
5/6/20 2:42 - Lorena: jajaja sii, fue cuando puse eso del juego, el entro a ver las stories jjjjj
5/6/20 2:43 - Joe: Yeah that’s when he saw mine. They couldn’t help themselves
5/6/20 2:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 2:44 - Lorena: jajajaja muy gracioso
5/6/20 2:44 - Lorena: me dan ganas de volver a ponerles una trampa
5/6/20 2:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 2:45 - Joe: I wonder what they thought when they look at our pages haha
5/6/20 2:47 - Lorena: jajaja ahora entiendo todo
5/6/20 2:48 - Lorena: yo a mi madre le dije que estaba practicando inglés, pq tenía un nuevo amigo.. ella empezó a intentar sacar información y le terminé contando que estabas en Hawaii, pero que vivias en California y que tenías parte de familia peruana pero que no hablabas español ..solo eso recuerdo que le conté
5/6/20 2:51 - Joe: Haha you told your mom? What’d she say? She just wanted all the info and that’s it?
5/6/20 2:51 - Lorena: y el otro día cuando fui a la sierra, me hicieron una broma mi hermano y mi madre.. y me dijeron... eh ehhhh el equilibrio? jajaj y yo que?? y mi madre empezó a hacer un movimiento con los brazos de equilibrio como si patinase.. y dije.. como saben? no puede ser... jaja Gastón, vos estuviste mirando algo?? y me dijo no no lore, fue mamá... que dice que lo encontró por casualidad en tu perfil... jajaa hijo de puta... fue el!!!!
5/6/20 2:52 - Joe: Hahahaha
5/6/20 2:52 - Joe: 😂
5/6/20 2:52 - Lorena: si, mi madre sabe inglés.. pero yo no aproveché la oportunidad de aprenderlo.. por eso le conté que ahora si estaba leyendo inglés jajaja y ella quería saber más de la cuenta
5/6/20 2:55 - Joe: That’s cool. I told Nelly haha she was just like “oooh that’s nice” haha But I didn’t tell her much except that “I have a friend that lives in Spain that I talk to and she only speaks Spanish”
5/6/20 2:55 - Joe: The rest of my family can find out when I have my plans to visit you more figured out
5/6/20 2:56 - Joe: Now I want to know what my brother thinks haha shit
5/6/20 2:56 - Lorena: jaja si vos sos más reservado que yo, a mi se me escapa y lo termino contando...
5/6/20 2:57 - Lorena: tenés que contarle a Nelly la historia, necesitamos saber su opinión jajaja
5/6/20 2:58 - Lorena: Tu hermano no sabía nada de nada no? el si que estará más confundido... jaja
5/6/20 2:59 - Joe: 😂 alright I’ll tell her and see what she says haha
5/6/20 3:00 - Joe: No he didn’t know anything haha. Probably looked at your page so confused.
5/6/20 3:00 - Joe: It’ll all make sense to him in the end haha
5/6/20 3:02 - Lorena: si, el podía mirar solo el perfil las fotos, pero fue más curioso y miró las stories también, el habrá pensado "una chica que habla español y vive muy lejos jugando al juego de mi hermano? mmm"
5/6/20 3:04 - Joe: Haha for real that’s the part that gets me. He was so curious he had to click the story 😂
5/6/20 3:12 - Lorena: jjj
5/6/20 3:12 - Lorena: que hacesss? mandame un video antes de dormirme! jaja
5/6/20 3:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 3:19 - Joe: I have to get my suitcase out so I can pack and I have to tidy up the room haha Buenas noches 😘
5/6/20 3:29 - Lorena: Gracias, jaja buena tarea hacer la maleta..estarás entretenido!  buena tarde para voss, yo me voy a dormir ya! 😘
5/6/20 21:00 - Joe: Holaaaaaa
5/6/20 21:00 - Joe: Only 3 more days left here 😢
5/6/20 21:07 - Lorena: Buenos días para vos!
5/6/20 21:07 - Lorena: Ohh, jaja qué tal ya tenés la maleta preparada?
5/6/20 21:18 - Joe: Almost. It’s mostly packed but I have a few things out to wear for the next few days.
5/6/20 21:19 - Joe: I found out I have some kind of training for the skate camp next week so I start work the day I get back instead of a week later. Throwing off all my plans haha
5/6/20 21:22 - Lorena: 👏
5/6/20 21:23 - Lorena: Nooo.. jaja que putada! El mismo día? Cuáles eran tus planes justo al volver?
5/6/20 21:26 - Joe: I was hoping to use my free time in the first week back to find a place to stay and start on my passport stuff
5/6/20 21:29 - Joe: I get back on Monday night around midnight and have to be at work Tuesday morning haha. Shit
5/6/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 21:42 - Lorena: Uhhh, jajaja los niños estarán deseando que vuelvas.. seguro que te lo pasas bien aunque estarás un poco cansado 😅
5/6/20 21:42 - Joe: Hahaha
5/6/20 21:43 - Joe: I wish haha. It’s for training so it’ll be super boring all day meetings
5/6/20 21:44 - Lorena: Jajaja pensamiento positivo
5/6/20 21:45 - Lorena: Te podrás agarrar una nueva tabla y mientras entrenan.. vos estrenas el nuevo patín jjjj
5/6/20 21:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 21:47 - Joe: Hahahahaha
5/6/20 21:50 - Joe: Haha hopefully I can find some time to go pick a new skateboard up. If not I can get it over the weekend
5/6/20 21:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:07 - Joe: Looks like it’s starting to get back to normal slowly. Lots of people.
5/6/20 22:07 - Joe: Haha what did you get for her?
5/6/20 22:16 - Lorena: Esto es nada para la gente que hay normalmente, pero después de estar acostumbrada a ver a poca, hoy ver a tanta me agobió un poco
5/6/20 22:16 - Lorena: Un vestido, un top, un jersey.. jaja ropa es lo que más le gusta. Pero tuve que hacer colas para entrar, menos mal que iba con música!
5/6/20 22:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:20 - Joe: 😂
5/6/20 22:21 - Joe: Ah yeah I guess I’ve never seen it at normal levels. But compared to when you first started going out, it’s pretty busy haha
5/6/20 22:21 - Joe: That’s nice of you. Yeah good thing you had the music with you haha.
5/6/20 22:22 - Joe: I’m trying to draw a new design for my portfolio but I can’t come up with any good ideas. I’m trying to do the mobile phone design first then I’ll make another for bigger screens.
5/6/20 22:23 - Lorena: A ver, enseñamelo,!
5/6/20 22:24 - Lorena: Te ayudo si puedo en algo!
5/6/20 22:26 - Joe: Hahaha nooooo not yet. I don’t even have anything yet. I just started and I can’t draw shit haha
5/6/20 22:27 - Lorena: Jaja yo ya me lo imagino
5/6/20 22:27 - Lorena: 🙄
5/6/20 22:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:30 - Joe: Super simple sketches first then I’ll probably try to make it in a program like Adobe XD before coding it up. Going to go through the whole process this time haha. I kind of just went straight to coding the last version, that’s probably why it sucks haha
5/6/20 22:31 - Joe: I suck at designing stuff haha fuck
5/6/20 22:32 - Joe: My brain just loves to come up with ugly stuff haha
5/6/20 22:32 - Lorena: Jaja
5/6/20 22:32 - Lorena: Bueno recién empezaste a pensarlo
5/6/20 22:33 - Lorena: Me dejas ayudarte? Jaja
5/6/20 22:34 - Joe: Haha totally! I welcome your help.
5/6/20 22:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:41 - Joe: Siempre con un cerveza jaja 🍻
5/6/20 22:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
5/6/20 22:51 - Lorena: Jaja tenia tantas ganas
5/6/20 22:53 - Lorena: Cenaré con Sandrii ahora luego te escribooo 😘
5/6/20 23:02 - Joe: Oook enjoy your dinner!
6/6/20 0:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 1:03 - Lorena: Jajaja avanzaste!
6/6/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jaja el final ñaaaa jajaj como el chino d ronronear jajaja
6/6/20 1:06 - Joe: Hahaha dammit 😂
6/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Yeah I got a little bit done. I don’t know if I like it. Probably should draw another. Then I need to draw what it would look like on a bigger screen before I make the prototype in Adobe XD or figma.
6/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Este mensaje fue eliminado
6/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Hahahah whoops
6/6/20 1:08 - Lorena: Que eliminaste?
6/6/20 1:12 - Joe: Hahaha audio clip
6/6/20 1:16 - Lorena: 👂
6/6/20 1:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 1:20 - Lorena: Jajaja eso suena a francés
6/6/20 1:20 - Lorena: Ronronieeer
6/6/20 1:20 - Lorena: Jijjjj
6/6/20 1:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 1:21 - Lorena: Jjjj
6/6/20 1:21 - Lorena: Estoy viendo el video
6/6/20 1:24 - Joe: The one of my crappy sketch? Its terrible haha. I should practice sketching designs more often
6/6/20 1:29 - Lorena: jaja si, estoy pensando
6/6/20 1:29 - Lorena: noo, esta bien! se entiende, esta todo ordenadito jjj
6/6/20 1:35 - Joe: It’s a start haha. This will be the third time I try to design my portfolio. The one I showed you was version 2.
6/6/20 1:36 - Joe: jmvcode.com

This was the original one I made which I also hate hahaha
6/6/20 1:38 - Lorena: mejor el violeta, este primero no me gusta mucho jaja 🙊🙈
6/6/20 1:39 - Joe: Don’t worry I hate the first one so much. I don’t even know why I made it like that haha. But that’s why I made the second one
6/6/20 1:41 - Lorena: jaja los primeros son los peores, pero siempre se van cambiando cosas para mejorar, lo ves con otro ojo..
6/6/20 1:43 - Joe: Yeah it’s an iterative process
6/6/20 1:44 - Joe: Just have to keep trying different things until I get an idea of what works and what doesn’t
6/6/20 2:04 - Lorena: mmmmmmm
6/6/20 2:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 2:15 - Joe: Hahahah 😂 aaah
6/6/20 2:15 - Joe: What’re you doing???
6/6/20 2:15 - Lorena: jaja
6/6/20 2:15 - Lorena: estaba mirando como quedaba una cosa
6/6/20 2:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 2:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 2:35 - Lorena: Nada.. simplemente estaba dandole una vuelta por arriba probando jaja
6/6/20 2:42 - Joe: You’re the fucking best!! Hahaha
6/6/20 2:42 - Joe: Damn
6/6/20 2:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 2:43 - Joe: You’re good at that. Not even using the right tools and still make a nice looking design haha
6/6/20 2:44 - Joe: I would love to see what you could make if you used actual UO design tools
6/6/20 2:44 - Lorena: nahhh.. no se, solo estoy probando con lo que sé que es photoshop jaja
6/6/20 2:45 - Joe: Haha oh for sure I’m just saying, your stuff looks good and without the right tool so it’d probably look fairly professional if you ever use the other tools in the future
6/6/20 2:46 - Joe: But you did a pretty good job haha way better than me. Thank youuu
6/6/20 2:46 - Lorena: hacemos equipo futuro marido? jajaja
6/6/20 2:48 - Lorena: la ipografía que elegí es una finita, minimal.. se llama Corbel .. queda bien en light y a lo mejor en bold, Hi y Joe
6/6/20 2:48 - Joe: Hahah siiii
6/6/20 2:48 - Lorena: *tipografía
6/6/20 2:49 - Joe: Alright cool. I’ll use that font
6/6/20 2:50 - Lorena: creo que tanto la descripción, como tenías en tu portfolio, hola, soy Joe, bienvenido.. y la foto con la gorra si la pones en blanc y negros. estas dos cosas, podrían quedar más informales pero simpáticas
6/6/20 2:51 - Lorena: luego abajo, se puede separar con recuadros, a lo mejor se puede poner solo 3 y contacto con estética diferente ... o quitar stacks y añadirlo en about me al final con los iconos
6/6/20 2:52 - Lorena: luego un detallito a la derecha, con recuadro blanco y letra negra como home.. podría quedar más completo
6/6/20 2:53 - Lorena: mmm no sé
6/6/20 2:54 - Joe: Haha thanks design master
6/6/20 2:54 - Joe: So many tips
6/6/20 2:54 - Joe: I like the idea of removing the stack section and adding it to the about me
6/6/20 2:55 - Joe: Black and white is probably a good idea too and I’ll take a picture with another hat soon haha
6/6/20 2:56 - Lorena: jjajaja 🙈
6/6/20 2:56 - Lorena: decime más que se te ocurran y podemos ir probandolo con photoshop
6/6/20 2:57 - Lorena: jajaja math
6/6/20 2:57 - Joe: Haha no math for the next photo
6/6/20 2:58 - Joe: Alright I’ll let you know if I think of any other ideas.
6/6/20 2:58 - Lorena: esa es mi foto preferida jaja
6/6/20 2:59 - Joe: Haha the math one? That’s good to know 😂
6/6/20 2:59 - Joe: I like that hat 🧢
6/6/20 3:00 - Joe: But like you said, the hat is political so not great for a portfolio haha
6/6/20 3:04 - Lorena: si, en esto coincido con lo que me contaste
6/6/20 3:04 - Lorena: no no, politica para portfolio no es buena idea
6/6/20 3:05 - Lorena: decía foto preferida la que puse en la cascada
6/6/20 3:05 - Lorena: jaja esa foto fue por la que te hablé
6/6/20 3:08 - Joe: Hahaha
6/6/20 3:08 - Joe: You talked to me thanks to my dude Andrew Yang 😂
6/6/20 3:13 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
6/6/20 3:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 3:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 3:15 - Lorena: nooo, jaja por la otra fotoo! la de la cascada!!
6/6/20 3:16 - Joe: Oooh hahah that one is good too
6/6/20 3:16 - Joe: Siiiick
6/6/20 3:16 - Joe: That looks really good
6/6/20 3:17 - Lorena: jaja si no te gusta podés decirlo ehh
6/6/20 3:17 - Lorena: no te sientas presionado, jaja solo voy probando
6/6/20 3:17 - Joe: I like it
6/6/20 3:17 - Joe: Me gusta mucho or something haha
6/6/20 3:18 - Joe: Well it’s definitely better than what I was thinking of
6/6/20 3:18 - Joe: Looks professional
6/6/20 3:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 3:22 - Lorena: jajaja con todas las capas desordenadas, me pregunto como será ese programa de diseño
6/6/20 3:23 - Joe: From what I remember...much easier than that hahaa that looks complicated
6/6/20 3:24 - Joe: Or like a lot of unnecessary layers compared to how you build them with Adobe XD or Figma
6/6/20 3:25 - Lorena: 😬😬
6/6/20 3:25 - Lorena: jaja bueno, ya lo cerré por que si no, yo no voy a parar de retocarlo jaja
6/6/20 3:26 - Lorena: lo guardé por si algun día querés que le demos un poco más de forma
6/6/20 3:27 - Joe: Haha thank you I really appreciate the work you put into that. Another design for your web design portfolio 💼
6/6/20 3:28 - Lorena: de nada rulitos!
6/6/20 3:31 - Joe: Your sleep schedule is crazy right now haha you better get back on track before going back to work
6/6/20 3:32 - Joe: Staying up late and helping me with my portfolio design is hella sweet though 😘
6/6/20 3:37 - Lorena: jaja si, normalmente me acostaba a las 12, pero con la cuarentena mi horario cada vez era más tarde, y ya cuando te conocía  vos, se fue a la mierda jajaja
6/6/20 3:38 - Lorena: pero bueno, aún no estoy trabajando... cuando lo este y no pueda quedarme hasta tarde supongo que me echaras algo de menos jaja
6/6/20 3:40 - Lorena: jj no estoy cansada, y hace días dije que te iba a ayudar...tuve un momento de creatividad aunque sea tarde... jaja
6/6/20 3:43 - Joe: Yeah it’s going to be weird figuring out our new schedules haha
6/6/20 3:44 - Joe: And getting used to talking at different times
6/6/20 3:47 - Lorena: 🤷
6/6/20 3:47 - Joe: You’ll just slowly forget about me 😂
6/6/20 3:48 - Joe: Taaaarde 

Me pudri te olvidaste de mi
6/6/20 3:49 - Lorena: Jajajaja
6/6/20 3:51 - Lorena: No lo creo, auunque... si me insistis en que me olvidaré de vos y me mandas a dormir cada vez que es tarde... Mmm jaja no sé
6/6/20 3:55 - Joe: Hahah we might miss a few days of talking here and there but it’ll be hard to forget when I’m making my plans to meet you
6/6/20 3:55 - Joe: And I only tell you to sleep cause I feel bad keeping you up all night
6/6/20 3:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 4:01 - Lorena: jaja vale, no lo haré más!! esta la última 😊
6/6/20 4:02 - Joe: Mmmm....never mind haha
6/6/20 4:03 - Joe: Haha I can’t lie, even though I feel bad keeping you up I’ll miss talking to you as much as we do now.
6/6/20 4:04 - Lorena: no me lo explicas?
6/6/20 4:07 - Joe: I was trying to say there will probably be days we don’t talk because we’re too busy
6/6/20 4:08 - Joe: But that’s ok, I think it’s understood it’ll be a little more difficult. I’m still going to come visit you haha
6/6/20 4:11 - Lorena: Ahh ahora sí gracias
6/6/20 4:12 - Lorena: Si puede ser.. bueno me voy la cama! Un beso 😘
6/6/20 4:12 - Joe: Alright babe sleep well. Talk to you later. Buenas noches 😘
6/6/20 4:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 18:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/6/20 19:15 - Lorena: Jajaja
6/6/20 19:15 - Lorena: Hello funny boy!
6/6/20 19:26 - Joe: Aaaaah I need to do something today. Last weekend here. It’s all wet and cloudy and my skateboard is broken though 😞
6/6/20 19:33 - Lorena: It's okay to get out of the comfort zone ✌️cloudy days have their charm too, taaake a bike or walk.. and enjoy the time you hace left! ✨
6/6/20 19:34 - Lorena: *Have
6/6/20 19:40 - Joe: Yeaaah that’s true. I’m sure I’ll find something to do today

7/6/20 21:33 - Joe: Same same but different, as they say haha
7/6/20 21:33 - Joe: Now if we could actually be in the same place instead of same environment that’d be great.
7/6/20 21:50 - Lorena: Jaja

And skating in the cities is definitely more fun haha but I didn’t mind being without that too much.
7/6/20 22:45 - Joe: I’ll be looking forward to when I can get back to Hawaii. I’ll come back eventually. Need to do some more stuff first haha
7/6/20 22:46 - Lorena: Jaja por qué cosas no te dan ganas de volver?
7/6/20 22:47 - Lorena: Viendo tu Ig me imaginé que echarias muchísimo de menos patinar ahí , mmm bien, no sos un obsesionado jajaj
7/6/20 22:50 - Joe: I could still skate here so it wasn’t a big deal. Lots of stuff I like skating near by.

10/6/20 20:44 - Joe: Yeah I really love dogs I just can’t have one at the moment. I’ll have a couple of dogs eventually though.
10/6/20 20:45 - Joe: I forgot my wallet so I had to go get that before going. Good thing I went to my friends house first or I would have drove really far before noticing haha. But now I’m finally going to drive to the skate shop and get the board

10/6/20 23:12 - Joe: I didn’t understand what you were saying at first haha. But yeah the shop is pretty big. They actually own another store across the street that only sells shoes. And that blue house is actually a coffee shop with apartments above it haha

12/6/20 21:45 - Lorena: El se enfadaba por qué no podía elegir y a mí me hacía gracia jajaj por que sus opiniones nunca terminaban siendo las finales

13/6/20 6:42 - Lorena: Si ayer me olvidé y te escribí a tus 4AM, 🙈
13/6/20 6:43 - Lorena: Si, yo también..pero además del horario quería dejarte tiempo para estar en tu ciudad con tu gente, si hablabas conmigo no podías disfrutar tu llegada .. pero echo de menos hablar con vos 😭
13/6/20 6:44 - Joe: Don’t even worry about it. Message me anytime. I have my phone on silent at night too so it’s not a problem. I like to wake up to your messages
13/6/20 6:45 - Joe: Haha I miss talking with you too and I appreciate you thinking about my time since I just got back. I had fun spending time with my friends this week and start work next week.
13/6/20 6:47 - Lorena: Lo mismo digo! Yo también tengo el teléfono en silencio, si lo veo pronto es por qué me despierto al baño o no puedo dormir
13/6/20 6:47 - Lorena: 🥰
13/6/20 6:48 - Lorena: Seguiremos hablando con estos horarios?
13/6/20 6:49 - Lorena: Yo quiero seguir, ya no vas a venir a visitarme? 🥺
13/6/20 6:50 - Joe: Haha yeah we’re definitely going to talk. And I will still come to visit you. It’s just an adjustment to not have as much time to talk to you but I still think about you a lot throughout the day.
13/6/20 6:51 - Joe: I still love when you send little videos of yourself or photos haha
13/6/20 6:52 - Joe: But I’m here anytime you want to talk. About anything, if you have a bad day, good day, just woke up...message me whenever you have something to say.
13/6/20 6:56 - Lorena: Jaja okey podemos hacerlo!! Voy a intentar que así sea, yo también pienso en vos, de hecho soñé dos noches seguidas, aparecías en mis sueños 😂

13/6/20 18:29 - Joe: Hahaha good I’m glad you got more sleep. I felt a little bad keeping you up when I know you’d usually go back to sleep that early
13/6/20 19:00 - Lorena: Jajaja

14/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Y patinaron y luego hubo alguna concentración o algo?
14/6/20 0:54 - Joe: Yeah we ended at city hall and skated there for a while. I think the skate was about 6-7 miles so everyone was hella tired by the time we got to city hall
14/6/20 0:56 - Lorena: Uhh

14/6/20 7:00 - Joe: But his dogs are a little scared. They don’t like the fireworks
14/6/20 8:51 - Lorena: Es verdad
14/6/20 8:51 - Lorena: Estaba medio dormida
14/6/20 9:00 - Joe: Haha that’s ok. I don’t mind if you wait until the morning to respond to me. If you wake up in the night and check my message it’s totally chill if you wait to respond. I just wanted to send you videos. 

No pressure to respond when you’re half asleep haha
14/6/20 9:02 - Joe: I just got home 20 minutes ago but I’ll probably be falling asleep soon over here. Super tired and sore from a long day of skating.
14/6/20 9:04 - Lorena: Jaja yaa, hay veces que no me acuerdo lo que digo
14/6/20 9:04 - Lorena: Aunque hoy no sé por qué me desperté a las 6 y me costó dormir estaba mirando unas cosas de costa rica en Instagram 🙈
14/6/20 9:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 9:07 - Joe: Ooooh boy haha. Still dreaming of that island life
14/6/20 9:07 - Lorena: Jaja gracias por los videos, descansaaa, good night 😘

14/6/20 16:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 16:41 - Lorena: Jaja hubo telepatíaaa, te mandé este gif pero vos justo 5min antes le diste like a mi Ig, me acabo de dar cuenta
14/6/20 16:42 - Joe: Hahaha that always happens. I just got up a little while ago. I figured you were at work or something
14/6/20 16:44 - Lorena: Jaja y que haces despierto tan pronto?
14/6/20 16:45 - Lorena: Si estoy en el evento, muy tranquilo. Solo tres azafatas al lado, demasiado pesadasss blablabla con voz aguda 🤯
14/6/20 16:45 - Joe: Absolutely nothing. I’m getting hungry but I’m being too lazy to get up haha
14/6/20 16:46 - Joe: Haha that sounds unpleasant
14/6/20 16:47 - Lorena: Jajaja como yo esta noche
14/6/20 16:47 - Lorena: Si, no entiendo cómo son tan pesadas y hablan de cuando eran pequeñas y jugaban a las barbies
14/6/20 16:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 16:53 - Joe: Hahaha what the hell? That’s so weird 😂
14/6/20 16:54 - Joe: Now it sounds even more unpleasant than before. Good luck with that haha
14/6/20 16:57 - Lorena: Gracias Joeee
14/6/20 16:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 16:59 - Joe: Hah they’re loud. You need some headphone or ear plugs 😂
14/6/20 17:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 17:02 - Lorena: Jaja me encantaría tener un botón y ponerlas en mute
14/6/20 17:04 - Joe: You definitely need that. Is everyone in the same spot all day or do you move around the event at all?
14/6/20 17:05 - Lorena: Cada uno esta en su propio espacio, ya que vienen los visitantes y hay que explicar el diseño
14/6/20 17:06 - Lorena: Ellas se ponen ahí en una esquina por qué están aburridas, yo también. Pero sus conversaciones son muy aburridas
14/6/20 17:07 - Lorena: Preferiría hablar con un chico que está ahora en el otro lado del mundo, a ver si tengo suerte y hace que se me pase me ayuda con este aburrimiento jajaja
14/6/20 17:10 - Joe: 😂
14/6/20 17:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 17:11 - Joe: That sucks you have to stay in that zone though. Can’t run away.
14/6/20 17:14 - Lorena: Jajaja locoooo. Siii voss. No me dejes sola
14/6/20 17:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 17:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 17:17 - Joe: And before you judge my shirt, my friend made it hahaha
14/6/20 17:18 - Lorena: Jajaja se puede tener más cara de dormido? No
14/6/20 17:19 - Lorena: Jajaj me gusta! No la juzgo!! Este es el que hizo el diseño de los dados?
14/6/20 17:21 - Joe: No this is another friend of mine. He makes clothes as a little side gig type of thing. He is the one I was trying to convince to use my e-commerce website I was building
14/6/20 17:22 - Joe: He is taking forever to give me all the things I need to complete it for him though
14/6/20 17:28 - Lorena: Sii me acuerdo, que bien a ver si te lo manda
14/6/20 17:28 - Lorena: Igual mientras si no tenés muchos trabajos podés ir inventandote algunos para practicar y tener más portfolio
14/6/20 17:38 - Joe: Yeah that’s true. I need more projects in the portfolio for sure. Maybe I should work on that a little bit today.
14/6/20 17:40 - Joe: Damn tomorrow I start camp. Going to be a little strange with all the extra stuff we have to do. Hopefully since it’s only half days we can mostly skate outside and not have to worry too much.
14/6/20 17:41 - Joe: They had all kinds of rules for cleaning things before and after they get used, social distancing, when to wear mask and/or gloves
14/6/20 17:44 - Lorena: 💪
14/6/20 17:44 - Lorena: Ya odio la mascarilla, no me deja respirar bien .. pero es obligatoria en todos los sitios
14/6/20 17:45 - Lorena: Excepto cuando estás en una terraza de bar, jaja sin sentido
14/6/20 17:45 - Lorena: En realidad acá guantes no se llevan, gel con alcohol cada vez que tocas algo
14/6/20 17:46 - Lorena: Lo bueno es que estarás al aire libre, como es? Enseñas un truco y los chicos los repiten? Jajaja o como?
14/6/20 17:48 - Joe: Este mensaje fue eliminado
14/6/20 17:48 - Joe: haha sorry
14/6/20 17:48 - Joe: didn't mean to send that
14/6/20 17:48 - Lorena: 🙄
14/6/20 17:49 - Joe: I think i only need gloves for when kids are getting to camp. I check them in and have to take their temperature and ask a bunch of questions every morning
14/6/20 17:49 - Lorena: Que era? Jaja
14/6/20 17:50 - Joe: Yeah pretty much. We get everyone into groups by skill level and teach tricks and how to skate the park better in general
14/6/20 17:50 - Joe: how to utilize the ramps better and all that
14/6/20 17:51 - Joe: I'm on my computer and i accidentally hit send halfway through typing a sentence haha
14/6/20 17:53 - Lorena: Jaja chusma
14/6/20 17:53 - Lorena: Clarooo, que edades tienen los chicos? Y cuántos son?
14/6/20 17:53 - Lorena: Aunque muchas veces los mayores son peores para hacer caso a las reglas
14/6/20 17:54 - Lorena: Divertido, sé que en algún momento si quiero entonces tendré profe? Jaja
14/6/20 17:55 - Joe: I think it's 7 to 14 year olds. And we get a maximum of 12.
14/6/20 17:57 - Joe: Of course hahaha i'm an fairly decent teacher of skateboarding i think 😂
14/6/20 18:10 - Lorena: Que chiquis con 7 añitos jjj . Cuáles te gustan más? Chicos o grandes?
14/6/20 18:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 18:13 - Joe: Hmmmm I like the older ones but we don’t get many
14/6/20 18:13 - Joe: We get more girls than we do boys between 10-14
14/6/20 18:14 - Lorena: Jaja claro más divertido mayores
14/6/20 18:14 - Lorena: Ah sí? Que bienn! Estarán enamoradas de su profesor rulitos jajaj
14/6/20 18:15 - Joe: They’re just mellower and easier to deal with haha. If there is a little one that is super well behaved they’ll end up being my favorite haha.
14/6/20 18:16 - Joe: Oh god I hope not hahaha
14/6/20 18:16 - Lorena: Jaja papi Joe
14/6/20 18:18 - Lorena: Jaja las adolescentes uuuh
14/6/20 18:18 - Lorena: Son más "traviesas" algunas jaja
14/6/20 18:20 - Joe: Haha good thing we don’t get too many teenage girls either. 1 or 2 maybe. Lots of younger girls though which is interesting. Parents signing them up for skate camp. They’re usually pretty cool though, more helpful and listen better than the boys haha
14/6/20 18:23 - Lorena: Jajaja
14/6/20 18:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 18:25 - Lorena: Esta bueno que las niñas más pequeñas tengan la posibilidad de patinar también, al final siempre son mayoría los chicos en estas cosas
14/6/20 18:28 - Joe: The demographics are changing slowly in skateboarding. Lots of girls are skating now. It’s cool to see. Skateboarding is supposed to be for everyone so I like to see it expanding.
14/6/20 18:30 - Lorena: Claro está bueno eso
14/6/20 18:32 - Lorena: Me gusta que pienses así
14/6/20 18:32 - Lorena: +1punto jaja
14/6/20 18:33 - Lorena: Tengo ganas de "bailar", con música super alta jajaja
14/6/20 18:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 18:34 - Joe: Hahahaha
14/6/20 18:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 18:38 - Lorena: Jajaja
14/6/20 18:38 - Lorena: Que sexy
14/6/20 20:07 - Joe: Ooooh shit sorry I fell back asleep!
14/6/20 20:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 20:09 - Lorena: Jajaja no pasa nada! Era pronto por lo menos aguantaste hablándome un rato
14/6/20 20:14 - Joe: I tried haha. Then I ate a little and didn’t have a coffee. Made me sleepy again
14/6/20 23:40 - Lorena: Que tal?
14/6/20 23:41 - Lorena: Yo fui a un bar con mis amigas y desconecté del trabajo
14/6/20 23:41 - Joe: haha you probably needed that after listening to those chicks all day
14/6/20 23:41 - Joe: I'm good, just messing with some of my old projects. Cleaning up the code a little bit
14/6/20 23:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 23:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 23:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/6/20 23:43 - Joe: Haha you love little Rogel. You always have him wrapped up like his Kangaroo mama hahaha
14/6/20 23:43 - Lorena: Si normalmente, no suelo ser antipática. Pero con ciertas personas así me sacan energía jaja
14/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: Jajajaja 🤭
14/6/20 23:45 - Joe: Yeah i was surprised when you starting talking shit about them hahaha not a bad thing though. Can't be super sweet all the time haha
14/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: Normalmente duerme con Luchi por la noche y cuando ella se va abre mi habitación y se mete en mi cama.. pero esta semana trabajo por la mañana y tendré que irme pronto 😭
14/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: Ups Kaká
14/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: Jaja
14/6/20 23:47 - Lorena: Soy dulce con la gente que me cae bien, con gente superficial la verdad que no lo soy
14/6/20 23:47 - Lorena: 🤷🤷🤷
14/6/20 23:48 - Joe: Haha i can tell. You're very sweet with meeee 😂 But that's totally understandable. I really dislike superficiality
14/6/20 23:51 - Lorena: Jajaj si, vos no te podés quejar. Te tengo "mimado"
14/6/20 23:55 - Joe: Being sweet is all part of your scheme to get me to Spain haha
14/6/20 23:56 - Joe: I'm interested to see/hear you get mad or annoyed at me a little bit haha I reaaaaallly want to know what you get like when you're upset with me. I
14/6/20 23:56 - Joe: I'm sure i'll push your buttons enough to find out eventually haha
14/6/20 23:57 - Lorena: Jajaja 🤭🤭🤭
15/6/20 0:00 - Lorena: Sabés que tengo carácter, puedo ser dulce cuando estoy bien pero cuando estoy mal o algo me molesta, me puedo enojar mucho jaja
15/6/20 0:02 - Joe: haha i'm nervous 😂
15/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: puedo enojarme.. a lo mejor hay veces que por cosas tontas o algunas que me molesten de verdad como a todo el mundo, pero no soy nada rencorosa, me considero comprensiva y hago las paces rápido jaja
15/6/20 0:03 - Joe: Alright haha for sure. I'm sure i can handle it regardless. I just want to be prepared haha
15/6/20 0:03 - Lorena: Bueno ya lo sabes, estás a tiempo de no venir a verme jaja no soy dulce las 24hs
15/6/20 0:04 - Lorena: 😬😂
15/6/20 0:05 - Joe: Haha i don't expect you to be sweet all the time. I just want to know how to work with the type of person you are. If you're the type that needs space or needs to talk about it right away, it's good to know these things
15/6/20 0:06 - Joe: It sucks when someone doesn't understand how you deal with being angry. Usually that leads to even more anger and bigger fights haha.
15/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: Jaja Joe psicólogo
15/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: Mmm, en realidad cuando estoy enojada y me dejan espacio puede que sea peor
15/6/20 0:08 - Joe: i just like to know what works and what doesn't haha.
15/6/20 0:08 - Joe: hahah ok so don't give too much room when you're mad...got it
15/6/20 0:08 - Lorena: Jajaj es raro tener que explicarlo
15/6/20 0:10 - Lorena: Pero depende.. normalmente si algo me molesta y no estás encima mío, puede que deje de darte importancia, por que siento que me estás dando mucho espacio =poco interés
15/6/20 0:11 - Lorena: Jaja no sé, depende la situación. Yo siempre creo que la comunicacion es clave. Puedo ponerme en tu lugar y vos en el mío si en algún momento no estamos de acuerdo.
15/6/20 0:12 - Joe: Ok ok i get that. Makes sense.
15/6/20 0:13 - Joe: Well....i want you to know that if you feel i'm not giving you enough of anything, attention or space, let me know. I agree that communication is key so be as open as you can and i'll try my best to do the same
15/6/20 0:14 - Lorena: Jaja hacé lo que vos sientas
15/6/20 0:14 - Lorena: No lo que yo pueda querer
15/6/20 0:15 - Lorena: Valoro que tengas interés por complacerme
15/6/20 0:16 - Lorena: De hecho siempre haces que me sienta cómoda, siempre me escribís o estás pendiente, aunque estés lejos
15/6/20 0:19 - Joe: Noooo problem. I just want to know more about you haha. I'm super interested in what you're like day to day now since we've been talking for so long.
15/6/20 0:23 - Lorena: Yo también quiero saber más de vos
15/6/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:26 - Joe: Soon I hope 🤞
15/6/20 0:27 - Lorena: Jajaj raper
15/6/20 0:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:28 - Joe: Hahahah superstar!
15/6/20 0:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:30 - Lorena: Jaja este no pareces vos de cara
15/6/20 0:30 - Lorena: Las manos si
15/6/20 0:31 - Joe: Hahah it’s all in the hands. I need to find more haha
15/6/20 0:32 - Lorena: Jjjj sii busca
15/6/20 0:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:36 - Joe: Aah what you got to ride horses? Siiiick
15/6/20 0:39 - Joe: Damn you have so many haha i can't find more. When i do i'll send them though. You win this round haha
15/6/20 0:41 - Lorena: No, era una granja a la que íbamos de pequeños y me encantaba, con animales y recogiendo choclos
15/6/20 0:42 - Lorena: No tengo más, solo algunas encontré en casa de mis padres
15/6/20 0:45 - Lorena: Joe, al final no me respondiste. Como sos vos, jaja sí te enfadas conmigo en algún momento o " I'll push your buttons", que tendría que hacer? Jjj
15/6/20 0:47 - Joe: Oh sorry haha. It's situational for me. If i'm only a little mad or annoyed, i'd like to talk about it. But if i get really upset, to the point i want to yell, i would rather just have space and not fight. Take time to breathe then come back and talk about it.
15/6/20 0:47 - Joe: It's really hard to upset me to the point of yelling. That's rare. But when it does happen space for a short time, with the understanding we'll try to talk about it later, is best for me.
15/6/20 0:49 - Joe: But most of the time I just try to bring up what i'm feeling if there are any problems before it gets to be too big of a deal and since you seem like you're willing to talk to me about things we should be good
15/6/20 0:51 - Lorena: Jaja uuh no te imagino gritando
15/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Pero si llego a tocarte los "botones" jajaja tomaré espacio
15/6/20 0:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/6/20 0:55 - Joe: haha it's super rare. Not much upsets me to that point.
15/6/20 0:57 - Joe: Now i know what you mean about it being hard to describe haha
15/6/20 0:57 - Joe: But I don't want you to think i get super mad often cause i don't. I try to not let things bug me.
15/6/20 0:58 - Lorena: Jaja está bien no pasa nada
15/6/20 1:00 - Joe: What time do you have to get up tomorrow?
15/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: Solo quería saberlo también, no sé si algún día discutiremos a este punto jajaj, pero creo que el vínculo que creamos es a base de diálogo y buena comunicación
15/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: No empieces Joe!
15/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: Jaja
15/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: A las 11 entro

15/6/20 1:01 - Lorena: Me cortaste la conversación jaja
15/6/20 1:02 - Lorena: Y ya me estás "echando"
15/6/20 1:02 - Joe: Hahahah nooo i was just asking
15/6/20 1:03 - Joe: If you have more questions, ask away haha
15/6/20 1:03 - Lorena: No ya no tengo jaja
15/6/20 1:03 - Lorena: Me iré a dormir
15/6/20 1:04 - Joe: Noooooooooooo
15/6/20 1:04 - Joe: hahah
15/6/20 1:04 - Lorena: Al final no coincidermos para hablar 🤷
15/6/20 1:04 - Joe: hahaha
15/6/20 1:05 - Joe: i only asked what time you have to wake up 😂
15/6/20 1:05 - Joe: I threw off your whole vibe haha my bad
15/6/20 1:06 - Lorena: Mmm jaja bueno no importa

16/6/20 0:44 - Lorena: Al menos conseguí que la estés viendo
16/6/20 0:48 - Joe: All romance type movies are a little corny so i can't judge too harshly. I'm enjoying it so far though
16/6/20 0:49 - Lorena: Biennn!!

16/6/20 1:04 - Joe: Hahah this must be one of your top 5 favorite movies
16/6/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jaja es que películas no suelen gustarme muchas
16/6/20 1:05 - Lorena: Pero las que me gustan, las recuerdo bien
16/6/20 1:06 - Lorena: Los odiosos ocho (The hateful eight) me gustó mucho también y no tiene nada que ver a esta, es súper sangrienta jaja 🙄
16/6/20 1:10 - Joe: Hahah good to know. You had to tell me to make sure I don’t think you only like “corny” movies 😂 

They just got off the boat in the rain. Some funny stuff in there but the drama continues haha


Not too corny but some of the lines made me laugh.
16/6/20 1:13 - Lorena: Jajaja si, no quiero que pienses que soy una cursi de pelis tontas de amor. No, no, no. Jaja esta es diferente 🤫
16/6/20 1:15 - Lorena: Ohhh si, la lluvia jaja mierda no quiero hacerte spoiler
16/6/20 1:16 - Joe: Haha yeah no spoilers. I’m at the part where Allie is asking her mom about the letters
16/6/20 1:17 - Lorena: Ah ella no duerme ahí no?
16/6/20 1:17 - Lorena: Se va al hotel
16/6/20 1:17 - Lorena: Y luego la zorra de su madre le cuenta que se las escondió
16/6/20 1:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 1:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 1:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 1:26 - Lorena: Jaja siempre se me escapa algo. Aunque yo odio cuando a mí me hacen spoiler, mi madre principalmente 😑
16/6/20 1:27 - Lorena: Te dejo verlaaa 🤐😚
16/6/20 1:27 - Joe: 😂
16/6/20 1:53 - Joe: Well that was a pretty sad movie
16/6/20 1:54 - Joe: When she remembered and then after they dance she gets all mad. Hella sad dammit haha it was good though. Noa was a coooool dude
16/6/20 1:55 - Lorena: Esa parte es con la que lloro normalmente
16/6/20 1:57 - Lorena: Jaja,  me parece tan real y tan triste verlo de mayor
16/6/20 1:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 1:58 - Lorena: Yo? Jaja muchasss
16/6/20 1:58 - Joe: Yeah my grandma on my moms side had something similar. She forgot everyone
16/6/20 1:58 - Lorena: Vos?
16/6/20 1:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 1:59 - Lorena: Jajaj
16/6/20 1:59 - Joe: People definitely get easily upset when they're like that
16/6/20 1:59 - Joe: hahaha
16/6/20 2:00 - Lorena: 😮😟 que duro
16/6/20 2:00 - Joe: Oh the one cool thing about forgetting everything was, we tricked her into thinking she quit smoking hahaha
16/6/20 2:01 - Joe: One day she was going to go buy her pack of smokes and my aunt just told her, "you don't smoke anymore, remember?". Grandma said, "oh i don't? Ok" and never smoked again.
16/6/20 2:01 - Lorena: Jajaja buenísimo
16/6/20 2:02 - Lorena: 😲👏👏👏
16/6/20 2:03 - Joe: When that happened she was in her 80s i think, and she had been smoking since a teenager haha. She passed away like 10 years ago but it's just an interesting example of how powerful those mental problems can be.
16/6/20 2:03 - Joe: But yeah, in the movie, super said that moment when she remembers haha
16/6/20 2:03 - Lorena: Super interesante!!
16/6/20 2:04 - Joe: sad* not said
16/6/20 2:04 - Joe: That was a rollercoaster of drama haha
16/6/20 2:05 - Lorena: Si, cuando ella recuerda y cuando noa la ve sufrir mientras le dan calmantes
16/6/20 2:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 2:06 - Lorena: Me gustaría ver tu cara mientas la miras jajaj
16/6/20 2:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

16/6/20 4:04 - Joe: Nooo worries

16/6/20 4:05 - Joe: Haha I just thought it was a good story. Beautiful. Both happy and sad. Like real life. It’s complicated.

16/6/20 15:28 - Lorena: Que tal ayer con la peli? Jaja estaba aguantando y caí cao jaja
16/6/20 15:30 - Joe: Oh nice good timing
16/6/20 15:31 - Joe: Yeah doesn’t seem too difficult at all. I need to get some land haha
16/6/20 15:31 - Joe: I enjoyed the movie a lot. I was very into it haha
16/6/20 15:32 - Lorena: Sii?
16/6/20 15:33 - Lorena: Espero que no haya sido demasiado cursi, pero la historia me pareció linda
16/6/20 15:38 - Joe: Nah it wasn’t too corny haha. I liked it. The story was beautifully sad haha good movie
16/6/20 15:54 - Lorena: Jaja me alegro!!
16/6/20 15:57 - Lorena: Y que tal ayer volviendo a trabajar?
16/6/20 15:57 - Lorena: Entras en un rato no?
16/6/20 16:03 - Joe: Work is going well. First day went smooth besides one kid having a mini meltdown and not wanting to do anything but he’s not in my group haha. I have to go to work in about 30-45 minutes
16/6/20 16:14 - Lorena: Jajaj pobre niño

16/6/20 21:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: Así no agarrás corona virus 😅
16/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: Jajaja el niño te pilló ahí haciéndote el video
16/6/20 21:32 - Lorena: 5 horas así con tu café jaja muy bien! pero estoy perdida con tus horarios al final trabajas hasta qué hora normalmente?
16/6/20 21:35 - Joe: Hahah thats my coworker for today
16/6/20 21:37 - Joe: So normally I work a very short day. 8:30am until 12:30. But sometimes I’ll pick up extra hours monitoring the park or giving private lessons. On those days I’m not sure what time I’ll get off. Depends on the day
16/6/20 21:38 - Lorena: Ahhhh hoy estás haciendo como extra de monitor
16/6/20 21:38 - Lorena: Vigilando
16/6/20 21:38 - Lorena: Y que haces jaja les gritas desde ahí con tu café? 😅
16/6/20 21:39 - Lorena: Quiero ver una de esas correcciones
16/6/20 21:41 - Joe: Hahaha we have a limit on how many people can enter so I’m sitting by the entrance keeping track and letting people in
16/6/20 21:42 - Lorena: Ahhh, pero el skatepark es público, ahora puede ir cualquiera. O solo tus alumnos?
16/6/20 21:43 - Joe: It’s open to the public now. Camp ended at noon(40 minutes ago)
16/6/20 21:44 - Joe: It’s cool though. I just hang out here and skate once in while to pass the time. Should go by quick. I like getting paid to be at the skatepark anyway. Best job 😂
16/6/20 21:47 - Lorena: Ahh ahora sí entendí okey
16/6/20 21:48 - Lorena: Jaja sí el trabajo pinta bien, trabajo "eterna juventud"
16/6/20 21:51 - Joe: Hahah someone said I looked hella young for 30 yesterday. They didn’t believe my age when I told them. It was pretty funny.
16/6/20 21:53 - Lorena: 🤭🤭
16/6/20 22:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 23:31 - Lorena: Jajaja
16/6/20 23:31 - Lorena: Cómo lo llevas?
16/6/20 23:35 - Joe: I’m bored haha. I skated for a while and now my legs are getting sore.
16/6/20 23:36 - Joe: Only 2 1/2 hours to go though. Not bad
16/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: Jjj tus piernas desde que llegaste a California
16/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/6/20 23:51 - Joe: Hahaha true! I’ve been skating too much since I got back and not enough when I was in Hawaii. Have to build the strength back up.
16/6/20 23:51 - Joe: How are youuu? What’re you doing?
17/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: Jaja bueno en Hawaii estabas más relax, solo paseíto mañanero a la playa
17/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: Yo bien, estaba cenando con las chicas y ya ahora en la habitaciones
17/6/20 0:06 - Lorena: *Habitación
17/6/20 0:09 - Joe: Yeah it was great haha
17/6/20 10:09 - Joe: Buenos días. I want our old schedules back. I’m getting ready to go to bed soon but I wanted to say hello first haha
17/6/20 10:21 - Joe: Oh last thing before I fall asleep...I don’t think I sent you this before. What this dude built is really cool to me. It has subtitles you can turn on. 


Ok, miss you, talk to you later. Have a good day

17/6/20 10:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 10:38 - Joe: Oh for sure I agee. I really want to work something out to make sure we keep talking.
17/6/20 10:38 - Joe: And I don’t want you to feel like I’m not giving you attention or something like that.
17/6/20 10:39 - Joe: That’s why I wanted to say something to you before I went to bed. I really want to talk to you all the time but it’s just been difficult lately.
17/6/20 10:40 - Lorena: Que bien, que puedas decirme esto y sientas lo mismo!
17/6/20 10:42 - Lorena: Esta bien saberloo! Gracias bombón, te dejo dormir! Pensemos algo para poder sacar tiempo los dos. Un abrazo!! Que duermas súper bien!
17/6/20 10:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 10:44 - Joe: Haha Jealous of these cats. Thank you. Alright have a good morning ☀️
17/6/20 16:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 16:34 - Lorena: Jajaja ohhh

17/6/20 17:02 - Lorena: Upsss jaja
17/6/20 17:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 17:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 17:55 - Lorena: Jajajaja genio
17/6/20 20:40 - Joe: Damn I thought I was tan when I was in Hawaii but I’m getting hella darker being at the skatepark haha. Another chaotic day of camp almost over 😀
17/6/20 21:02 - Lorena: Jajaj chico del asfalto poniéndose moreno
17/6/20 21:03 - Lorena: A ver si me mostras ese tono moreno jajaj
17/6/20 21:03 - Lorena: Hoy también haces vigilancia del skatepark? Q tal con los nenes?
17/6/20 21:17 - Joe: No monitoring for me today. I’m heading home now. My board hit me in my arm and face hahaha now my arm hurts and i have a little bump on my chin 😂
17/6/20 22:10 - Lorena: Nooo
17/6/20 22:10 - Lorena: Pobrecito!!!
17/6/20 22:16 - Lorena: Yo me vine a la sierra por el cumple de mi hermano, fuimos a cenar y estoy llenisima! Ya me voy para Madrid
17/6/20 22:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 22:21 - Lorena: Jajaja si tuve que desabrocharme el botón del pantalón
17/6/20 22:21 - Joe: Get back home safe. Happy birthday to your brother 🥳 🎊
17/6/20 22:21 - Joe: 😂
17/6/20 22:21 - Joe: You need to wear some stretchy pants next time
17/6/20 22:22 - Lorena: Gracias!
17/6/20 22:23 - Lorena: Mi madre le hizo un vídeo recopilando algunas fotos y yo le agregué música y alguna más.. el parecía fuerte al principio y terminó soltando unas lágrimas jajaja
17/6/20 22:23 - Lorena: Mi madre y yo también claro jaja
17/6/20 22:25 - Joe: Hahaha you got him to shed a tear. Didn’t even have to make him watch The Notebook first haha.
17/6/20 22:26 - Joe: That’s sweet though. Videos like that are great, looking back at all the memories and stuff
17/6/20 22:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 22:28 - Lorena: Jaja sí el no es de llorar , pero mi madre encontró unas cuantas fotos de cuando era pequeño y empezó a correr y eso le tocó la fibra jjj
17/6/20 22:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 22:29 - Lorena: Yo pedí unos ravioles rellenos de pera con crema de gorgonzola. Me gusta probar sabores diferentes
17/6/20 22:34 - Joe: hahah what was with the music? Looks like a good time
17/6/20 22:35 - Lorena: Jaja que al principio le pusieron una canción de cumpleaños y al segundo salió una de navidad 🤭😅
17/6/20 22:35 - Joe: Sounds good. How did you like it?
17/6/20 22:36 - Joe: Ooooh, yeah i was confused when the Christmas music came on  haha
17/6/20 22:38 - Lorena: Mm me gusta lo clásico de siempre, pero si voy a comer a algún restaurante me gusta pedir cosas con especias, como curry o combinaciones con frutas tropicales en salsas o algo de eso. Depende
17/6/20 22:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 22:40 - Joe: That makes sense. Have the fancier stuff when you go out. You can make the classic stuff at home haha
17/6/20 22:41 - Joe: Hella cute
17/6/20 22:41 - Lorena: Si, a vos que tipo de comida te gusta? O que no te gusta?
17/6/20 22:42 - Joe: Hmmm I'm not a huge fan of sushi but i still eat it haha
17/6/20 22:44 - Joe: I don't know what i like. Just good tasting food haha. Most things grilled on a barbecue is delicious to me. Lots of meat dishes.
17/6/20 22:45 - Joe: My favorite dish is probably lomo saltado
17/6/20 22:45 - Joe: hella good mmmmm i want some now
17/6/20 22:46 - Lorena: Jaja entonces vos de vegetariano difícil jaja
17/6/20 22:46 - Lorena: Perú no?
17/6/20 22:47 - Lorena: Jajaj
17/6/20 22:47 - Joe: Oh i love to eat a good bowl of pho. We have some really good Vietnamese food places around here. Ah there is too much stuff i like. Some i don't like but i'll give most things a try
17/6/20 22:47 - Joe: Yes it's a Peruvian dish
17/6/20 22:48 - Lorena: Ah eso es típico ahí o por gente de tu alrededor? Acá no se ve demasiado vietnamita..nunca probé eso
17/6/20 22:51 - Joe: The bay area is a really good place for trying different kinds of food. You can find food from any culture relatively easy around here with a short drive. There are quite a few Vietnamese places around me. It's super good. Especially if you want some hot soup
17/6/20 22:51 - Joe: mmmm
17/6/20 22:54 - Joe: Oh and food from a good taco truck is always smackin haha
17/6/20 22:55 - Joe: I can't believe you've never had Pho
17/6/20 22:57 - Lorena: Jaja sí como acá, hay mucho kebab, italiano, mexicano, indios en general
17/6/20 22:58 - Lorena: Hella smackinn jaja tacos 🤤
17/6/20 22:59 - Lorena: Jaja no, pero se me ocurre que cuando lo pruebe será con vos, te parece? Jaja
17/6/20 23:03 - Joe: Damn I sure hope so!
17/6/20 23:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 23:06 - Lorena: Me encantaria conocer Vietnam.. Filipinas...
17/6/20 23:07 - Lorena: Viajar es lo mejor
17/6/20 23:08 - Lorena: Es como que valoras más la vida
17/6/20 23:11 - Joe: Yeah that's true. It can definitely change your perspective on life
17/6/20 23:14 - Joe: I have friends that have gone on trips to the Philippines and Vietnam and they enjoyed the time there. I need to go
17/6/20 23:16 - Lorena: Si fuese "libre" ahora te diría de encontrarnos en algún país de Asia jaja aprendería un poco de inglés por las dudas jajajja
17/6/20 23:19 - Joe: Hahah that would be siiiiick. If only we were free now. We'll get there eventually haha
17/6/20 23:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 23:22 - Joe: Haha I only call her on the weekends officially now. Sometimes I call during the week but I get busy so I don’t want her waiting for me when my schedule changes.
17/6/20 23:23 - Joe: I’m still learning haha I’m sure you’ll get a little English figured out too so we’ll be fiiine 😂
17/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: Jaja pero hablan en español o ya no?
17/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: Malditos horarios
17/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 23:47 - Lorena: Jajaj si, creo que voy a empezar clases por Skype con una academia, ya estuve averiguando la semana pasada pero no es seguro jaja tengo que ver mis horarios 🙊
17/6/20 23:47 - Joe: I’m still so terrible at stringing together a sentence so a lot of it is me listening to her speak Spanish to me. But I try to speak Spanish when I can figure out a sentence or two
17/6/20 23:49 - Lorena: Podés practicar conmigo, ya lo sabes!!! Hoy bien hablando comparandote con el aguacate 😂
17/6/20 23:49 - Joe: When you send me audio clips too. I just listen over and over and try to hear what you’re saying really well. I don’t know. I’m trying though. I still have my notebook which I forgot at work today because I was trying to look at it when I had time haha
17/6/20 23:50 - Joe: Oh yeah I did get my one sentence in this morning haha. It’s difficult to remind myself to practice but I try
17/6/20 23:50 - Lorena: Jajaj ohh. Imagínate que alguien encuentra ese cuaderno con todas las notas en español 🤭🤣
17/6/20 23:51 - Joe: They’d be so confused. My notes are all over the place. I also have my sketches for websites and notes for programming.
17/6/20 23:51 - Lorena: Si me hizo gracia, no me lo esperaba jajaja
17/6/20 23:51 - Joe: A bunch of nonsense in that notebook to whoever finds it haha
17/6/20 23:53 - Joe: My spanish will be limited to one liners that resemble the structure of a meme 😂
17/6/20 23:54 - Joe: Hahah nah I’ll get better though. My vocabulary is just super limited still. I haven’t been studying vocabulary enough
17/6/20 23:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/6/20 23:54 - Lorena: Gif/ vídeos/ fotos
17/6/20 23:55 - Lorena: Tenés que apuntarte las cosas que yo digo
17/6/20 23:56 - Joe: Hahaha wow that’s a lot of stuff we sent to each other 😂
17/6/20 23:57 - Joe: Hahah that’s hard. You always say things in different ways
18/6/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jajaj mmmm
18/6/20 0:00 - Joe: The only thing you say often is that you’re sorry you fell asleep haha other than that you vary your sentences quite a bit so you might say something similar but it isn’t the same phrase
18/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: Jajajaja
18/6/20 0:02 - Joe: Unlike me hahah I’ll say the same exact thing over and over 😂
18/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: Si eso no hay muchas maneras de decirlo
18/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: Mierda, me quedé dormida
18/6/20 0:03 - Joe: Hahah that’s the one. You’re most used phrase by far haha
18/6/20 0:03 - Joe: Your*
18/6/20 0:03 - Lorena: No, vos decís un montón de cosas que yo no entiendo y directamente uso traductor jaja es muy rápido
18/6/20 0:04 - Lorena: La tuya es es "me quedé dormido en el sofá"
18/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: O.. me levanté demasiado pronto jaja aunque eso ya no te pasa, solo en Hawaii
18/6/20 0:05 - Joe: Haha siii
18/6/20 0:06 - Joe: Yeah now I got up too late. My body is still in Hawaii time. 8am feels like 5am to me.
18/6/20 0:08 - Lorena: Jaja eso te viene mejor
18/6/20 0:09 - Joe: It does haha
18/6/20 0:10 - Joe: Wait I missed this thing. So what class are you going to take?
18/6/20 0:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/6/20 0:14 - Lorena: Mmm no sé si me entenderas, te lo escribo
18/6/20 0:17 - Lorena: "Estuve averiguando en algunas academias pero me aburre tremendamente tener que ir a clase, entonces estaba pensando alguna opción online, Skype o algo de eso y hay una academia que está bien porque son clases de conversación y son diferentes profesores con diferentes acentos.. y nada.. son dos horas por semana y creo que en la clase somos como de 3 a 8 alumnos nada más.. Así que no sé, puede estar bie, puedo probarlo"
18/6/20 0:17 - Lorena: Te lo escribí tal cual, así podés escuchar mientras lees
18/6/20 0:18 - Lorena: Puede estar( *bien)
18/6/20 0:19 - Joe: Thanks. I appreciate that. That was a lot to type out haha
18/6/20 0:20 - Joe: Eh actually I wasn’t far off from listening to you. There is sooo much I didn’t hear correctly or comprehend but got enough that I was “in the ballpark”
18/6/20 0:22 - Lorena: Ah siiii???? Uhh jaja muy bien!
18/6/20 0:23 - Joe: When you say things like “que ir a clase” the words all blend together haha. Like “tener quira clase”
18/6/20 0:24 - Lorena: Jajajaja qué gracia
18/6/20 0:24 - Lorena: A ver voy a escucharlo
18/6/20 0:24 - Joe: I wasn’t very confident though haha and like I said I missed a lot of it. when I translated i realized I had the basic idea of what you were saying but I missed the specifics
18/6/20 0:25 - Lorena: Es verdad jaja es que lo digo muy rápido
18/6/20 0:26 - Joe: Yeah whenever you start to speed up you lose me a little but it’s ok. It’s good to hear what someone really sounds like when they say these things. The same blending of words happens often when people speak English too
18/6/20 0:26 - Lorena: Digo mucho como "coletilla" y nada.. jaja eso siempre lo digo.. nadaa.. blabla
18/6/20 0:27 - Lorena: Me alegra que puedas entender la idea, aprovecharé para enseñarte esos detalles, así no te quejas de que soy mala profesora jajaj
18/6/20 0:27 - Joe: Haha sometimes you say “nada” and my brain totally gets stuck on how it is connected to what you are saying 😂
18/6/20 0:28 - Joe: Like I think you said “nada” at the beginning of an audio clip one time and it confused the crap out of me because it changed the context of what you were saying when I translated it in my head haha
18/6/20 0:28 - Lorena: Jajaja ya... 🙊 Además lo digo demasiado pero no siempre en los mismos momentos
18/6/20 0:29 - Lorena: Igual en inglés muchas de tus palabras, en inglés británico las entiendo pero en inglés americano es como 🥴🥴🥴 que? Jajaj
18/6/20 0:31 - Joe: Haha that’s strange. I guess I need to speak “proper English” so you can understand me 😂
18/6/20 0:32 - Lorena: Cuando enseñe algún video a mis amigas, ellas estaban como ... 😯 Esta diciendo esto? Jaja y sonaba tan diferente a como nos lo enseñaron en el colegio
18/6/20 0:32 - Lorena: Fue gracioso jaja
18/6/20 0:35 - Joe: Haha damn I still haven’t shown a video of you to my friends. I want to now. I need to get there reactions.
18/6/20 0:38 - Joe: But they’ve probably all lurked on your Instagram already I bet cause everyone is so nosy haha
18/6/20 0:38 - Lorena: Jajajaja
18/6/20 0:39 - Lorena: El día que publicamos las casitas tu hermano volvió a caer 😂😂
18/6/20 0:39 - Lorena: Y esta vez su novia también jajaja 🙊
18/6/20 0:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
18/6/20 0:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/6/20 0:46 - Joe: You never know I might end up inviting you to his wedding next year haha
18/6/20 0:46 - Lorena: Y un o una talish? O algo así?  Mm no me acuerdo tenía una foto con varias tablas creo
18/6/20 0:47 - Joe: Busted haha
18/6/20 0:48 - Lorena: Jajajj 💃🕺mitad de los invitados hablen mi idioma, genial jajaj
18/6/20 0:49 - Lorena: Que bueno se casan, pero es súper joven tu hermano, no?
18/6/20 0:52 - Joe: He is 2 years younger than me
18/6/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha that’s true. It would be a good time. Got to get you to the US though. It’s in Eugene, Oregon
18/6/20 0:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/6/20 1:01 - Joe: Hahah fuck that guy. I'll get you here
18/6/20 1:01 - Joe: med

18/6/20 1:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
18/6/20 1:07 - Joe: Hahah one of the little kids at skate camp said he likes Andrew Yang 😂
18/6/20 1:07 - Lorena: Me voy a dormir antes de repetir mi frase ... Jaja. Mañana otra vez a trabajar... Hoy fue libre!
18/6/20 1:08 - Lorena: Jaja es tu niño preferido no??
18/6/20 1:09 - Joe: He's cool. His name is Marco Joseph haha my middle name is Marco. So i'm Joseph Marco. And he is Peruvian. He doesn't like skating that much though so that's points off for him.
18/6/20 1:10 - Joe: Alright i'll talk to you later. Sleep well! Buenas noches 😘
18/6/20 1:11 - Lorena: Que casualidad! Pero no le gusta patinar? Y por qué va al skatecamp?
18/6/20 1:12 - Joe: He comes every year with his friend

22/6/20 21:23 - Joe: Hahaha oh god 😂
22/6/20 21:25 - Joe: Oooh nice. I wonder what they have over there to skate in the plaza
22/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: Jaja tranqui no!
22/6/20 21:33 - Lorena: Mm bancos supongo es que no me acuerdo, y punto de reunión..de pequeña fui alguna vez .. me acercaré a la plaza otro día a cotillear
22/6/20 21:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 21:36 - Joe: Looks cool! Some nice ledges and stuff. Banks are fun too. Yeah tell me what they have when you find out haha
22/6/20 21:47 - Lorena: 🤙🤙
22/6/20 22:19 - Joe: I got my appointment to apply for my passport tomorrow. I think normally it takes 6-8 weeks but it’s supposed to take longer right now 😞
22/6/20 22:31 - Lorena: 😲 cuánto tiempo! Acá te lo dan en una semana normalmente jaja
22/6/20 22:31 - Lorena: Bueno genial que tengas la cita mañana!!!! 👏👏 Ya tenés fotito? Jaja
22/6/20 22:33 - Joe: Haha damn I wish it was that fast here. I don’t have a photo but I can pay $15 to get one taken at my appointment. I need to fill out some paperwork and make a photocopy of some paperwork though
22/6/20 22:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 22:44 - Lorena: Eh???? 15 dólares por una foto?
22/6/20 22:44 - Lorena: Jaja boludo anda a una máquina de fotos y listo
22/6/20 22:44 - Lorena: 15 dólares por la cita será no?o por el pasaporte?
22/6/20 22:44 - Lorena: 😂😂
22/6/20 22:44 - Joe: hahaha it is what it is 🤷‍♂️
22/6/20 22:51 - Lorena: No puede ser Joe
22/6/20 22:51 - Lorena: Jaja 15 dólares una foto?
22/6/20 22:51 - Lorena: Cuánto sale sacarte el pasaporte?
22/6/20 22:53 - Joe: Haha the passport services are $35 and yes, unfortunately the photo really is $15 ahaha
22/6/20 22:54 - Joe: They'll probably charge some other fees too. Who knows. So far it's $50 total. We'll find out tomorrow if i have to spend more than that for the actual passport itself. Cause the receipt said i paid for "passport services" which makes me think i only paid for the appointment
22/6/20 22:54 - Lorena: Ahhh es que estoy viendo que en España son 30 eur
22/6/20 22:55 - Lorena: Pero el mío en el consulado uruguayo son 100eu jaja
22/6/20 22:55 - Lorena: Igual 50 dol. por todo está bien
22/6/20 22:56 - Joe: Hopefully it's only 50 total. I'm looking online and supposedly i have to pay more for the booklet or whatever
22/6/20 22:56 - Joe: We'll see
22/6/20 22:56 - Joe: At least i got that money from Andrew Yang to pay for it hahaha
22/6/20 23:01 - Lorena: Jajaja
22/6/20 23:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 23:02 - Lorena: Bueno 50 no es nada caro!
22/6/20 23:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 23:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 23:06 - Joe: Hahah siii muchooo tiempo

22/6/20 23:09 - Joe: Hahahah
22/6/20 23:09 - Joe: Yes I believe it will be before you are 32. How long can it really be delayed??
22/6/20 23:10 - Joe: Hopefully only a few weeks extra. I’ll have to buy an expensive ticket when I finally get the passport so I can come right away though hahaha
22/6/20 23:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 23:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

22/6/20 23:16 - Lorena: No boludo, esperemos que te lo den antes.. si no...no importa!
22/6/20 23:17 - Joe: You just have to come visit me. I’m sure you can sneak over here for a quick visit 😂
22/6/20 23:18 - Joe: Nah but I’ll get there. I’m sorry for making you wait haha
22/6/20 23:19 - Lorena: Jajaja buuu
22/6/20 23:19 - Lorena: Jaja tonto!!! No me digas eso.. encima de que venís... Lo valoro un montón!

22/6/20 23:24 - Joe: I’m really looking forward to seeing you. It sucks that it’ll take so long but we’ll get there eventually.
22/6/20 23:25 - Joe: I have a lot to figure out though too. How long do I go for? Will I stay with you? What if you end up hating me? Do I go back to the US after?
22/6/20 23:26 - Joe: There is a lot of complications with international travel
22/6/20 23:26 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
22/6/20 23:26 - Joe: Whatever, I’ll figure it out eventually haha

22/6/20 23:33 - Joe: Ugh I failed to find a good gif haha. But yeah I’m sure we’ll probably need the translator sometimes.
22/6/20 23:33 - Lorena: Sisi this shit hella smackinnnn dulce de lechee
22/6/20 23:34 - Joe: I’m trying to be fluent in Spanish regardless of what happens so I’m going to keep learning. I’m still watching shows in spanish and listening to spanish music. There is a lot to learn
22/6/20 23:35 - Lorena: Me alegro! Pensé que ya no lo hacías jaja solo en Hawaii
22/6/20 23:35 - Lorena: Jaja todas esas preguntas no las sé, yo también las pienso

22/6/20 23:44 - Joe: Now I don’t know how to greet you. You’re making me nervous hahaha I’m not supposed to think about these things. I just go with the flow or whatever haha
22/6/20 23:44 - Joe: Shit
22/6/20 23:45 - Lorena: Si claro esto es ir con la corriente jajaja
22/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: Te saludaré cordial para que no me hagas como Bean... Además no te gusta que te toquen jaja

22/6/20 23:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/6/20 23:52 - Lorena: 🤐
22/6/20 23:52 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
22/6/20 23:52 - Lorena: Te imaginas?
22/6/20 23:52 - Joe: Hahaha I’ll be at the airport looking for you but you’ll be gone 😂
22/6/20 23:52 - Lorena: No, noooooo!
22/6/20 23:52 - Joe: 🏎

22/6/20 23:55 - Lorena: Jaja ninguno de los dos es serio jaja divertido
22/6/20 23:57 - Lorena: Ay no sé jaja te lo juro es rarísimo para mí, intento pensar cosas.. pero imagínate que no quiero que te vayass! 🙊 eso sería terrible
22/6/20 23:59 - Joe: Haha yeah but I think I’m only allowed to go for 90 days unless I apply for something specific. Or even if I want to work there or whatever. It’s all different stuff I have to do. I don’t know it’s complicated.
23/6/20 0:00 - Joe: But what I do depends a lot on what you want. When I buy my ticket I’ll need to know what I should be planning for I guess. Haha I don’t know it’s hard to explain. I don’t need all the details but a general idea of what you want would be nice.
23/6/20 0:01 - Joe: I don’t want to come barging into your life in a way you didn’t want
23/6/20 0:01 - Lorena: Jajaja
23/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: Eso es una risa nerviosa
23/6/20 0:02 - Lorena: Jaja y está también

23/6/20 0:04 - Lorena: Quiero que estés bien y sea una experiencia linda para vos
23/6/20 0:06 - Joe: Haha we'll figure it all out later i guess. Got to get my passport first.
23/6/20 0:07 - Joe: I doubt i'll get bored with you though, especially after only 3 months. It will be hard to leave you i'm sure 🥺
23/6/20 0:41 - Lorena: Ey había llegado Sandri y Luchi

23/6/20 21:59 - Joe: I’m nervous that I’m going to not have something I need haha. It’s ok. If I’m missing something I’ll make another appointment for tomorrow 😂

24/6/20 0:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 0:23 - Lorena: Jajaj Yaa! Estaría bien saberlo antes.. de todos modos no puedo creer como tardan tanto ahí
24/6/20 0:23 - Lorena: 6 veces más que acá jaja

24/6/20 0:31 - Lorena: En cuánto llegas, 20min?
24/6/20 0:32 - Joe: Maybe 30min. I have to pick you up a surprise on the way haha
24/6/20 0:34 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/6/20 0:34 - Lorena: Ah sí, cuál? Digo por si no llegas en esos 30min jaja
24/6/20 0:35 - Joe: Hahah I can’t tell you or it wouldn’t be a surprise 🎁
24/6/20 0:36 - Joe: Ok maybe I won’t be there in 30 haha. I can’t wait for that to be true though. So close!
24/6/20 0:37 - Lorena: Jaja en 30 min entonces sin vosy sin sorpresa
24/6/20 0:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 0:39 - Joe: Hahahaha
24/6/20 0:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 0:39 - Lorena: Jajaj
24/6/20 0:40 - Lorena: Estuviste alguna vez con algún chico también?
24/6/20 0:42 - Joe: Like in bed? No I haven’t
24/6/20 0:43 - Joe: I hope I understood that question right cause that was hella random haha
24/6/20 0:43 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/6/20 0:43 - Lorena: 😅🙊 soy un poco random
24/6/20 0:44 - Lorena: Me refería a si te gustan los chicos también o solo chicas
24/6/20 0:45 - Joe: Oh haha just girls
24/6/20 0:47 - Joe: What about youuu? Do you also like girls or just boys?
24/6/20 0:47 - Lorena: Solo chicos!
24/6/20 0:48 - Lorena: Y mucho jaja
24/6/20 0:48 - Joe: Haha ok. Interesting questions 😂 😂
24/6/20 0:48 - Joe: Hahahah
24/6/20 0:48 - Lorena: Jaja si, me vino a la cabeza jaja antes de que te compres un vuelo o algo de eso jajaja
24/6/20 0:48 - Joe: What am I getting into? Hahaha
24/6/20 0:49 - Joe: Hahah we’ll make sure you ask all the questions you need to before it’s too late
24/6/20 0:49 - Joe: Did I answer correctly?? 😆
24/6/20 0:51 - Lorena: Respeto la homosexualidad, la igualdad, etc de hecho tengo amigas y amigos y cada uno es libre.. ( no me entiendas mal) pero la verdad... que no me gustaría un chico que le gusten los hombres... Jaja
24/6/20 0:51 - Joe: Haha ok ok that makes sense.
24/6/20 0:52 - Joe: Don’t worry I’m all about girls only 😂
24/6/20 0:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Jajajaj
24/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Vale bien! Menos mal jaja
24/6/20 0:53 - Lorena: Tendría que superar que me gustes y te gusten los chicos también eso sería tremendo para mí jajaja
24/6/20 0:55 - Lorena: Aunque entiendo que el contrario puede ser diferente.. Me refiero si me gustasen las chicas también te gustaría o no?
24/6/20 0:57 - Joe: Haha this makes me wonder if I gave you a reason to think that I would like guys in the first place
24/6/20 0:57 - Joe: It’s not my preferred situation but it wouldn’t be a deal breaker i guess
24/6/20 0:58 - Joe: As long as you like me at the moment, I don’t see why I should care if you like girls too 🤷‍♂️
24/6/20 1:00 - Lorena: Noooo, ninguna! Jaja simplemente me vino a la cabeza y lo pregunté por las dudas
24/6/20 1:00 - Joe: i’m not into like open relationships or whatever either. So if I like you, you’re the one person I like in that way.
24/6/20 1:01 - Lorena: Pero no creo que pueda estar con un chico bisexual. Podría dejar de gustarme, aunque esto es lo que pienso, luego no sé si sería tan así.. nunca me pasó jaja
24/6/20 1:02 - Joe: Haha ok I was also going to ask if you’ve been in that situation before or something.
24/6/20 1:03 - Joe: It’s fine though, I’m not bisexual so you won’t have that problem with me
24/6/20 1:03 - Lorena: Nada, tranqui...cero! Jaja los hombres son super liiindos, las chicas nada en ese sentido( para mí)
24/6/20 1:04 - Lorena: Jajaj mis amigas se reirían si se enteran que estoy preguntando esto jaja tan aleatoria
24/6/20 1:05 - Joe: Hahahaha I’ll tell them about it someday
24/6/20 1:06 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/6/20 1:07 - Lorena: Bueno dejando este asunto ya resuelto, que sepas que me hace mucha ilusión que hayas tramitado hoy parte del pasaporte
24/6/20 1:09 - Lorena: You make me happy with these details, kind stranger! 🤗
24/6/20 1:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 1:14 - Joe: Hahah that gif was lame
24/6/20 1:15 - Joe: But yeah, no problem. I’m just trying to keep you in the loop so you don’t get tired of waiting and start to think I’ll never come
24/6/20 1:15 - Joe: Cause I’m coming haha
24/6/20 1:17 - Lorena: Jaja ya me conoces algo!!
24/6/20 1:18 - Lorena: Tonto hone 😣
24/6/20 1:24 - Joe: Sometimes I wonder if you think I won’t come
24/6/20 1:28 - Lorena: Jaja no, al principio cuando me lo planteabas me costaba creerte
24/6/20 1:30 - Lorena: Pero claro no sabía que seguiríamos en contacto tantos días y que me ibas a gustar tanto jaja 🙊🤐
24/6/20 1:31 - Lorena: Ahora sé que si, un poco más cerca. Pero si no te pudiese conocer, me jodería bastante jaja pero bueno
24/6/20 1:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 1:43 - Joe: Me alegro de que no huyera cuando empecé a hablar de verte jajaja, pero ¿qué más se suponía que debía hacer? no quería hablar para siempre y nunca conocer.
24/6/20 1:46 - Lorena: Jaja sí, tenés razón ... Es lo lógico. Pero en mi mente no estaba tomarlo enserio jaja me parecía casi imposible
24/6/20 1:53 - Joe: jaja será difícil, pero no imposible. y espero que también sea divertido. pero puedo entender que no me creas al principio. parece un poco loco
24/6/20 1:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 2:38 - Lorena: Jajaja
24/6/20 2:38 - Lorena: Me quedé dormida, estoy en la cama mm
24/6/20 2:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 2:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 7:49 - Lorena: Jaja no me acuerdo de haber enviado ese audio
24/6/20 8:03 - Joe: Hahaha you must’ve been so tired when you sent it. I appreciate it.
24/6/20 8:18 - Lorena: Jaja sii
24/6/20 8:19 - Lorena: Dormí desnuda y con el ventilador al lado toda la noche, que calooooorr
24/6/20 8:35 - Joe: Mmmm well I’m glad you think of me when you’re sleeping naked in your bed hahaha
24/6/20 8:46 - Joe: I forgot to tell you that some kid smacked his chin on the ground today at camp 😬 luckily he didn’t knock out any teeth or anything like that. He just had a cut and bump on his chin. I always forget about the injuries that happen at skate camp
24/6/20 8:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 9:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 9:01 - Lorena: Que vaga soy jaja me quedo en la cama siempre un buen rato, me despierto pronto pero no me gusta levantarme rápido
24/6/20 9:02 - Lorena: Uuuh jaja pobre nene.. hubo alguna lesión grave?
24/6/20 9:03 - Lorena: Que divino jaja cómo se da con el pie jjj
24/6/20 9:06 - Joe: Mmmm holaaa! Hahaha
24/6/20 9:07 - Joe: It wasn’t bad enough to need to go to the hospital or anything but hitting your chin on the ground always sucks. His dad came and picked him up early. He definitely took a solid hit
24/6/20 9:09 - Lorena: Que dolor golpearte ahí
24/6/20 9:09 - Lorena: Cuál esa la zona que más odias golpearte?
24/6/20 9:14 - Joe: Hmm I guess I hate when I sprain my ankle the most haha.
24/6/20 9:16 - Joe: I’ve done it so many times now. It sucks. I also hate getting hit in the shin. That sucks and is super common.
24/6/20 9:17 - Lorena: Jaja sí la espinilla da grima golpearte ahí!
24/6/20 9:19 - Lorena: Cuando empezaste a grabar?
24/6/20 9:19 - Lorena: *Empezás

24/6/20 9:21 - Joe: Ooooh for the new video

24/6/20 21:25 - Joe: I’m free! I’m about to drive home now. Made it through the day without anyone getting too hurt haha
24/6/20 21:28 - Lorena: Yo libre también, pero en el metro 🚇
24/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: Bien papi profe todos sanos!
24/6/20 21:37 - Joe: Our public transportation is so trash haha. It would take me forever to get home if I didn’t drive.
24/6/20 21:38 - Lorena: Si? Cuánto tiempo en auto y cuánto en .. metro, bus, tren? Jaja
24/6/20 21:40 - Lorena: Acá en Madrid el transporte es bueno, es una locura ir en auto.. en la sierra yo si me movía en coche pq era todo mucho más rápido en 15 minutos estaba en la casa de mis amigas y en bus 1hr.. pero son pueblo de sierra entonces no hay tanta frecuencia y paradas
24/6/20 21:41 - Joe: 30 minutes driving but probably 1 or 2 hours with public transportation. Either a train and bus or two busses
24/6/20 21:41 - Lorena: 😱😱😱
24/6/20 21:42 - Lorena: Muchoo
24/6/20 21:46 - Lorena: Igual me gustaría vivir en un lugar donde pueda moverme en bicicleta, caminando..una motito o coche transporte corto.. ese es uno de mis deseos para elegir un lugar para vivir en un tiempo.. no me gusta el metro .. aunque vaya rápido jaja
24/6/20 21:49 - Joe: Haha yeah same. I was really enjoying life without a car in Hawaii. Everything I needed was close enough I could just skate everywhere
24/6/20 21:51 - Lorena: Jaja
24/6/20 21:51 - Lorena: Vos con el skate yo con una bici con canasto ☝️
24/6/20 21:58 - Joe: Hahaha sounds like a plan
24/6/20 21:58 - Joe: Is it more typical to use public transportation than to drive your own car around where you live?
24/6/20 22:01 - Lorena: Si
24/6/20 22:02 - Lorena: En Madrid, en el centro de la ciudad transporte público. En las afueras, pueblitos, depende donde.. pero auto mejor
24/6/20 22:04 - Lorena: Yo tuve solo un auto.. se me rompió hace unos meses.. era viejo y me encantaba, se lo compré a un señor que había sido su único coche y lo cuidaba como si fuese el "Gran Torino", el tenía un diario
24/6/20 22:05 - Lorena: Era un Renault 19 del año 95, era un coche que acá en España era típico hace mil años.. jaja ahora no.. pero yo lo tuve hasta hace poco.. mis amigas se reían de mi..
24/6/20 22:05 - Lorena: Le puse nombre, Ramoncito. Jaja por su antiguo dueño, me dio mucha pena. Pero el coche no consumía nada, era cómodo con su asiento de terciopelo jaja y tenía más maletero que el de mis amigas jajaja
24/6/20 22:06 - Lorena: Jaja no paro de hablar de él, jaja no sé cómo no te hablé antes.. pobre Ramoncito 🚗
24/6/20 22:07 - Joe: Hahah romancitoooo https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDcxNTI1MzExMDEzNjA5?igshid=l79aoy7fh4k7&story_media_id=2214225930074223088
24/6/20 22:08 - Joe: Aaah it didn’t send you to the right one hahaha but I remember it from the videos in your story. You starting the car 😂 what happened to the car? It finally died?
24/6/20 22:08 - Lorena: Ahhhhh jajaja
24/6/20 22:08 - Lorena: Ramoncito!!! Sisii ahí estaba intentando arrancarlo jajaj siempre bombeando
24/6/20 22:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 22:09 - Lorena: Pero esa vez hacia frío y le costaba más.. siempre tenía que abrir el capó bombear la gasolina varías d veces y luego con el pie hasta que arrancaba
24/6/20 22:10 - Lorena: Jjajajajaja 🙊
24/6/20 22:10 - Joe: You look so happy when it starts hahah. Very cute
24/6/20 22:11 - Lorena: Jajaja si si, mucho!
24/6/20 22:11 - Lorena: Me fui de viaje a Valencia sola con el coche lleno de cosas para hacer unas fotos de un proyecto
24/6/20 22:12 - Lorena: Como a 4hs de Madrid y me quedé tirada en un viaducto por la noche y con temporal. Pasé miedo justo en una curva a oscuras.. y por suerte pudo venir la grúa
24/6/20 22:14 - Lorena: Al parecer estaba muerto pero volvió a Madrid y en mi taller me lo arreglaron pero ese día por la noche al parecer no estaba tan arreglado jaja.. a las semanas dio problemas así que lo llevé al desguace 😭 y me vine a Madrid
24/6/20 22:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/6/20 22:21 - Joe: Damn poor car. At least it lived a long life though haha 25 years is a long time for a car.
24/6/20 22:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

27/6/20 9:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/6/20 9:06 - Lorena: Jajaj pero como es ese coche? Pq no sabes conducirlo?
27/6/20 9:09 - Joe: It’s a stick shift. I’ve only driven auto. My first time driving a manual transmission was a few days ago when he let me drive that car haha
27/6/20 9:10 - Joe: I figured it out quick. I learned already how to drive a stick shift in a video game and it was about the same. But next I have to learn how to slide the car. That’s going to be hella fun. He keeps trying to convince me to buy my own drift car but I don’t want to haha
27/6/20 9:11 - Lorena: Ahhhh
27/6/20 9:12 - Lorena: Espera que ahí es automático claro, no conducen con marchas?
27/6/20 9:12 - Lorena: No sé si estoy entendiendo jajaj no sabes coneucir con palanca de cambios?

27/6/20 9:15 - Joe: Haha yeah his car has a manual gearshift
27/6/20 9:16 - Lorena: Jajaj sabes que acá son casi todos manuales no?
27/6/20 9:16 - Joe: Every car I’ve had has been automatic
27/6/20 9:16 - Lorena: Si llegamos a alquilar alguno... Jajaja te toca
27/6/20 9:17 - Joe: Good thing I learned now haha
27/6/20 9:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/6/20 9:17 - Joe: There is probably a lot of good drift cars near you then
27/6/20 9:18 - Joe: Hahaha damn now I want to get my drifting down before i meet you.
27/6/20 9:18 - Joe: So I can scare the shit out of you by sliding the car around
27/6/20 9:19 - Lorena: Jajajaj
27/6/20 9:20 - Lorena: Mierda me va a tocar a mí 🙊🙈
27/6/20 9:20 - Lorena: Yo te iba a decir que te traigas tu carnet de conducir jaja pero no había caído en ese pequeño gran detalle
27/6/20 9:23 - Lorena: Que es "drift" me sale significado deriva. No lo entiendo cuando utilizas drift car
27/6/20 9:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/6/20 9:29 - Lorena: La casa de una amiga, me gusta la onda que tienen..muchas plantas..patio.. que eso es difícil en Madrid
27/6/20 9:30 - Lorena: Hay cosas de la calle y cosas de personas que ya vivieron en la casa de diferentes nacionalidades pero me parece acogedora jaja
27/6/20 9:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/6/20 9:35 - Joe: I will definitely bring my driving license haha
27/6/20 9:36 - Lorena: Derrapar! 🤣
27/6/20 9:37 - Joe: Yeah that place looks really nice. I like the patio.
27/6/20 9:38 - Joe: Hahah I’ll have to add that to my notebook. But yeah it’s a controlled skid. Well....hopefully it’s controlled 😂
27/6/20 9:39 - Lorena: Tienen otro patio con zanahorias, tomates, etc 😍
27/6/20 9:40 - Joe: Damn that’s hella sick. It’s like in the city too? Not just outside the city or something?
27/6/20 9:40 - Lorena: Siguen apareciendo cosas tan diferentes en nuestros estilos de vida jaja
27/6/20 9:42 - Lorena: Es en la ciudad, cerca de mi casa. Pero no es centro centro..acá Madrid es que tiene mucho piso, ni hay taaanto con jardín
27/6/20 9:43 - Lorena: Ahí el video que me pasaste de Kyle se ve lindo.las casas tienen jardín.aca son más edificios
27/6/20 9:47 - Joe: Yeah it’s a suburban area so lots of houses. It’s an ok little neighborhood, not the best haha but not the worst either
27/6/20 10:06 - Lorena: Cuánto cuesta un alquiler ahí por ejemplo?
27/6/20 10:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

27/6/20 10:13 - Joe: I believe it’s like $1800, maybe a little more, for their 2 bedroom 1 bathroom. They live in one half of a duplex.
27/6/20 10:14 - Lorena: Con jardín también, no está mal.
27/6/20 10:15 - Joe: No not at all. Like i said it’s not the best neighborhood, it can be a little sketchy in that area. But the block he lives on is chill
27/6/20 10:17 - Joe: The architecture near you is way cooler than what’s around here haha
27/6/20 10:17 - Joe: Yeah I’m getting tired. I’ll probably fall asleep really soon
27/6/20 10:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/6/20 10:21 - Lorena: Si, Madrid y BCN tienen buena arquitectura

27/6/20 19:55 - Joe: Hahaha our first video call will be a bunch of “uuuuuuh mmmmm hmmmm” 😂 I really don’t mind the challenge. Even if I don’t understand a single word you say I’ll still enjoy our call I’m sure.
27/6/20 19:56 - Joe: But yeah, one step at a time. Have to get that passport. My excitement is building as the days go by. It feels like we’re getting close haha
27/6/20 23:41 - Lorena: Perdón bombón estaba con mis amigas
27/6/20 23:42 - Lorena: En un bar al aire libre (terraza)
27/6/20 23:44 - Lorena: Jajajaja síii, por un lado tengo ganas pero por otro me da pena si luego quiero estar contigo y te veo tan lejos jajaja
27/6/20 23:46 - Lorena: Yo tambiénnn, el otro día miré a cuánto estaban los vuelos desde San Francisco jjj fechas
27/6/20 23:58 - Joe: No worries. I’m working on the “drift car” again haha.
28/6/20 0:01 - Joe: How much were flights? Super expensive? I haven’t been looking. Just saving my money. I already know I’m going to have to spend a lot for a ticket most likely
28/6/20 0:05 - Joe: Just let me know when you’re ready for a video chat and we can make it happen hahah
28/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: Jaja sí??? Me tenés que mostrar esa habilidad
28/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: De drift car jaja digo
28/6/20 0:06 - Lorena: Noo, yo no voy a dejar que compres uno caro jajaj aunque tenga ganas de verte
28/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: Igual soy buena buscadora de ofertas 😉
28/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: Mmm San Francisco Madrid algunos eran 800eu
28/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: Pero había muchos de 600
28/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: E incluso yo encontré algunos de 400!
28/6/20 0:10 - Joe: I won’t tell you the cost lol I
28/6/20 0:10 - Joe: 😂
28/6/20 0:11 - Joe: You found good deals. You need to come see me instead hahah
28/6/20 0:11 - Joe: Or when it’s time for me to get a ticket you can find me a good deal too. That would work
28/6/20 0:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 0:14 - Joe: Hahahaha
28/6/20 0:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 0:16 - Joe: Niiiice not bad at all. They better let me go see you haha
28/6/20 0:17 - Joe: I was thinking that it might be a good idea for me to have a drink or two before I chat with you 😂 we can drink beers together over a video chat hahaha
28/6/20 0:18 - Lorena: Jajajaja
28/6/20 0:19 - Lorena: Eso seguro, no lo dudes
28/6/20 0:21 - Lorena: Yo quiero que seas real jajaja, delante...
28/6/20 0:23 - Lorena: Poder sentirte, olerte, tocarte, empujarte o abrazarte jaja eso por una vídeollamada no se puede jjjj
28/6/20 0:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 0:34 - Joe: Hahah I understand. We’ve already talked plenty through messages anyway and I feel like I’ve gotten to know you a lot. I’m definitely more interested in what it’s like to actually be with you in person
28/6/20 11:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 11:16 - Lorena: Sii al final llevamos mucho tiempo hablando, fue casi al principio de cuarentena en España .. marzo! 💙
28/6/20 11:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 11:20 - Lorena: Llevo unos días durmiendo fuera, jaja duermo super bien...pero la espalda me duele un poco cuando no duermo en mi cama
28/6/20 17:26 - Joe: Holaaaa
28/6/20 17:29 - Joe: Damn 3 months already?? It goes by fast. 

That breakfast looks hella good. It’s time for me to have breakfast now haha.
28/6/20 17:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 17:31 - Lorena: Jaja estaba trabajando justo ahora en el metro de camino a mí casa, hoy pienso tirarme en el sofá y no moverme jajaj
28/6/20 17:31 - Lorena: Si, 3 meses hablando todos los días jaja. Literal
28/6/20 17:36 - Joe: Hahah niiiice
28/6/20 17:37 - Joe: Let me join you 😂
28/6/20 17:41 - Joe: That’s so wild. I never imagined talking to you for so long or planning to see you when you first messaged me. But I’m happy about it now. We only missed like 1 day talking to each other in all that time haha. Not bad.
28/6/20 18:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 18:21 - Lorena: Jajaja un flechazo a la distanciaaa. Si es verdad, solo un día. Me acuerdo jaja
28/6/20 18:43 - Joe: Junk food and beer 😋
28/6/20 18:46 - Joe: I would love to join you for a movie. We would probably get “distracted” or fall asleep before the end of the movie 😂
28/6/20 18:46 - Joe: But I’d enjoy that
28/6/20 19:52 - Lorena: Buff me encantaría
28/6/20 19:58 - Lorena: Acabo de despertarme jaja me quedé dormida en el sofá
28/6/20 19:59 - Lorena: Que hacés pinocho? Me apetece hablar contigo
28/6/20 20:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:01 - Joe: Whoops I meant to reply to the next message haha. Oh well 🤷‍♂️
28/6/20 20:01 - Joe: I’m cleaning right now but I was thinking about getting something to eat soon. I had eggs and toast for breakfast earlier but I’m still hungry.
28/6/20 20:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:04 - Lorena: 😅🙏
28/6/20 20:05 - Lorena: Jaja que gordiii
28/6/20 20:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:07 - Joe: Hahhhhaha shiiiit
28/6/20 20:08 - Joe: I noticed your meals are usually pretty small. I can’t lie, I eat a lot sometimes hahaha but it all gets burned off from skating so it’s cool
28/6/20 20:09 - Lorena: Mis comidas pequeñas? Jajaja yo como todo el tiempo, me encanta
28/6/20 20:10 - Lorena: Comes mucho? Pensé que no tanto! Sos flaquito
28/6/20 20:13 - Joe: Haha 🤷‍♂️ that’s what it looks like when you send videos or pictures of your meals to me.
28/6/20 20:14 - Joe: But good to know it’s not what it seems like haha
28/6/20 20:14 - Joe: I love food
28/6/20 20:15 - Joe: Yeah I eat a lot. Especially when I’m doing a lot of skating. 

What are you doooing?
28/6/20 20:20 - Lorena: Jajaj mmm puede ser que me haya comido algo ya, o que lo combine luego con algo más, o depende el tipo de comida que sea
28/6/20 20:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:21 - Lorena: Tirada en el sofá con el ventilador al lado jajaja
28/6/20 20:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:34 - Joe: Hahah that’s hella cute. I need to teach my dog cool tricks when I get one 🐕
28/6/20 20:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/6/20 20:38 - Lorena: Jaja que perro te gustaría tener?
28/6/20 20:39 - Lorena: A las 11:30 de la mañana? 😯 Jajaj
28/6/20 20:42 - Joe: Socks hahaha
28/6/20 20:43 - Joe: But honestly I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it too much. I’ll know when I see the dog haha
28/6/20 20:44 - Joe: Hahaha 🙈
28/6/20 21:01 - Lorena: Socks parece una buena perra, creo que yo también la querría jaja
28/6/20 21:03 - Lorena: Si no sé, tamaño,cualidades..alguna raza o sin raza, algo que te guste, como cola, orejas, etc jaja me refiero a algo que te haga gracia que lo veas y digas ohh
28/6/20 21:03 - Lorena: Todos son geniales, pero por ejemplo a mí me encantan las colas largas o las orejas también graciosas
28/6/20 21:06 - Lorena: Cariñosos o más independientes, que les guste el agua o no, etc jaja a Rogel por ej. no le gusta el agua 😒
28/6/20 21:14 - Joe: Hmmm I like medium sized short hair dogs. Interesting coloration of the fur is cool to me. I’ll have to pay more attention to what makes me like dogs when I see them.
28/6/20 21:15 - Joe: I do like long tail instead of the little stump tail. And funny ears too. I was having too much fun playing with Sock’a ears cause one is floppy and the other stands up straight
28/6/20 21:17 - Joe: I like an affectionate dog but not to the point where they get overly needy for attention. A nice balance haha
28/6/20 21:27 - Lorena: Estas eran las respuestas que quería cuando te hacía la pregunta jajaj
28/6/20 21:27 - Lorena: Si te gustan los perros habrá pequeños detalles que pueden gustarte más que otros
28/6/20 21:28 - Lorena: Ví esa oreja de socks, la que se queda parada jaja 😍
28/6/20 21:30 - Lorena: Me gustan de pelo largo pero no me gusta estar llena de pelos en la ropa.. y me gustaria que pueda subir al sofá o dormir en mi cama, para eso es necesario pelo corto. Me duele mucho cuando lola no puede subir por ese motivo jaja pero intento darle amor desde el suelo... O pongo muchas mantas y algún día sube
28/6/20 22:00 - Joe: Haha that’s why I like short hair. So they can be close to me without shedding too much everywhere.
28/6/20 22:01 - Joe: Haha whoops
28/6/20 22:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 0:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 0:50 - Joe: Hahah buenos noches 🛌
29/6/20 16:40 - Joe: Holaaaaa! I’m leaving to camp in a little bit and I have an interview for a temporary position doing some programming work later. Hopefully I get the coding job, it pays really good! Wish me luck haha
29/6/20 16:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 16:43 - Lorena: Hola! Ah sí? Y eso cómo salió? Que bienn
29/6/20 16:44 - Lorena: No necesitas suerte, lo harás bien seguro. Pero si te hace falta te mando toda la suerte del mundo jaja
29/6/20 16:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 16:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 16:47 - Lorena: Yo volviendo a casa caminando,hace tanto calor que creo que estoy agarrando color en la piel jaja
29/6/20 16:49 - Joe: Haha trust me I need it 😂 but thank you!
29/6/20 16:49 - Joe: It looks so nice out there. Also, there’s a lot of parks around the city it seems like
29/6/20 16:50 - Joe: 🍅
29/6/20 16:52 - Lorena: Pero y trabajarías en un sitio fijo o sería a distancia?
29/6/20 16:53 - Lorena: Lo que no sepas lo aprendes, así que vos sonreí y decí que estás súper implicado
29/6/20 16:54 - Lorena: 🤛 seep
29/6/20 16:55 - Lorena: Tomate voy a estar el viernes que me voy a la montaña con mis amigas a bañarme en unos charquitos
29/6/20 16:55 - Joe: I can work from a distance. “Remote work” or whatever.
29/6/20 16:55 - Joe: Haha true. Thanks for the advice.
29/6/20 16:56 - Lorena: Si trabajas a distancia siempre podés aprender en casa las cosas que no estés seguro
29/6/20 16:56 - Joe: Oh I can’t wait to see the pictures after you get back 😂 🍅
29/6/20 16:57 - Joe: Yeah I’m confident in my ability to learn the technology for the project. It’s similar to what I’ve worked with before.
29/6/20 16:58 - Joe: Oh I forgot to tell you how i got it. I actually know the guy from a class I took a few years ago. He messaged me on LinkedIn about the position
29/6/20 16:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 16:59 - Lorena: Muy bien, seguridad, empatía  y motivación. Eso en las entrevistas siempre funciona jaja
29/6/20 17:01 - Joe: Haha be careful in the sun. You’re going to get toasted 😂
29/6/20 17:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 17:04 - Joe: I’m pretty confident about this one since he approached me and he knows me from a class but we’ll see 🤷‍♂️
29/6/20 17:04 - Joe: 😂 😂
29/6/20 17:05 - Lorena: A que hora la tenés?
29/6/20 17:07 - Joe: Around 1
29/6/20 17:07 - Joe: I’m going to work now so I’ll be driving. Barely going to make it on time haha. I hope you’re having a great day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
29/6/20 17:08 - Lorena: Suerte!! Yo acabo de llegar a casa y voy a comer un pollo delicioso!!!! Que hice hoy a las 8AM jaja
29/6/20 17:09 - Lorena: 😘
29/6/20 20:50 - Joe: I’m almost free haha. I’m so tired and hungry. I’m going to eat, talk to the guy about the job, and probably take a nap. I had zero energy today for some reason
29/6/20 21:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/6/20 21:54 - Lorena: "Hola, bueno te mando un audio para desearte mucha suerte para la entrevista que seguro que te va a salir genial y si no, no pasa nada.. bueno después me contás cómo te fue, un besito lindo chau!"
29/6/20 22:47 - Joe: It went pretty good! He said he will email me later with more details. But it sounds like a cool gig. $1500/week to code 1-2 features every 2 weeks. All remote work so I can work from anywhere. I hope this works out. It would be perfect
29/6/20 23:09 - Lorena: Que biennn
29/6/20 23:11 - Lorena: 1500 dol por semana o cada dos semanas? Es muchísimo!
29/6/20 23:22 - Joe: $1500 every week. So $6000/month. But that’s before taxes. And doing the math it’s about $78,000/year which isn’t great for software developers but I’ll take it haha. Something to pad the resume with so I can get the big money later. Writing code pays really well, it’s just hard to find work sometimes.
29/6/20 23:24 - Joe: We’ll see what happens. Hopefully it works out. I still have to learn some new technologies I haven’t worked with. Ooooh I’m excited haha
30/6/20 0:04 - Lorena: Bombón!!!!
30/6/20 0:05 - Lorena: Cuánto me alegro!!!!!
30/6/20 0:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 0:12 - Lorena: Esta muy bien pagado!!! Además ganarás más experiencia!
30/6/20 0:13 - Lorena: Mierda perdona no haberte respondido rápido cuando lo leí , quería felicitarte mejor!
30/6/20 0:14 - Joe: Thank you thank you! 😊
30/6/20 0:15 - Joe: Haha no worries I was eating
30/6/20 0:17 - Lorena: Y cuando empezas a trabajar?
30/6/20 0:20 - Joe: He didn’t email me yet but I’m assuming it would be in a week or two.
30/6/20 0:20 - Joe: I’m going to keep myself from getting too excited in case he never emails me 😂
30/6/20 0:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 0:21 - Lorena: Te lo va a enviaaarrr
30/6/20 0:22 - Lorena: Lo hiciste bien si no, te diría que lo pensará...pero te dijo que te va a enviar un correo
30/6/20 0:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 0:22 - Lorena: Que bien, me alegroo de verdad!
30/6/20 0:23 - Lorena: Y por cuánto tiempo sería?
30/6/20 0:24 - Joe: You’re probably right. He wouldn’t tell me he would email me if he wasn’t going to.
30/6/20 0:25 - Joe: I don’t know for how long. Seemed like an ongoing project. I’ll have to see what the contract looks like that he sends
30/6/20 0:25 - Lorena: Ahhh
30/6/20 0:26 - Lorena: Y cuántas horas trabajarás por día?
30/6/20 0:26 - Lorena: Y cómo es el tipo de trabajo, son webs o es otra cosa de codificación? Jaja 🙄
30/6/20 0:27 - Joe: It’s not really going to have hours per day. More like, get the work done within 2 weeks. Work however long and whenever you need to so you can finish it
30/6/20 0:28 - Joe: Haha it’s an app for IOS and Android
30/6/20 0:28 - Lorena: Ahhh y de qué es la app?
30/6/20 0:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 0:32 - Joe: It’s some music app or something like that.
30/6/20 0:34 - Joe: Not too sure. It’s something about music recommendations and it will work with different music apps. I don’t know. He didn’t explain it super well but it sounded interesting
30/6/20 8:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 12:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 15:18 - Lorena: Miss you too, estaría bien poder coincidir para hablar un poco más que desearnos los buenos días o buenas noches jaja
30/6/20 15:20 - Lorena: I'm proud that you got that job....and if it is remote better haha
30/6/20 16:12 - Joe: Hahah I’m definitely trying to talk more than just good morning and goodnight!
30/6/20 16:12 - Joe: Thanks babe. I’m stoked.
30/6/20 16:15 - Joe: I need to start waking up earlier again. Then I can talk to you in the mornings for longer before I go to work. I’ve been lazy lately, waking up at the last minute
30/6/20 16:15 - Joe: And I always fall asleep right around the time you wake up haha
30/6/20 16:16 - Lorena: Jaja y yo m quedó dormida justo cuando estás libre
30/6/20 16:16 - Lorena: Quedo*
30/6/20 16:16 - Lorena: Es que no puedo controlarlo hoy fue como mierda jaja otra vez
30/6/20 16:16 - Lorena: 🤗
30/6/20 16:17 - Lorena: Joe estoy deprimida si nos vuelven a encerrar en Madrid que hay rumores de un "rebrote" no vas a poder venir 😭
30/6/20 16:18 - Lorena: Jaja 🥺
30/6/20 16:19 - Joe: Hah yeah our schedules our messed up right now. I’ll do better though
30/6/20 16:19 - Joe: Today was shit? What happened?

30/6/20 16:24 - Joe: I better get there by August haha

30/6/20 16:33 - Joe: So it’s perfect
30/6/20 16:34 - Joe: I have Apple Music and they make a favorite playlist every week. This week is the first time they added some of the spanish music you sent me haha. I must be listening to it a lot
30/6/20 16:36 - Lorena: Jaja perfecto no sería, estarías encerrado en tu viaje . Eso es tremendo
30/6/20 16:36 - Lorena: Bueno veremos que pasa..tengo ganas que te den el pasaporte aunque sea solo x verlo jaja
30/6/20 16:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
30/6/20 16:37 - Lorena: Ah síii? Jaja cuáles te agregó super Apple? 👀
30/6/20 16:45 - Joe: Haha yeah we’ll see. If I make it to you first, then they can reimplement the quarantine as long as they want 😂
30/6/20 16:45 - Joe: Mmmm 😋
30/6/20 16:46 - Joe: They put a song by Los Delinqüentes. Tartarichi. I listen to their album a lot haha
30/6/20 16:53 - Lorena: 😂

30/6/20 16:56 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
30/6/20 17:00 - Joe: I was wondering when Apple was going to start recommending music in spanish haha
30/6/20 17:03 - Joe: I’m going to work now. I’m doing a 12 hour shift again but I can still talk to you during the shift. I don’t do much while I monitor the park.
30/6/20 17:04 - Joe: Promise I’ll start getting up a little earlier so we can talk more. I miss talking to you as much as we used to be able to.
30/6/20 17:05 - Lorena: Jajaja tenemos que repasar algo más de música para que aprendas lo que dicen las letras
30/6/20 17:05 - Lorena: Upps, hoy es el día largo! Bueno espero que se haga ameno, si hablame estaré por casa seguramente!

30/6/20 21:19 - Lorena: Pero vale prometo enseñarte algo jaja

1/7/20 16:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

1/7/20 19:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/7/20 19:39 - Lorena: Vine a hacer un trámite de mi nacionalidad española
1/7/20 19:43 - Joe: Hahaha I figured. You said you don’t even really like the idea of marriage that much.
1/7/20 19:44 - Joe: But that’s good. I hope that goes well. I should’ve used all my extra time this morning to make breakfast or pack a lunch. I’m hella hungry
1/7/20 19:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/7/20 19:46 - Lorena: Jaja mierda, algunas cosas si que me prestas atención y te acordás jajaj

1/7/20 19:52 - Lorena: Ayyyy como me hace esperar  este hombre
1/7/20 19:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/7/20 19:53 - Lorena: Que hacesss?
1/7/20 20:35 - Joe: Sorry I was attending to injured children. They were dropping like flys for a minute there
1/7/20 20:36 - Joe: Getting through a whole day with no injuries is tough
1/7/20 20:39 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
1/7/20 20:40 - Lorena: Te dejo trabajar tranquilo, hablamos en otro momento. Suerte con la reunión del nuevo trabajo. 😘
1/7/20 20:47 - Joe: No worries, I’m almost out of here. I bring them to get lunch in a few minutes and then they go home
1/7/20 22:48 - Joe: I don’t know when this guy is going to call me 🤷‍♂️ still waiting
1/7/20 23:14 - Lorena: Te llamó ya?
1/7/20 23:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/7/20 23:17 - Joe: I guess I told him I’m free after 1pm and he never really confirmed the exact time he would contact me. So I guess I just have to wait around for his call
1/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: Jajaja oiiish
1/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: Ahh no habías confirmado!
1/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: Pero escribile, decile.. sobre qué hora crees que podemos reunirnos, para organizarme el día . Gracias o algo así no?
1/7/20 23:21 - Joe: Yesterday he was free after 3pm so I’m assuming he’ll call around that time. I’m not doing anything anyway so it’s fine
1/7/20 23:21 - Lorena: Sobre todo para saber si te agarra comiendo o después de econer
1/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: *Comer
1/7/20 23:23 - Joe: I just finished eating some ribs. I do kind of want another snack though 🤔
1/7/20 23:29 - Lorena: Jaja nosotras acá comimos varias cositas ricas también con un vino con limón que acá se toma mucho "tinto de verano"
1/7/20 23:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/7/20 23:33 - Joe: I’m just going to keep eating snacks until he calls. I think I might have some grapes or something
1/7/20 23:34 - Joe: Interesting choice haha is it good? I don’t think I’ve had a wine with lemon in it
2/7/20 0:01 - Lorena: Jaja sí está muy rico es típico de verano en España
2/7/20 0:01 - Lorena: 😋😋😋
2/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Todo diferente a tu cultura jaja
2/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Ya te llamó?

2/7/20 0:10 - Joe: Hahaha
2/7/20 0:11 - Joe: Noooo still no call. I’m going to end up taking a nap haha
2/7/20 0:12 - Lorena: Ohhh

2/7/20 0:15 - Lorena: Yo justo en mi habitación, ya con el ventilador jaja

2/7/20 0:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 0:18 - Joe: He just never confirmed when he would contact me. Terrible.
2/7/20 0:18 - Joe: Oh well
2/7/20 0:19 - Lorena: Dejale un mensaje, para que sepa que estás pendiente y que podés reunirte con el en otro momento
2/7/20 0:21 - Joe: True. Alright maybe I’ll send a text or something.
2/7/20 0:22 - Lorena: Sabes que te echo de menos, verdad?
2/7/20 0:22 - Lorena: Jaja

2/7/20 0:28 - Lorena: Jaja por momentos pienso que así podríamos volver a tener más tiempo
2/7/20 0:30 - Lorena: Pero preferiría que estés cerca jaja y poder pasar tiempo con vos, de verdad. Ya la distancia no me esta haciendo gracia porque tengo ganas de verte jajaj no contaba con esto
2/7/20 0:31 - Joe: Aaah so shitty. The US is having a cases go up and talking about slowing down opening up. I hate it.
2/7/20 0:32 - Joe: Saaaame. They can lock us down as long as they want if I can just get to you first.
2/7/20 0:32 - Joe: I just don’t want to be so far away anymore
2/7/20 0:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: No puedo creer que esto vaya a pasar otra vez ... Además tanto España como EEUU son de los países más afectados
2/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
2/7/20 0:38 - Lorena: Lo escribo otra vez que lo escribí mal
2/7/20 0:38 - Lorena: Prométeme que vas a venir Joe jaja.porfi. Te sigo esperando

2/7/20 0:39 - Joe: People keeps asking if I’m staying for good since I came back from Hawaii...I always tell them I want to go to Spain when I can
2/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: Jajaj oissh y cuáles son las opiniones?
2/7/20 0:42 - Joe: Everyone is pretty stoked for me
2/7/20 0:43 - Lorena: Jaja algo curioso que te haya dicho alguien?
2/7/20 0:43 - Lorena: Ellos saben que no nos conocemos en persona?
2/7/20 0:44 - Joe: Hahaha yeah the people that I tell why I’m going know
2/7/20 0:54 - Joe: I bet some people think it’s a little crazy and don’t want to say anything haha. But I really don’t see why not
2/7/20 0:56 - Lorena: Jajaja seguro
2/7/20 0:57 - Lorena: Yo misma lo pensaba, ahora ya me da igual. Quiero que pase jaja omg estoy trabajando la paciencia mucho 😅
2/7/20 0:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 1:01 - Joe: Honestly when you told me you didn’t have much patience early on, I was a little nervous that you wouldn’t wait. I’m really glad you’re holding out so long haha

2/7/20 12:50 - Joe: Don’t worry you didn’t wake me up. But I’m going to try and go back to sleep now haha. Have a good day! Talk to you soon
2/7/20 15:46 - Lorena: Libreee
2/7/20 15:48 - Lorena: Si no sé me siento ridícula diciéndole algo que me dice todo el mundo jajaj de hecho suelo "menos educada" cuando tengo que atenderlos que con la gente normal ..
2/7/20 15:49 - Lorena: Pero crucé unas miradas con ella y como estaba yo al teléfono no me acerqué solo la miraba jajaja
2/7/20 15:47 - Joe: Yaaaay
2/7/20 15:48 - Joe: I’m woke haha
2/7/20 15:49 - Joe: I’m supposed to start the second job today. I’m nervous 😬
2/7/20 15:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 15:50 - Lorena: Yihaa! Ayer tuviste la reunión? O es hoy?
2/7/20 15:52 - Joe: He called me back yesterday at around 4pm. But when we talked he didn’t set much up and ended up scheduling another call tomorrow but said we’d probably get started when he calls
2/7/20 15:53 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
2/7/20 15:53 - Lorena: A que hora quedas con el?
2/7/20 15:54 - Joe: Haha I want to see how you interact with people in general but I would especially like to see this “less polite” Lore 😂
2/7/20 15:54 - Joe: 1pm again haha
2/7/20 15:59 - Lorena: Jajaja dicen que soy buena interactuando con la gente, vendiendo y eso ...pero depende de mí día.. si son pijos o famosos suelo ser menos simpática jaja no sé.. los ayudo menos... ellos son siempre más privilegiados..Por ejemplo si viene un señor que no tiene ni idea que elegir o una chica que no tiene mucho dinero, me involucro muchísimo más jaja . Seguramente mis jefes no están de acuerdo con esto
2/7/20 16:00 - Lorena: Biennn!! seguro que sale genial. Tenés que ir al skatepark hoy no?
2/7/20 16:05 - Joe: Hahaha the bosses probably hate that 😂 I like it though.

2/7/20 16:19 - Joe: Only the best for you haha
2/7/20 16:41 - Lorena: 💪💪💪

2/7/20 16:44 - Joe: Haha true. I was going to move but I think since I’m only here till August i might as well save 2 months of rent. Plus my dad is redoing the house to sell it soon so I can help him out
2/7/20 16:46 - Joe: That’s good. I was hella trying to remember the one you like to drink. Alhambra especial 1933 or something like that hahah I don’t remember exactly.
2/7/20 16:46 - Lorena: Jaja yo también haría lo mismo que vos
2/7/20 16:47 - Lorena: De hecho antes de irme a costa rica me fui unos meses a casa de mis padres
2/7/20 16:47 - Lorena: Ah si, la va a vender?
2/7/20 16:47 - Lorena: Se mudan a otra casa?
2/7/20 16:48 - Joe: They’re going to move to Hawaii most likely. Join the rest of the family that’s out there haha.

2/7/20 16:51 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/7/20 16:52 - Lorena: Boom boom va a estar encantado con el tamaño de las paltas de Hawaii
2/7/20 16:55 - Joe: Haha true. He was excited about his little avocados on his tree so he’d love those big Hawaiian avocados.
2/7/20 16:57 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/7/20 16:57 - Lorena: Creo que su nieto será así en un futuro también cuando sea viejo
2/7/20 16:57 - Lorena: Nunca taardee
2/7/20 17:01 - Joe: Hahaha
2/7/20 17:02 - Joe: It’s time for me to go to work now 😔
2/7/20 17:03 - Joe: I’ll talk to you when I get a chance. Enjoy your evening.
2/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 17:06 - Lorena: Graciassss, tengo mucha hambre de camino a casa ya!!! Luego a lo de mis padres
2/7/20 17:06 - Lorena: Muuuuak 😘
2/7/20 17:55 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 17:55 - Joe: These things hurt my eyes hahaha
2/7/20 18:00 - Lorena: Jajajaja
2/7/20 18:00 - Lorena: Eso tiene pinta de apretar jaaja 🙈
2/7/20 18:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 18:03 - Lorena: Jaja me encanta poner los pies en agua 👵
2/7/20 18:14 - Joe: Hahahah that looks way more comfortable
2/7/20 18:14 - Joe: I’m done checking in kids so I get to take off the goggles now
2/7/20 18:14 - Joe: But I have to do stretches now and start skating I guess
2/7/20 18:15 - Lorena: Les enseñas un truco y ellos lo repiten? Jjj
2/7/20 19:04 - Joe: Only if they ask. They’re doing their own thing mostly now. Learning from each other and I just give tips now and then
2/7/20 21:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 21:33 - Lorena: Jajaja
2/7/20 21:34 - Lorena: Como fue con esos enanitos?
2/7/20 21:36 - Joe: It was pretty good today. No camp tomorrow so I just have to work on the coding stuff once the guy calls me
2/7/20 21:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 21:38 - Lorena: Perfecto!
2/7/20 21:42 - Joe: Sky is pretty. Have fun. Where you going?
2/7/20 21:43 - Lorena: A la sierra
2/7/20 21:43 - Lorena: A casa de mis padres hoy y mañana con mis amigas de ahí, vamos a la montaña
2/7/20 21:44 - Lorena: No trabajo el viernes así que aprovecho para salir de la ciudad
2/7/20 21:45 - Lorena: Y ya me dieron vacaciones! Estamos viendo con mis amigas para ir a la playa 💃
2/7/20 21:48 - Joe: Sweeeeet
2/7/20 21:49 - Joe: That’s awesome. I almost had a 3 day weekend but I feel I’m going to spend most of it learning the technology for the job haha.
2/7/20 21:52 - Lorena: Jaja y que estuviste haciendo por las tardes últimamente? El skatepark era solo por la mañana, excepto los días mortíferos de 12 jaja
2/7/20 22:07 - Joe: Either go skate and film, try to learn some coding stuff or some more spanish, or go to my friends house. Depends on the day but usually i get lunch after i get off then decide what to do.
2/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Jaja es que como en ese horario yo estoy súper dormida no sabia bien que hacías jaja
2/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Ya me enseñarás algo de eso que grabaste
2/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Español seguís practicando con Nelly o cómo lo haces? Jaja
2/7/20 22:15 - Lorena: Estoy nerviosa por ver a mis perras jaja
2/7/20 22:17 - Joe: Oh yeah i guess that's true.
2/7/20 22:18 - Joe: I have nothing to teach you haha i learn in a weird way. I just listen to stuff i don't know and keep looking up words until it sticks. I never feel like i learned something at the end of the day. I only notice it's working when i don't have to use the translator as much or i understand something i didn't before
2/7/20 22:19 - Joe: I'm really trying to practice hearing all the words that people say but it's hard to know when some words end and others start when i don't know the word they're saying in the first place haha
2/7/20 22:19 - Joe: They're going to be soo happy to see you
2/7/20 23:18 - Lorena: Ay Joe pero sabes que podés aprender conmigo!
2/7/20 23:18 - Joe: I learn every time i talk to you a little more
2/7/20 23:18 - Lorena: Todo lo que necesites, podemos practicar para que aprendas..! Pregúntale lo que quieras
2/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: *Pregúntame
2/7/20 23:20 - Joe: Haha i mean, there isn't anything in particular i think i need to learn. Not that i can think of anyway. But i have been picking up a lot from talking to you.
2/7/20 23:20 - Joe: I don't have to use the translator as often haha and sometimes i use it just to double check or because i don't know only a few of the words. I'm getting better
2/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Y más vas a aprender cuando estés delante jajaja
2/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Blablabla
2/7/20 23:21 - Joe: hahah i can't wait
2/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 23:22 - Joe: it'll be pretty funny haha damn hopefully i can communicate enough to keep you entertained
2/7/20 23:22 - Joe: Hahaha
2/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: Yo
2/7/20 23:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 23:25 - Joe: Hahaha dammit
2/7/20 23:25 - Lorena: Jajaja seguro que si
2/7/20 23:25 - Joe: Yeah but what about when i talk to you? That'll be good too haha
2/7/20 23:25 - Lorena: Aunque yo también seré Trump seguramente
2/7/20 23:25 - Joe: blahblahblah
2/7/20 23:25 - Lorena: Y vos esa niña jajaj
2/7/20 23:25 - Lorena: Jajaja sisii
2/7/20 23:26 - Joe: ahha for sure
2/7/20 23:26 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/7/20 23:27 - Joe: How? Freak out?
2/7/20 23:27 - Joe: hahaha
2/7/20 23:28 - Joe: I'm going to be the best mime in the world
2/7/20 23:29 - Lorena: Jjajjaaja
2/7/20 23:31 - Lorena: Yo te robaré un beso o te molestaré cuando no entienda
2/7/20 23:32 - Joe: Hahaha i like it. Totally fine with me 😂
2/7/20 23:37 - Lorena: Jajaj no, seré buena
2/7/20 23:38 - Lorena: 😇😇😇
2/7/20 23:42 - Joe: I'm really excited. Things are falling into place, except the possibility of another quarantine. But i have the passport coming and now i got my remote job.
2/7/20 23:42 - Joe: I wish i could just go today hahah mother fuckers
2/7/20 23:43 - Joe: I'm trying to read all these different things about the project i'm supposed to do for the guy haha
2/7/20 23:43 - Joe: https://gaugr.com/gaugrtools
2/7/20 23:44 - Joe: this is the tool or whatever that i'm going to work on
2/7/20 23:58 - Lorena: Jajaja lo importante es que vamos superando todas estas putas diferencias horarias a pesar de que estamos trabajando.. pero por favor, una segunda cuarentena no,  pq eso significaría que cerrarían nuestras fronteras jaja
2/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajaja 😏 te como
3/7/20 0:00 - Joe: We’ve been talking a lot still I think. Just not as much as the beginning of quarantine haha. I was talking to you all day every day
3/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Si estos días estuve mirando todas nuestras fotos que nos fuimos pasando jaja y videos
3/7/20 0:09 - Lorena: Y la verdad es que teníamos tanto tiempo!!! Ahora que ya forjamos la base.. nuestra conversación ya no es tanto saber que nos gusta, ya nos conocemos algo
3/7/20 0:11 - Lorena: Ahora nuestra conversacion general es desearnos los buenos días o las buenas noches, y lo que nos echamos de menos y queremos vernos jajaja 🤷
3/7/20 0:11 - Joe: haha for sure! I have a really big album full of the videos and pictures you send me
3/7/20 0:12 - Joe: That's very true. I guess i've already asked a lot of the main things i wanted to know about you. We kind of skipped the small talk but now we can't escape it hahah
3/7/20 0:13 - Joe: I'll have to think of some deep dark secret or something to tell you. Spice it up haha. Or i need to come up with some good questions.
3/7/20 0:15 - Lorena: Jaja tranquilo no me importa, no tengo que hablar de cosas fabulosas simplemente compartir algo con vos esta bien
3/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Las cosas que ví de vos son las que me gustan, tu forma de pensar o ver la vida, tu personalidad. Creo que podría pasar un buen rato cuando te vea
3/7/20 0:21 - Joe: Yeah i like the same things about you. My mom was asking me what i like about you and that was basically the list i gave her. The way you look at life and your personality. I like to hear you laugh and i'm always smiling when i listen to the audio clips you send or watch the videos. Standing there like an idiot smiling with my phone in my hand hahah 😂😂
3/7/20 0:22 - Joe: Don't even understand half of what i'm hearing too haha
3/7/20 0:23 - Joe: But you seem "lighthearted" to me. And the fact that you would even entertain the idea of me visiting you and how you pursued me, i find it all very interesting haha
3/7/20 0:42 - Lorena: Jajaja yo también. Mis amigas cada vez que me ven con una sonrisa tonta y que dejo de hablar me dicen, es Joe?
3/7/20 0:45 - Lorena: Jaja yo hay veces que los vuelvo a ver cómo ayer y entiendo alguna cosa más.. jaja aunque hay veces que es como vgjjvfffnj
3/7/20 0:48 - Joe: Hahah i try to speak slowly and clearly as i can. Sometimes i forget. And the mask makes it extra difficult to understand me i'm sure
3/7/20 0:48 - Lorena: Jajaja sin duda me pareció interesante lo "tímido/introvertido" que eras
3/7/20 0:49 - Joe: It's funny, when you talk fast, the first time i listen i don't hear anything haha but after i pick up the words i can't stop hearing it when i listen again. Practicing listening to you really helps
3/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: Inocente muchas veces jajaja
3/7/20 0:50 - Joe: Haha you were definitely good at making me nervous at the beginning. Always making me do stuff a little outside of my normal
3/7/20 0:50 - Joe: It was good though. It made it fun. Like when you started asking me to send you audio in spanish 😂 oh god
3/7/20 0:51 - Joe: I would try so hard to not sound absolutely ridiculous haha
3/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: Jajajaja
3/7/20 0:51 - Joe: ronronear
3/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: La verdad es que te "lo curraste"
3/7/20 0:52 - Lorena: Es como que hacías cosas para divertirme o te pedía cosas "locas" y las hacías
3/7/20 0:53 - Joe: Haha yeah like going in the water so early in the morning
3/7/20 0:53 - Joe: oooh that was so cold haha
3/7/20 0:53 - Lorena: Y todos los suyos bonitos de Hawaii mientras yo estaba encerrada jaja
3/7/20 0:53 - Joe: It was nice though
3/7/20 0:54 - Lorena: Sii ese vídeo!! Jaja y el que estabas bailando los delincuentes 🙊
3/7/20 0:54 - Joe: I bet that helped a lot. I was your window into the outside world.
3/7/20 0:54 - Joe: Aaaaah hahaha i forgot about that one hahahaha
3/7/20 0:54 - Joe: shit
3/7/20 0:55 - Lorena: Todos los vídeos son geniales, pero mucho se esconden entre tantos gif jajaj
3/7/20 0:55 - Joe: Well...i told you i'd send you a video of those things, so i did
3/7/20 0:56 - Lorena: El video de las gorras lo vi hoy jaja te quedaba tan bien la primera, deberías ponertela más
3/7/20 0:56 - Joe: I don't know why but when i watch a video you send from WhatsApp it downloads it to my phone. So i made an album with all the stuff you send me. Easy to find...i'll save them for when i need to embarrass you haha
3/7/20 0:57 - Joe: Just kidding i wouldn't do that, don't stop sending videos😂
3/7/20 0:58 - Joe: What? Which one?
3/7/20 0:59 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 0:59 - Lorena: Yo hay algunos que tengo guardados
3/7/20 0:59 - Lorena: Guardaré el resto!
3/7/20 1:00 - Lorena: Tenía guardado también el del short azul jajajaja y un día hicimos una foto con mi móvil y mis amigas justo estaban con mi teléfono y yo 🙄😱 jaja pero lo agarré rápidamente
3/7/20 1:01 - Joe: Hahahahaha shiiiiit
3/7/20 1:01 - Joe: I knew i shouldn't have sent those 😂
3/7/20 1:01 - Lorena: Una negra, spitwire puede ser? La carita con la llama
3/7/20 1:02 - Joe: Seriously that's the first time i've every taken a picture and sent it to someone like that haha
3/7/20 1:02 - Lorena: Me costó que lo hagas!! Jaja la primera vez que lo intenté me ignoraste jaja
3/7/20 1:03 - Joe: Oh yeah, spitfire haha
3/7/20 1:03 - Lorena: 😏😏😏
3/7/20 1:03 - Joe: Wait did I? I don't remember hahaha
3/7/20 1:03 - Lorena: Y cuando me despierto algún día veo el de los pantalones negros
3/7/20 1:04 - Lorena: 🤫🤫🤫
3/7/20 1:04 - Joe: Haha i don't know how you convinced me to do so much from so far away
3/7/20 1:04 - Joe: 🙉🙈🙈 Aaaaah hahah delete them 😂
3/7/20 1:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:07 - Lorena: Mierda no encontré el gif ese del niño que le tiraban la pelota con el que bromeabanos
3/7/20 1:07 - Lorena: Cuando no te das cuenta de las cosas jaja
3/7/20 1:07 - Joe: Oh i know the one
3/7/20 1:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:07 - Joe: My favorite hahah
3/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: eseeee jajaj
3/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: Recuerdo que lo intenté una vez
3/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: Aunque nunca a un desconocido se lo había "planteado"
3/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: Y al final terminé preguntándote si eras asexual jajajaja
3/7/20 1:09 - Joe: Hahahaha that was so strange to me when you asked that. I was thinking to myself, "what kind of vibes am i giving off here!?"
3/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: 👆
3/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 1:12 - Lorena: A mí me gusta cuando lo hacemos
3/7/20 1:13 - Joe: Saaame
3/7/20 1:14 - Joe: Damn i like how i've done things with you that i haven't done with anyone else haha. All cause of the distance. But it's such a different way of getting to know someone. There is literally no option to skip the talking part of it all
3/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: O te sentís un poco incómodo con eso del"sexo via WhatsApp"? Jaja
3/7/20 1:16 - Joe: No i don't feel uncomfortable with it. I enjoyed it haha
3/7/20 1:17 - Joe: I must really like you to be convinced to do it in the first place though haha. Shit, i didn't even have WhatsApp until you told me to download it so we could get off instagram
3/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: Jajaj si muy diferente, pero como muy natural y sincero..
3/7/20 1:18 - Joe: Exactly 😊
3/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: En primer lugar el que?
3/7/20 1:19 - Lorena: quiero que tengas la iniciativa algún día de volver a repetirlo jajaj cuando creas que podés estar super horny jajaja eso lo aprendí de vos
3/7/20 1:20 - Joe: Oh sorry haha to be convinced to have "WhatsApp sex" in the first place hahah
3/7/20 1:21 - Joe: Hahah i only got super horny because you sent me sexy videos. Mmmmm very sexy videos lasnjdob
3/7/20 1:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:22 - Joe: I'll try to take the initiative sometime haha sorry, i'm not great at that from a distance.
3/7/20 1:23 - Joe: Haha that dog loves to cuddle with you
3/7/20 1:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:26 - Joe: Hella sweet!
3/7/20 1:26 - Lorena: Jajaja inténtalo algún día y te enviaré otro
3/7/20 1:26 - Joe: Also, i don't know how the hell i didn't notice you have a nose ring until now hahah
3/7/20 1:27 - Joe: Mmm hahah you make this difficult for me 😂
3/7/20 1:27 - Lorena: 😯
3/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: 😒😒😒
3/7/20 1:28 - Joe: You need a better camera 😂😂
3/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: Te hice vídeos con luz por la mañana
3/7/20 1:28 - Joe: Just kidding haha i'm sorry i never noticed your nose ring 🙃
3/7/20 1:29 - Joe: I don't know why i never saw it...i'm blind. It's cute though 🤷‍♂️
3/7/20 1:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:29 - Joe: Hahahaha don't beat me up
3/7/20 1:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:31 - Joe: Haha rocked that kangaroo
3/7/20 1:31 - Joe: The kangaroo looks like it wants to beat that dudes ass haha good gif
3/7/20 1:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:35 - Joe: I'm totally not jealous of your dog right now ahha
3/7/20 1:35 - Joe: And did you flip me off?? hahaha
3/7/20 1:36 - Lorena: Jajaj me está ahogando y encima estaba teniendo una pesadilla
3/7/20 1:38 - Joe: Haha yeah you look trapped
3/7/20 1:38 - Joe: But it's so cute haha the dog with it's arm on you. Lot's of love
3/7/20 1:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:45 - Lorena: Jajaj es tan linda, jaja no necesito dormir con nadie así jajaj
3/7/20 1:45 - Joe: I want some animals to cuddle with me haha. Dookie still isn’t feeling well so he isn’t having any of my shit when I try to get him to sit near me
3/7/20 1:46 - Lorena: Dookie cual es? El de los pedos?
3/7/20 1:46 - Joe: Hah there won’t be any room for me when the dogs are around
3/7/20 1:46 - Lorena: Socks si está con vos cómo Kenya conmigo jaja tan cariñosos
3/7/20 1:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:48 - Joe: Those are his favorite treats and he is usually a little fatty so he must not be feeling well since he isn’t really eating
3/7/20 1:48 - Lorena: Jajaj para vos siempre hay lugar jajaj
3/7/20 1:48 - Lorena: Ahhh el gato jajaj
3/7/20 1:49 - Lorena: Ohhh es verdad
3/7/20 1:49 - Joe: True. I love socks.
3/7/20 1:49 - Lorena: No te pregunté cómo le había ido en el veterinario
3/7/20 1:49 - Lorena: Soy lo peor! 😖
3/7/20 1:50 - Joe: Oh yeah, they didn’t really find much. They ended up saying he has acid reflex or something like that. But then he had another appointment and might have some kind of infection
3/7/20 1:50 - Lorena: 🤔
3/7/20 1:50 - Joe: Naaaaah, the best
3/7/20 1:51 - Lorena: Ácid Reflex? Que viene a ser eso?
3/7/20 1:51 - Joe: Yeah I don’t know what’s wrong with him but he has an attitude and doesn’t like to be touched right now but usually he doesn’t mind
3/7/20 1:52 - Lorena: Ohhhhh
3/7/20 1:53 - Lorena: Pobreee Doockie!!!
3/7/20 1:53 - Joe: Yeah poor little dude. He is super grumpy haha
3/7/20 1:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 1:54 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 1:55 - Lorena: El pelo de elvis podría llegarme hasta acá jaja
3/7/20 1:55 - Lorena: Tiene pinta de soltar mucho pelo
3/7/20 1:56 - Lorena: Pero es cariñoso jjj
3/7/20 1:57 - Lorena: Okey ví a Dookie, Vi a Elvis, me falta otro principal jjj
3/7/20 1:59 - Joe: That’s all of the pets here. Socks and Biggie are my friends dogs.
3/7/20 1:59 - Joe: Oh yeah Elvis has super long hair and leaves it everywhere. He’s a cool cat though. Let’s you pick him up and carry him like a baby hahah
3/7/20 2:00 - Lorena: Vos faltas, vos jaja en video
3/7/20 2:00 - Joe: Hahahhh whoops 😂
3/7/20 2:00 - Lorena: Jajaja Joe papi
3/7/20 2:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 2:07 - Joe: Here is a video of my ugly face 😚
3/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Jaja por suerte esto puedo entenderlo jaja
3/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Mentira 🤫
3/7/20 2:30 - Joe: I honestly don’t have a good grasp on how much English you know haha I know that you know some for sure. I guess it’s hard to describe how much you know and don’t know.
3/7/20 2:31 - Joe: I wonder if you know more english than I know spanish 🤔
3/7/20 2:33 - Lorena: Mmm jajaj
3/7/20 2:33 - Lorena: No lo sé tampoco, depende lo atenta que este
3/7/20 2:40 - Joe: Well if I’m coming to Spain I’ll probably have more spanish than you have english eventually. But then if you want to come to the US to see me you’ll need to learn more engliiish
3/7/20 2:40 - Joe: So you can go to Hawaii hahaha
3/7/20 2:40 - Joe: I’m looking forward to visiting you in Spain but it would be the dream to be on an island with you somewhere in the world haha. One day
3/7/20 2:43 - Lorena: Jajaj yo aprenderé inglés menor también para que no sientas tanta presión
3/7/20 2:44 - Lorena: Jajaja tendré que casarme para que Trump me deje entrar
3/7/20 2:44 - Joe: You’ll just have to have a “green card marriage” hahaha
3/7/20 2:45 - Joe: Just kidding just kidding
3/7/20 2:45 - Lorena: Aunque le pregunté a una amiga y creo que tampoco es tan difícil pq vivo en España, tengo firmado un contrato de casa y trabajo
3/7/20 2:46 - Joe: I’m sure you’ll be able to come at least to visit someday. Fuck Trump haha
3/7/20 2:46 - Lorena: Jajaj buuu
3/7/20 2:46 - Joe: We’ll go on the tv show “90 day fiancé” 😂
3/7/20 2:47 - Lorena: Jaja eso sería genial!!! Volver a costa rica, tengo amigos ahí aún y ahí se habla mucho inglés y mucho español. Ambos por igual
3/7/20 2:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 2:49 - Lorena: Jajaj 🙈
3/7/20 2:49 - Joe: Hahahahaha
3/7/20 2:49 - Joe: I’m just kidding
3/7/20 2:49 - Lorena: Tu madre nos vería seguro jajaja
3/7/20 2:49 - Joe: That would be siiiick. Perfect place with the mix of spanish and english hahah
3/7/20 2:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 2:51 - Joe: For sure! She likes that show too much haha. It’s funny to watch it now that I’ve been talking to you for so long
3/7/20 2:51 - Joe: Sometimes I think what we’re doing is crazy...but then I see that show hahaha
3/7/20 2:51 - Lorena: Jajaja pero como es el programa?
3/7/20 2:52 - Lorena: Eso será actuado, como todos los programas de ese tipo, me cuesta creer que sean reales jajajaja
3/7/20 2:53 - Lorena: Eso es muy americano, acá se dice "americanadas" 🙊😂
3/7/20 2:53 - Joe: Ooooh it’s a crazy show haha. The person will go to another country to meet someone they have never met. Then they have to get married in 90 days or the person would have to go back to their country
3/7/20 2:53 - Lorena: Mierda jajaja
3/7/20 2:54 - Joe: Oh yeah definitely.
3/7/20 2:55 - Joe: But yeah, the show is wild. I’m sure much of it is staged but supposedly some of the people really get married
3/7/20 2:55 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 2:55 - Lorena: Voy a ver luego algo de eso
3/7/20 2:58 - Joe: Haha oh that’ll be good. I’m looking forward to hearing your reaction.
3/7/20 2:58 - Joe: Damn I wonder what TV is like in other places now. Hopefully I’ll be finding out soon enough but I never really thought about the differences in TV around the world
3/7/20 3:01 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 3:02 - Lorena: Tienen hijos y de todo
3/7/20 3:02 - Lorena: Hay gente que parece "normal" y gente que es raaaara 😷
3/7/20 3:02 - Joe: Are you watching already?
3/7/20 3:02 - Lorena: Una rubia con uñas super largas y un gordo
3/7/20 3:04 - Joe: Hahaha i haven’t seen a lot of the people but I didn’t like the ones that I saw very much
3/7/20 3:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:05 - Lorena: Jajaja estos pareja? No me lo creo Mohamed esta mucho mejor que ella
3/7/20 3:06 - Joe: Hahah you’re just going to judge all the people 😂 I wonder why they decide to go on the show. They must pay for a bunch of stuff or something. I don’t get it
3/7/20 3:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:07 - Lorena: Si lo siento, jajaja puedo hacer esta locura de verdad pero no salir en la TV
3/7/20 3:09 - Lorena: Así que seguramente me burle de ello .. muchas veces lo hago pero al final termino mirando algo.. me pasó con Sandra que me burlé de un programa suyo, y como me quedaba a dormir en su casa antigua, tuve que ver obligada la final del programa jajaja y a las 3hs me sabía todos los nombres e historias
3/7/20 3:09 - Joe: You judging the people is entertaining to me 🤷‍♂️ I think it’s funny the things you notice or point out to me. But yeah, real life is ok, on tv though 😬
3/7/20 3:10 - Joe: Hahah yeah that can happen. Even with phrases, you can start off saying something as a joke and eventually you’re really using the phrase haha
3/7/20 3:11 - Lorena: jaja qué juzgo las cosas que te entretienen? 😬😬 Ups
3/7/20 3:11 - Joe: I’m going to watch La Casa De Papel over and over until I understand everyone 😂
3/7/20 3:12 - Joe: Haha like when you were judging those ladies with the annoying voices. I don’t know how to describe it but you seem like such a nice person that when I hear you talk like that it makes me laugh
3/7/20 3:13 - Lorena: Yo me burlo mucho de todo.. jaja esa soy yo .. de gente bien no, solo de gente que me parece tonta cómo actúa o habla
3/7/20 3:14 - Joe: Perfect haha
3/7/20 3:14 - Lorena: Jajaja amable? Jajaj soy una hija de puta
3/7/20 3:14 - Lorena: No mentira,es broma jajaja soy buena persona
3/7/20 3:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:14 - Joe: Hahahah
3/7/20 3:15 - Joe: Mischievous
3/7/20 3:15 - Lorena: Por suerte a Sandra le tocó ir al evento también
3/7/20 3:16 - Lorena: Y pudo comprobar todo lo que yo decía de esas chicas y de un chico que se gay muy malo jajaja
3/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: Hay una a la que no soportamos, le pusimos el apodo" la enana" jaja ella es muy bajita y tiene voz de pito.. además de que cuando solo dice tonterías jajaja
3/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: Sandra la grabó, para que Luchi pueda verla jajaj
3/7/20 3:18 - Joe: Hahaha 😂
3/7/20 3:19 - Joe: She had to share with a video haha
3/7/20 3:20 - Lorena: Si, por su forma de vestir también jajaj jaja iba vestida con tantos modelos horribles cada día
3/7/20 3:23 - Joe: Hahaha yes her outfit is not very flattering on her
3/7/20 3:26 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 3:26 - Lorena: Ahora me siento juzgada por vos
3/7/20 3:27 - Lorena: Vos tan correcto, sin criticar. Yo burlándome de los prometidos o de la enana 🤐
3/7/20 3:28 - Joe: Hahah if I ever judge you, the only conclusion I come to at the end is that you’re beautiful
3/7/20 3:29 - Joe: I enjoy it. Say whatever about whoever haha
3/7/20 3:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:31 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 3:33 - Lorena: Me gusta que seas corny, jajaja cualquiera podría burlarse de mi ahora
3/7/20 3:34 - Joe: I try to keep the “corniness” to a minimum haha
3/7/20 3:35 - Joe: But then you know when you hear me being corny that I really like you and I’m willing to sound dumb for you haha
3/7/20 3:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:35 - Joe: Hahaha damn this gif makes me think about how little I talked at first every time you send it 😂
3/7/20 3:36 - Lorena: Jaja lo sé!!! Fue un trabajo a distancia ... Nunca decías nada cursi, ni piropo, nada jaja políticamente correcto
3/7/20 3:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:39 - Lorena: 2 abr jaja
3/7/20 3:40 - Joe: Hahah it’s rare for me to compliment too 😂 I guess you’ve noticed. Well in case I don’t say anything like that for a while, I’ll say it now, I think you’re beautiful and funny and smart. I love your attitude towards life and the fun we have just spending hours talking through WhatsApp haha. I think you’re the best
3/7/20 3:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:42 - Lorena: Jajaja
3/7/20 3:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:42 - Joe: Hahahahah shiiiiit
3/7/20 3:43 - Joe: 😂 😂
3/7/20 3:43 - Joe: Whyyyyy hahaha
3/7/20 3:45 - Lorena: Gracias bombón! Pienso lo mismo!! Me gustas mucho y haberte conocido es genial, principalmente pq no me suelen gustar tanto los chicos para llegar al punto de estar atenta, cariñosa, etc.. que es al punto que llegué con vos a miles de km jaja
3/7/20 3:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:47 - Joe: Vos haha
3/7/20 3:48 - Joe: But I also don’t get to this point with many girls. You did excellent work at the remote job of getting my attention hahah
3/7/20 3:49 - Joe: I seriously have no interest in girls at the moment besides you. Shit, before you messaged me I was very content being alone 🤷‍♂️ but something about you won me over
3/7/20 3:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:50 - Lorena: Jajajajajajajaja
3/7/20 3:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:52 - Lorena: Boludo por favor tenés que prohibir los gif de mister Bean jaja sigo encontrando nuevos
3/7/20 3:53 - Joe: Hahah Mr Bean never fails!
3/7/20 3:54 - Lorena: Me alegro que sea así, que no estés interesado en otras chicas y que te interese yo jajaja. Si te sirve para sumar a este nivel tan cursi jajaja el otro día me escribió otro de los chicos que me veía con el antes de la cuarentena y le tuve que decir que no jaja, la misma conversación que con el otro
3/7/20 3:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 3:56 - Joe: Damn another one gets let down my Lore for me hahaa I feel special 😂
3/7/20 3:56 - Lorena: Me sentía incómoda al explicarle a ellos lo que me había pasado durante la cuarentena jaja, pero bueno, así mejor ...
3/7/20 3:57 - Lorena: Jajaja 🤷
3/7/20 3:57 - Joe: Yeah I’m sure that’s a strange conversation haha glad you handle it well
3/7/20 3:57 - Lorena: Yo no quería explicarlo.. pero cuando me dijo de vernos y yo siempre decía no puedo jaja, ya tuve que decir la verdad
3/7/20 3:58 - Lorena: El primero se enfadó mucho, de hecho intento burlarse de vos, sin conocerte, pero no funcionó jajaja
3/7/20 3:58 - Lorena: Luego el otro, dijo que se alegraba por mi, pero siento que es un poco mentira jaja
3/7/20 3:59 - Lorena: Mierda te cuento al final todo jajaja
3/7/20 3:59 - Joe: 😬
3/7/20 3:59 - Joe: Hahah
3/7/20 4:00 - Joe: Don’t worry you can tell me anything.
3/7/20 4:00 - Joe: I’m glad I haven’t had to have that conversation with anyone yet 🤣
3/7/20 4:01 - Lorena: Yet... 😬
3/7/20 4:02 - Joe: Hahaha well I doubt that I would ever have that conversation
3/7/20 4:02 - Joe: But I would tell you if I did.
3/7/20 4:02 - Joe: I would tell you anything that you should know. I trust you and I hope you trust me too at this point to be honest with you.
3/7/20 4:03 - Lorena: Jaja okey
3/7/20 4:05 - Lorena: Si igual no te pido nada, no hace falta que vos tengas esas conversaciones.. yo si quería tenerlas, porque no quería ser hipócrita con ellos, ni forzarme a estar con quién no quiero. Simple
3/7/20 4:08 - Joe: Haha yeah pretty simple I guess
3/7/20 4:09 - Lorena: 🤷🤷🤷 que seco
3/7/20 4:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 4:09 - Lorena: Si lo sé no te digo nada 🙃
3/7/20 4:10 - Joe: Hahaha I don’t know what to say 😂 but I think you’re great for telling them the truth and even for talking to me about it too. It’s just a little honesty that I can appreciate
3/7/20 4:12 - Lorena: Jaja bueno, igual todo biennn
3/7/20 4:13 - Lorena: Eso sí, si cancelas el viaje en algún momento avísame jajaja
3/7/20 4:14 - Joe: Hahahah
3/7/20 4:14 - Joe: Alright I’ll let you know. But it’s not happening.
3/7/20 4:14 - Lorena: Me voy a dormir, que Kenya me mira con los ojos de dormida jaja
3/7/20 4:14 - Joe: If you get tired of waiting, let me know haha
3/7/20 4:15 - Lorena: Jaja okey!!
3/7/20 4:15 - Joe: Ok sleep well! I’ll talk to you later. Buenas noches babe 😘
3/7/20 4:15 - Lorena: No creo!
3/7/20 4:15 - Lorena: Escucha
3/7/20 4:15 - Lorena: Tu reunión?
3/7/20 4:17 - Joe: My meeting.m? With the guy? He never called!! He texted me at 2:15 asking if I was ready to get started, I texted back saying I was ready...and nothing
3/7/20 4:18 - Joe: Haha but me and you? We’re meeting babe. For sure. It’s happening. Anyway, get some sleep. Buenas nochesss
3/7/20 4:22 - Lorena: Mmmm este chico no se está portando bien..
3/7/20 4:23 - Lorena: No entiendo.. el te contacta y luego no responde.. me parece poco serio.. espero que puedas hablar mejor con el y que sólo este ocupado
3/7/20 4:23 - Joe: Yeah he is being weird but the product looks legit. I sent you a link. They have an iOS and Android app too.
3/7/20 4:24 - Joe: We’ll see what happens. I don’t understand either haha
3/7/20 4:24 - Lorena: Mmmm
3/7/20 4:24 - Joe: I’ll contact him tomorrow since I’m off all day.
3/7/20 4:24 - Joe: But you get some sleep we’ll talk later
3/7/20 4:24 - Lorena: Pero aún no te respondió
3/7/20 4:25 - Lorena: A ese mensaje
3/7/20 4:25 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️ I’ll call him
3/7/20 4:25 - Lorena: Si, mejor llama, no le escribas más mensajes por qué se olvida al parecer
3/7/20 4:26 - Joe: It’s always text or email that he has been unreliable. He can’t avoid me on the phone. But we just talked on the phone yesterday and it seemed like we were going to start today. Whatever.
3/7/20 4:27 - Lorena: Si llama y deja las cosas claras con el
3/7/20 4:27 - Joe: I’ll figure it out
3/7/20 4:27 - Joe: Last chance for him haha
3/7/20 4:27 - Lorena: Si está ocupado que lo diga, pero tu tiempo es importante
3/7/20 4:27 - Joe: It did give me more time to study up on what I need to know so that’s good but yeah, tomorrow is his last chance haha
3/7/20 4:28 - Lorena: Bien, ánimo! Seguro pueden hablar bien y si no, no pasa nada!
3/7/20 4:28 - Lorena: Ya me contarás qué pasa
3/7/20 4:29 - Lorena: Kenya y yo te deseamos buenas noches! Muuak 😘
3/7/20 4:29 - Lorena: Buena tarde jaja
3/7/20 4:29 - Joe: You are riiight babe. I’ll keep you informed on the situation. Buenas noches 😘
3/7/20 7:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 7:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 8:25 - Lorena: Dios acabo de tener una pesadilla horrible que ya la soñé antes ... Me va el corazón a mil
3/7/20 8:26 - Lorena: Ohhhh 😍😍
3/7/20 8:27 - Lorena: Jajajajaj muy bueno .. el segundo no lo veía y socks como una momia a tu lado 😂
3/7/20 8:32 - Joe: Aw I’m sorry babe. You’ll have to tell me about this nightmare sometime.
3/7/20 8:33 - Joe: Socks being a little weirdo haha
3/7/20 8:39 - Lorena: Es del: te lo advierto. La pesadilla es que estaba viviendo en una casa.. 6° planta. Las ventanas estaban abiertas completamente, lola venía corriendo hacia mí y salía volando por la ventana, Kenya se frenaba y Lola caía al vacío.. Uf que horror, como lloraba en el sueño
3/7/20 8:39 - Lorena: "Es feo: te lo advierto"
3/7/20 8:41 - Lorena: La otra vez le tiraba una pelota y ella con la emoción no se daba cuenta de la ventana tampoco y la traspasaba
3/7/20 8:41 - Joe: Aww damn that sucks.
3/7/20 8:42 - Joe: Even worse if you throw the ball 😞 that’s a sad dream
3/7/20 8:43 - Lorena: Sueño eso por miedo y un trauma que tuve de pequeña, un coche atropelló a mí perra y él se fue a la fuga. Nunca más quise tener perros
3/7/20 8:44 - Joe: Oooh that’s so sad! I’m sorry!
3/7/20 8:46 - Joe: Damn I was not expecting such sadness from the nightmare.
3/7/20 8:46 - Lorena: Jaja
3/7/20 8:46 - Lorena: Perdón
3/7/20 8:47 - Lorena: Prefiero soñar con cucarachas o tarántulas que les tengo fobia antes que con esto
3/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Me levanté agitada como sin aire
3/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Pero vi el vídeo de los 4 perritos jjj 😊
3/7/20 8:50 - Joe: Haha well I hope the video made you feel a little better. And don’t worry I’m glad you shared with me I just didn’t expect it

3/7/20 9:29 - Lorena: Jajaj si a ella le encanta. Yo duermo con ella como si fuese un humano
3/7/20 9:30 - Lorena: Y esos dos mini perros, son también del chico que juega? Jaja
3/7/20 15:38 - Joe: Aaaah I passed out last night haha my bad
3/7/20 15:40 - Joe: Those dogs belong to my friends upstairs neighbor. Usually they don’t like to be around strangers I guess but they were chillin last night haha

3/7/20 22:34 - Joe: I like your laugh. It’s infectious haha but yeah sleeping out there would be sick. Go camping or something. I’m sure that’s not allowed though.
3/7/20 22:34 - Joe: But the place you went looked awesome
3/7/20 22:37 - Lorena: Jaja gracias lindo. No está permitido, pero si pernoctar, es decir, dormir sin tienda de campaña. Solo sobre de dormir. Si te pudiese trasladar ahora mismo te diría de hacerlo jaja
3/7/20 22:37 - Lorena: Siiii, me encanta. Más que cualquier calle o edificio de madrid. Es tan especial la naturaleza, la luz , como cambia con las estaciones! Siempre tan linda
3/7/20 22:39 - Joe: Haha sobre de dormir

3/7/20 22:48 - Lorena: Jajaja si, soy un poco inesperada e impulsiva 😬
3/7/20 22:49 - Lorena: Y encima cuando fumo o tomo unas cervezas más de la cuenta jaja siento las cosas "más fuerte"
3/7/20 22:49 - Lorena: Quiero todo ya jaja jaja
3/7/20 22:52 - Joe: Hahah uh oh impulsive Lore is here after a couple of beers and smoking 😂
3/7/20 22:53 - Joe: You’re hilarious. I need to see you in person hahaha ugh stop being far away
3/7/20 22:53 - Joe: Oh, and that dude told me Monday now 🙄
3/7/20 22:56 - Lorena: Jajaja si siempre un poco, creo que vos sos perfecto para mi balance jajajaj
3/7/20 22:57 - Lorena: Contame, lo llamaste? Que te dijo?
3/7/20 22:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/7/20 22:59 - Joe: Yeah he just said he got busy and that he would send me the non-disclosures and contract through email and we’ll start Monday 🤷‍♂️
3/7/20 22:59 - Joe: I’ll believe it when I get paid 😂
3/7/20 23:01 - Lorena: Jaja es un poco arriesgado por su comportamiento, no fue muy serio. Pero bueno, tenés que intentarlo. Esta bien pagado y puede darte experiencia..así que no perdés demasiado, en todo caso, ganas. Así que ánimo rulitos,con contrato mejor así queda todo por escrito!
3/7/20 23:05 - Joe: Yeah and I’ll make sure to read the contact good haha
3/7/20 23:06 - Joe: If anything I’ll learn the technology and add it to my resume. Its use is super common for building apps so it’s a valuable skill
3/7/20 23:10 - Lorena: Claro!!! Esa app es un buen proyecto seguramente. Además así ves como trabajan ellos. Ya trabajaste para alguna empresa en codificación o por tu cuenta siempre?
3/7/20 23:15 - Joe: Well I’ve worked for a company but it wasn’t as an employee. Similar to this project but not as big. Always contract work or consulting.
3/7/20 23:28 - Joe: I’m about to skate and film babe. But I’m glad you had a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😘
4/7/20 0:07 - Lorena: Yo creo que es buena opción, dar una oportunidad para ver...el lunes se pondrán las cosas en su lugar

4/7/20 13:00 - Joe: Aaaaaah babe I only got like 3 hours of sleep and now I have to get up 😩
4/7/20 13:01 - Joe: I’m sooooo sleepy!!!
4/7/20 13:01 - Joe: Hahah heeeey cutie
4/7/20 13:14 - Joe: Yeah Socks and Biggie are coming with us.
4/7/20 13:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 14:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 14:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 16:10 - Lorena: Salí de trabajar! Ahora a casa relaaxx
4/7/20 16:11 - Lorena: Cuánto dura el viaje?
4/7/20 16:12 - Lorena: Ahhh que lindaa socks con sus orejas ahí mirando por la ventana jjjj y vossss 🤤
4/7/20 16:13 - Lorena: Gracias por el video de viaje guía preferido!
4/7/20 16:17 - Joe: The trip is 4 hours. We’re about halfway there now.
4/7/20 16:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 16:20 - Joe: No problem. I’ll send more when I get somewhere cool haha
4/7/20 16:20 - Lorena: Jajaja
4/7/20 16:20 - Lorena: Te vas a acostumbrar a que te haga piropos
4/7/20 16:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 16:22 - Joe: Hahah I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it
4/7/20 16:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 16:26 - Lorena: Jaja cómo se llaman esas cataratas?
4/7/20 16:27 - Lorena: Que sitios conoces de estados unidos?
4/7/20 16:32 - Joe: Mossbrea falls
4/7/20 16:34 - Joe: Like specific places? So many places to name haha
4/7/20 16:37 - Joe: But the United States is so big I’ve barely seen much even though I have a decent list I guess. I’ve been to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and New York. Still have a lot I haven’t seen
4/7/20 16:40 - Lorena: Jaja sí por estados
4/7/20 16:40 - Lorena: Y cuál te gustó más? Quitando Hawaii jaja
4/7/20 16:42 - Joe: I liked Washington the most but I only went in summer. I heard it is cloudy and rainy most of the year
4/7/20 16:43 - Joe: So I don’t know if I’d like it all year around. Texas was too hot, dry, and flat but at least it is relatively cheap to live there
4/7/20 16:45 - Joe: New York had too many people. I forgot I also went to New Jersey and Pennsylvania too, same trip as New York. East coast is very densely packed compared to when you go out west.
4/7/20 16:45 - Joe: Arizona was hot and a hella racist haha
4/7/20 16:47 - Joe: Oregon is cool. My brother lives there. Great for outdoor stuff. They get snow in the winter, summer and spring are pretty nice. I have to drive a couple of hours to the mountains for snow here.
4/7/20 16:48 - Lorena: Buuuuu no queremos a Arizona
4/7/20 16:49 - Lorena: El resto suena genial
4/7/20 16:51 - Lorena: Aunque lo más lindo California no?
4/7/20 16:52 - Joe: Haha Texas is pretty racist too. The whole southern part of the states is kind of racist 😬
4/7/20 16:52 - Lorena: 😷😷😷
4/7/20 16:52 - Joe: Oh yeah California is really nice. Ideal weather and have access to all kinds of cool places
4/7/20 16:53 - Lorena: A la playa de San Onofre, fuiste?
4/7/20 16:56 - Joe: Haha no that’s like 8 hours away from me. I rarely go to Southern California
4/7/20 16:58 - Joe: Also, the water is cold at the beaches here. Not the most pleasant unless it’s super hot. Not like tropical waters at all haha
4/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Upsss
4/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Y La Jolla? Esta lejos de vos también?
4/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Ahí hay una construcción que me encanta
4/7/20 17:03 - Lorena: 😬😬😬
4/7/20 17:08 - Joe: Oh yeah that’s far too. A lot beaches you think of are probably around San Diego
4/7/20 17:10 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/BnR5uWrjDTN/?igshid=1upxonlc1ncdz
4/7/20 17:12 - Joe: That’s tight! Super far from me though haha. Almost at the California/Mexico border
4/7/20 17:17 - Lorena: Jaja oh todo lejos
4/7/20 17:17 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/BdnDKsmBnLh/?igshid=c406t3gpnslz
4/7/20 17:18 - Lorena: Esto está por ahí también creo, menos horas
4/7/20 17:20 - Joe: Haha a little closer but still Southern California
4/7/20 17:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 17:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 17:26 - Joe: My friend is driving so bad hahaha swerving
4/7/20 17:26 - Joe: I keep telling him to drive better hahah
4/7/20 17:28 - Lorena: Jajaja
4/7/20 17:29 - Lorena: Kyle es el del auto con marchas no? Jaja tendrías que conducirlo vos ahora un rato así prácticas jajaja
4/7/20 17:29 - Lorena: Que lleva socks? Un chaleco rosa? 😅
4/7/20 17:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 17:32 - Joe: We took his other car. Automatic gears ⚙️
4/7/20 17:34 - Joe: Haha it’s her leash. We stopped recently to let the dogs out for a bit
4/7/20 17:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 17:39 - Lorena: Ah jaja que raro debe ser conducir sin mover las marchas
4/7/20 17:40 - Lorena: Oiiish jjj
4/7/20 17:45 - Joe: It’s rare to drive with moving the gears here haha. Super. Having manual gears is the best security for a car here cause people don’t know how to drive them, so they can’t steal them
4/7/20 17:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 17:56 - Joe: I’m almost there! Finally haha
4/7/20 17:57 - Lorena: Uuuuh

4/7/20 19:40 - Joe: It took so long to walk here. Or at least it felt like a long walk
4/7/20 20:06 - Joe: Me and Kyle are the only ones that went in to swim hahaha
4/7/20 20:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 20:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/7/20 20:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

5/7/20 6:35 - Lorena: Hace poco también me mostraste que estaban tirando fuegos, lo hacen por algún motivo? Acá solo se puede en fechas señaladas como navidad, si tiras fuera de fecha, police va a tu casa jaja
5/7/20 6:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

5/7/20 17:21 - Joe: Oooh. There is no screen on your window?
5/7/20 17:22 - Joe: Yeah a net would be a good idea. But they’ll still get in your room so they might get you later haha
5/7/20 17:23 - Lorena: Jaja no, a Sandra esta mañana me dijo que a ella también la habían picado . Tenemos que poner

5/7/20 18:07 - Joe: Ohhh yeah I wonder when they’ll allow all that stuff again. Probably phase 3 but who knows when that comes
5/7/20 18:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

5/7/20 18:58 - Lorena: Será que la usas mucho últimamente jajajaja

5/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: Jaja vos estás arreglándolo también? Se te da bien la mecánica?
5/7/20 23:46 - Joe: I’m alright at fixing stuff but not great at diagnosing the problem. Once I know what it is and how to fix it I can usually do the work
6/7/20 0:24 - Lorena: Muy bien, así me gusta. Jaja
6/7/20 0:45 - Lorena: Bueno, me voy a dormirr que estoy cansadita ya! Que pases una buena tardee y nochee! Muak 😘
6/7/20 8:06 - Joe: Buenos días babe! I’m super tired. I never even got to drive the car today 😡 he was having all kinds of problems getting this thing done haha.
6/7/20 8:07 - Joe: But I’m going to bed now because I have to wake us early tomorrow. Enjoy your morning and afternoon! I’ll talk to you later 😘
6/7/20 9:41 - Lorena: Hola, esta noche no me pico ni un solo mosquito jaja! asi que dormí muy bien y con el ventilador toda la noche. Que ganas de estar en la playa. Que pena que no pudiste conducir, bueno algun día de esta semana!
6/7/20 9:47 - Lorena: Yo esta semana ya empiezo a trabajar de tarde, asi que igual cuando te despiertes, seguramente este en el trabajo! Que tengas buen día con los niños en el skatepark y la reunión con el chico de codificación! Muak 😘
6/7/20 15:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 15:45 - Joe: Haha I want to be on the beach too. I was just thinking about how much I miss going to the beach in the mornings!
6/7/20 15:46 - Joe: I signed the non-disclosure for that other job then never received the actual contract. The dude is starting to really annoy me haha
6/7/20 15:46 - Joe: Anyways, I hope you’re having a good day at work. Time for my morning coffee ☕️
6/7/20 15:48 - Lorena: Buenos días!
6/7/20 15:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 15:50 - Lorena: Mmm pero tenía que enviártelo, a que hora empezás hoy con el?
6/7/20 15:52 - Lorena: Recuérdale que está pendiente ese contrato y la hora de hoy. Así no hay malentendido 💪
6/7/20 15:53 - Lorena: Gracias, si me escribiste justo 10 min antes de que entre a trabajar ☺️
6/7/20 15:54 - Joe: We didn’t set anything up for today. Last time I talked to him he said he would send all the contacts and stuff 🤷‍♂️
6/7/20 15:54 - Joe: Good idea
6/7/20 15:55 - Lorena: Okey bombón si algo falla que no sea por vos, vos intenta hacer contacto para cerrar ese contrato y ganar ese dinero
6/7/20 15:55 - Joe: Haha good. I got a super short morning conversation with you just in time 😂
6/7/20 15:55 - Lorena: Si el ves que no responde, ya te olvidas. Pero por lo menos sabes que fue por su culpa no suya
6/7/20 15:56 - Joe: You’re very right. Thanks for the advice babe I appreciate it
6/7/20 15:57 - Lorena: Por su culpa, no tuya!!( Puto traductor)
6/7/20 15:57 - Joe: Hah I know what you meant
6/7/20 15:58 - Lorena: De nada!!! Jjj sii hablamos en mi noche si estás libre vale?? Suerte con los diablitos jaja Besitossss
6/7/20 16:00 - Joe: Ok babe sounds good. Have a great day! I’ll talk to you soon 😊 😘
6/7/20 21:09 - Lorena: Vino una señora a tienda hoy, que no quería pagar envíos ni esperar y le expliqué las mejores opciones pero ella  no razonaba lo que le decía, super tacaña y maleducada
6/7/20 21:10 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
6/7/20 21:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 21:11 - Lorena: She really pushed my bottons
6/7/20 21:50 - Joe: Aaaah damn that sucks. I hate people like that. Need it their way even if that isn’t an option haha. Idiots.
6/7/20 21:52 - Joe: *buttons 

That’s terrible. I’m sorry to hear that you had to deal with such a rude person today.
6/7/20 21:52 - Joe: Customers are the worst sometimes
6/7/20 23:15 - Lorena: Hola, ya estoyyyyy
6/7/20 23:18 - Lorena: Si jaja no era contra mi, pero su manera de interactuar era fatal jaja y mi paciencia se agotó. Sobre todo es cuando querés ayudar a alguien, pero esa persona no razona.. y no dice gracias, es como.. de verdad?
6/7/20 23:18 - Lorena: Pero bueno, ella era así .. seguramente nadie la aguanté a su alrededor jaja
6/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Igual por suerte es una mínima parte, antes atendí a otra que era super amable de hecho hablamos de la colonia que llevaba puesta, olía súper bien la señora jaja se sintió que me estaba haciendo un piropo cuando se lo pregunté ... Me contó que se había duchado y se pensaba que ya no olía jajaja
6/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: Se sintió que LE estaba haciendo un piropo ( otra vez el traductor) jaja escribo rápido y se escribe solo
6/7/20 23:24 - Joe: That's good. It sounds like for the most part the people are alright haha.
6/7/20 23:24 - Joe: I used to work at a few pharmacies, customers were always in a bad mood 😬
6/7/20 23:25 - Joe: That dude didn't answer my call. I think i'm over working with this guy 🤬
6/7/20 23:26 - Joe: I was really looking forward to working on a mobile app but i don't know what to do at this point. So frustrating. What a waste of time
6/7/20 23:27 - Lorena: Cuánto tiempo trabajaste en farmacias? Entonces estudiaste eso? Ibas con bata? Jaja gracioso.. jaja te sabes todos esos nombres raros entonces
6/7/20 23:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:28 - Joe: Haha yeah i had to memorize all the drug names. I worked in pharmacy for like 5 years, i had to do a little school but not much. I wasn't the pharmacist, i was a pharmacy technician, which is like the assistant. Not a fun job hahah
6/7/20 23:29 - Lorena: No entiendo por qué es tan poco serio, creo que ya no tenés que hacer más. Lo intentaste y el no valora tu tiempo... Eso puede significar que cuando trabajes con el no sea serio o no te pague o cosas raras
6/7/20 23:29 - Joe: hahhahaa
6/7/20 23:29 - Lorena: Si realmente esta interesado, te llamará.
6/7/20 23:29 - Joe: That's what i was worried about. Especially when he sent the NDA but not the contract for the work.
6/7/20 23:29 - Lorena: Wow 5 años! Jajaja
6/7/20 23:30 - Joe: I still haven't received a contract so yeah, i'm over it haha
6/7/20 23:30 - Lorena: Okey cuando me duela algo te preguntaré jajaja
6/7/20 23:30 - Joe: True
6/7/20 23:31 - Lorena: Yo creo que ya hiciste todo lo que podías hacer, estuviste pendiente de ello, etc y el últimamente no esta portándose bien
6/7/20 23:31 - Joe: Part of my job was to literally not answer questions like that, by law i had to get the pharmacist to recommend medication. I will tell you what i think would help if you ask me hahaha but at work i had to get a pharmacist even if i knew the answer
6/7/20 23:32 - Lorena: A lo mejor en unos días te envía el contrato, pero mientras tanto, hacé tus planes y tus cosas, tu tiempo es tuyo! Y si no te está pagando aún.. tenés que hacer cosas que te hagan bien.... no esperarlo durante horas a que el diga algo
6/7/20 23:33 - Lorena: Jajaja pero la sabes la respuesta. A mí me da igual que seas farmacéutico o no 😂
6/7/20 23:33 - Joe: Yeah i already wasted a bunch of time waiting for him.
6/7/20 23:33 - Lorena: Pero no te desanimes vale?
6/7/20 23:33 - Joe: Hahah yeah for you i will answer
6/7/20 23:34 - Joe: Never
6/7/20 23:34 - Lorena: El no es serio, ni profesional...
6/7/20 23:35 - Joe: Yeah i'm not too worried about it. I'm just going to keep working on what i can for now. My boss actually said he has a coding job he needs done for his other skate camp haha.
6/7/20 23:36 - Lorena: 💪
6/7/20 23:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:37 - Joe: hahaha
6/7/20 23:37 - Joe: 😂😂
6/7/20 23:38 - Joe: I tried not to get too excited about that job anyway.
6/7/20 23:38 - Joe: ugh
6/7/20 23:38 - Joe: whack
6/7/20 23:39 - Joe: I did want to get paid though haha
6/7/20 23:40 - Lorena: Bueno, entusiasmate cuando ellos contacten con vos y eso ya pasó pq les interesas.. luego si sale el trabajo genial. Son posibilidades.. si no sale bueno, ya llegarán otros
6/7/20 23:40 - Joe: Yeaaaaah. Whatever it's cool
6/7/20 23:40 - Lorena: Normal... Jaja yo también quiero estudiar codificación si pagan eso jajaj
6/7/20 23:40 - Joe: Life goes on haha
6/7/20 23:41 - Joe: They pay better than that
6/7/20 23:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:41 - Lorena: "boludo que se meta los 1500 dólares por el culo, así de fácil"
6/7/20 23:41 - Joe: That was mid-tier pay i would say. At least for the Bay Area but cost of living is crazy high here too so it makes sense
6/7/20 23:42 - Lorena: Claro... Jaja yo quiero ganar como en bahía y vivir como en España 😅
6/7/20 23:42 - Joe: They are paying for the time it took me to learn everything 😂😂
6/7/20 23:43 - Lorena: Obvio!
6/7/20 23:44 - Joe: Graphic designer, user interface designer, user experience designer all get very high pay too and can be remote
6/7/20 23:44 - Joe: You would be good at those jobs
6/7/20 23:45 - Joe: I really want to see how well you could design websites if you learned how to use the right tools and spent a tiny amount of time studying it. You already have a good eye which is hard to teach
6/7/20 23:46 - Lorena: Jajaj mmm
6/7/20 23:46 - Joe: My designs suuuuuck!
6/7/20 23:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: Nunca lo había pensado lo de las webs etc, pero me parece interesante, me di cuenta con vos cuando me contaste alguna cosa
6/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: O viendo lo de tu juego, probando con Photoshop jaja
6/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: Ohhhhh hace mucho que no jugamos jaja nostalgia
6/7/20 23:47 - Joe: Hahaha
6/7/20 23:48 - Joe: Damn you're right we haven't played in a while
6/7/20 23:48 - Lorena: Me gusta el diseño gráfico y el diseño web creo que me gustaría también
6/7/20 23:48 - Lorena: Pero todo es tan complicado que necesitaría tiempo jaja
6/7/20 23:48 - Lorena: El maldito curso de 3D aún lo tengo
6/7/20 23:49 - Joe: I think you would like it too. The way you would send me revisions to my designs, it seemed like you were enjoying it.
6/7/20 23:49 - Lorena: Si bastante jajaj
6/7/20 23:49 - Lorena: No paraba de hacerte cambios
6/7/20 23:49 - Lorena: Jajaja pensarías, esta chica esta loca
6/7/20 23:49 - Lorena: Me escribe sin conocerme y me cambia el diseño de mi juego
6/7/20 23:50 - Joe: I'm sure the 3D course can be tied into web design. You can make 3D assets for websites i bet hahah all kinds of crazy stuff needed on websites now
6/7/20 23:51 - Joe: It was honestly one of the things that made me like you a lot more haha. I could just feel your passion about trying to make it look nice. You weren't being paid, you didn't have to do it, but you wanted to and you tried to do a good job regardless. I appreciated that a lot.
6/7/20 23:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:52 - Lorena: Jaja ohhh me vas a hacer  emocionar Joe jajajaj
6/7/20 23:53 - Joe: https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/adding-3d-models-to-your-website-d374a8cbbadd
6/7/20 23:53 - Lorena: Si realmente lo hice por vos, te veía tan ilusionado con ese juego que quería ayudar. Y disfruté con ello, cada vez que entraba veía algún cambio y el tiempo que te llevaba en hacerlo y lo valoraba más jaja
6/7/20 23:53 - Joe: the article makes it seem not that hard haha
6/7/20 23:54 - Joe: Give me 3D model files of like a small object and i might be able to figure it out hahah
6/7/20 23:54 - Joe: But what i was saying was you could just do the 3D modeling part as a part of a team. You'd send the file of the 3D model to the programmer to insert into the website
6/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Mmm
6/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Pero como es eso, una web con 3d, decime algún ejemplo de alguna
6/7/20 23:56 - Joe: I'm trying to find an example haha
6/7/20 23:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:58 - Joe: Yes
6/7/20 23:58 - Joe: Have you ever been to a website that lets you rotate a 3D image to look at all sides of it?
6/7/20 23:58 - Joe: You would be the one to make that 3D model
6/7/20 23:58 - Joe: I can't find an example right now
6/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Ah sí
6/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajaja no yo no quiero hacer eso
6/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
6/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: No me gusta demasiado modelar por mucho rato jajaj
7/7/20 0:00 - Joe: Yeah it seems frustrating. Probably why it pays well hah
7/7/20 0:00 - Joe: Well if you are ever desperate for a job that uses your new 3D modeling skills, look into it
7/7/20 0:01 - Joe: They can be short jobs to pad the resume haha. But i would support whatever you do 🤷‍♂️
7/7/20 0:01 - Lorena: Parece que puede gustarme, pero no especialmente.. jaja me agobio cuando la geometría no sale correcta. El ejercicio de me hace largo, sin embargo.. cuando maqueto paneles disfruto.. por ejemplo tipografías, colores, formas, organización de paneles, delinear planos también.. el 3d un rato.. me gusta más la parte de materiales, que la geometría en si jaja
7/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: * se me hace largo
7/7/20 0:02 - Joe: Aaah ok ok. You still need to send me more of your work so i can see it haha
7/7/20 0:03 - Lorena: Jaja es que no hice mucho más
7/7/20 0:03 - Lorena: Tengo que ponerme más tiempo pero con el trabajo me cuesta concentrarme el tiempo que estoy libre
7/7/20 0:03 - Lorena: Antes podía dedicar tiempo, ahora me cuesta, pero lo tengo en la cabeza todo el rato
7/7/20 0:03 - Joe: Oh yeah that's true. Back to real life haha
7/7/20 0:04 - Joe: That's cool you started it during quarantine though
7/7/20 0:04 - Lorena: la vida real no me deja hablar con vos bien, ni jugar a los dados, ni hacer el curso 3d jajaja
7/7/20 0:04 - Joe: I'm sure you'll get it eventually. It'll just be a little slower than before
7/7/20 0:05 - Lorena: Un poco antes la verdad, pero durante la cuarentena hubo una evolución considerable
7/7/20 0:05 - Joe: Let me know when you're ready for dice and we will play again hahah
7/7/20 0:05 - Joe: Maybe when it's not so late there
7/7/20 0:06 - Lorena: Gracias, intentaré hacerlo si.. estoy motivada por acabarlo entonces me pongo presión para sacar tiempo pero tengo que estar concentrada, no cansada jaja
7/7/20 0:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:07 - Joe: Definitely. I understand. I work best in the morning time so having to work camp in the morning makes it harder for me to do well with my programming.
7/7/20 0:08 - Joe: Oh we can play haha i just thought it was late there and you might want to go to sleep
7/7/20 0:08 - Joe: Or maybe not go to sleep yet, but not get kept up late by my dumb game 😂
7/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Jaja no tengo sueño todavía
7/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Es pronto y mañana no madrugo
7/7/20 0:09 - Lorena: Nunca me acuesto a esta hora cuando trabajo por la tarde
7/7/20 0:09 - Joe: haha then let's play 😈
7/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: 🤔
7/7/20 0:11 - Joe: Haha what's the room name?
7/7/20 0:11 - Lorena: Jaja el 5 debería estar en la misma línea 🙄
7/7/20 0:11 - Joe: Hahahahah dammit
7/7/20 0:12 - Joe: Oh i know the name. You're on mobile though so it was probably a capital "O"
7/7/20 0:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:13 - Lorena: Sabes que si al final voy a jugar intentaré sacar algo jajaja 🙊
7/7/20 0:13 - Joe: Hahaha
7/7/20 0:13 - Joe: It's ok. You are right in the end
7/7/20 0:14 - Joe: Aaah you got disconnected. My game still sucks. Sweet
7/7/20 0:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:14 - Lorena: No!!!
7/7/20 0:15 - Joe: Ok i made it. Lower case "o"
7/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Cómo?
7/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Es oso con minúsculas?
7/7/20 0:16 - Joe: Siii
7/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Antes funcionaba cuando ponía "Oso" desde el ordenador
7/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Okey voy
7/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Ah ya se pq no funcionaba
7/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Le daba al espacio
7/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Osea quedaba un espacio después de la letra, sabes?
7/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: El cursor digo jaja
7/7/20 0:18 - Joe: Oh haha yeah mobile is weird when entering the name of stuff for some reason
7/7/20 0:30 - Joe: I did too well hahah sorry 😬 I'll fix those dice on mobile, put them all in a row. Thanks for the tip!
7/7/20 0:30 - Lorena: Los dados en la misma línea
7/7/20 0:31 - Lorena: Y otra cosa pq tiene un sombreado en dado? El cuadrado sale como un fondo gris
7/7/20 0:31 - Lorena: Jaja no escribimos a la vez
7/7/20 0:31 - Lorena: *Nos
7/7/20 0:31 - Joe: Hmmm interesting. Maybe there is a border on the dice or something? I'll try to fix that
7/7/20 0:32 - Lorena: Si sale gris
7/7/20 0:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:33 - Joe: Oooooh yup that's probably a border or shadow setting. So it should just be flat looking dice right? No shadow or border would be better?
7/7/20 0:34 - Lorena: Claro sin borde, es que no se entiende que es la sombra
7/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Puede ser el borde negro así con el detalle en las esquinas redondeado y ya está
7/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Venga va .. una última partida
7/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Jaja
7/7/20 0:36 - Joe: You got disconnected from my room haha
7/7/20 0:36 - Lorena: Este es el único juego al que juego. Nunca jugué a nada de estas cosas, solo de pequeña
7/7/20 0:36 - Lorena: No.. si yo estoy ahí
7/7/20 0:36 - Joe: A while ago. That happens on mobile when you close the browser sometimes
7/7/20 0:37 - Joe: Nooooo totally disconnected. I know it doesn't look like it but that is only because my game sucks hahah
7/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: No lo cerré, le di a minimizar para responder un mensaje
7/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: Esperaaaa
7/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: Jajaj no te desesperes rulitos, voy a entrar
7/7/20 0:38 - Joe: hahah ok i wait
7/7/20 0:47 - Joe: Aaah disconnected.
7/7/20 0:48 - Joe: Was fun though hahah
7/7/20 0:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:48 - Lorena: Te iba a responder y pasó esto
7/7/20 0:48 - Joe: Oh your phone tried to reload the website i think
7/7/20 0:49 - Joe: I still haven't figured out how to fix that. Something to do with mobile. It never happens on computer. Or at least i haven't experienced it on a computer
7/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: Exacto
7/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: En la compu nunca hay error de este tipo
7/7/20 0:50 - Joe: I should make an actual app for use on mobile phones. That way i can teach myself that technology i was supposed to be using and hopefully fix some of these weird issues that happen with mobile browsers
7/7/20 0:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 0:58 - Joe: Hahaha I’m so sorry babe my dad was telling me something. I was distracted! I miss you I swear!!! Hahaha
7/7/20 0:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 1:00 - Lorena: Tendré que recibir un vídeo en compensación jajaja
7/7/20 1:01 - Joe: Hahaha
7/7/20 1:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 1:09 - Lorena: Lindo!
7/7/20 1:09 - Lorena: Te perdono jajaja
7/7/20 1:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: Que hacesss?
7/7/20 1:16 - Joe: Me? Trying to decide what to eat haha. I'm hella hungry right now
7/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: Jaja
7/7/20 1:18 - Joe: I should probably start looking for more remote work now too since this guy is not coming through
7/7/20 1:18 - Joe: After food haha
7/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Claro!
7/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Aprovecha
7/7/20 1:19 - Joe: Hopefully i find something soon. I like coding work haha
7/7/20 1:19 - Joe: What are you doing?
7/7/20 1:20 - Lorena: Seguro que encontrás, cualquier cosa te sirve
7/7/20 1:21 - Lorena: Yo en la cama, estaba poniéndome citronella para que no me pique los mosquitos, pero el olor no me gusta.. es muy fuerte
7/7/20 1:22 - Lorena: Y ya me voy a dormir, así que nadaa... Buenas noches👋
7/7/20 1:23 - Joe: Hahah dammit
7/7/20 1:23 - Joe: Ok babe sleep well. I'll talk to you later. Buenas noches
7/7/20 16:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 21:07 - Lorena: Eoo! Que tal?
7/7/20 21:12 - Joe: Just leaving work now! I’m freeee! Haha
7/7/20 21:12 - Joe: Such a short shift
7/7/20 21:12 - Lorena: Yo también, no puedo creer que coincidamos en un horario jajaja
7/7/20 21:15 - Joe: Haha the schedule actually works out for once
7/7/20 21:15 - Joe: It was so hot at the park today. I was dying. How was your day?
7/7/20 21:16 - Lorena: Jaja sí yo hoy pasé muchísimo calor también!
7/7/20 21:16 - Lorena: Mi día bien.. trabajé por la tarde, y por la mañana hice cosas en casa y me fui a depilar por primera vez con láser
7/7/20 21:17 - Lorena: Dios Joe que mal lo pasé, un dolor!!!! Lo aguanté pero tenía toda la cara llena de lágrimas jaja lloré de dolor
7/7/20 21:20 - Joe: Ooooh shit 😬
7/7/20 21:21 - Joe: Yeah it sounds painful haha. I can’t imagine
7/7/20 21:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 21:22 - Lorena: Es como si te apagan un cigarrillo en la piel, pero con un dolor muy punzante
7/7/20 21:23 - Lorena: Ingles completas( pussy, chichi, concha.. por si te interesa saberlo) y axilas
7/7/20 21:25 - Joe: Oh what?? That sounds terrible! People do such strange things sometimes haha
7/7/20 21:25 - Joe: Hahah niiiice 👍 😂
7/7/20 21:26 - Joe: I cannot imagine lasering my dick hahaha
7/7/20 21:26 - Joe: Fuck that would suck so bad
7/7/20 21:30 - Lorena: Jajaja si lo hago es para no depilarme nunca más jaja pero el próximo día voy con anestesia sin duda. Intenté ponerme música mientras la chica me lo hacía  . De hecho salió una de las canciones que me habías mandado vos, y ni por esas deje de pasarlo mal jajaj
7/7/20 21:31 - Lorena: Jaja en realidad lo decís por si querés saber las palabras como se dice jaja no para que lo sepas... Pero tendrás que espabilar amigo ...
7/7/20 21:32 - Lorena: Con niice 👍..  no
7/7/20 21:33 - Lorena: 🤷
7/7/20 21:36 - Joe: Damn it’s so bad you need anesthetic the next day!? What the hell Lore! Why would you do that? hahahah
7/7/20 21:38 - Joe: I actually just learned concha the other day on Instagram haha. So random
7/7/20 21:42 - Joe: No wait....it was “chocho” I learned. Damn there is a lot of ways to say it haha
7/7/20 21:46 - Lorena: Jaja sí, digo que no seas el nene de la pelota... niiice 🥱
7/7/20 21:46 - Lorena: Jajaj se puede saber cómo lo aprendiste?
7/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: Concha (uru-arg) Chocho/chichi/ (Esp)
7/7/20 21:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 21:49 - Joe: Haha I sent you the post on Instagram where I learned it chocho.
7/7/20 21:50 - Joe: Aaah ok. Noted. So I’m guessing you would use the word concha most out of all the options??
7/7/20 21:53 - Lorena: Jajaj no puedo creer que estés aprendiendo eso con los memes jaja bueno a ver si lo podés usar algún día
7/7/20 21:54 - Lorena: Si, yo digo concha/ conchita... Y alguna vez chichi( pero este con amigas)
7/7/20 21:58 - Joe: Haha the memes teach me a lot. Memes, music, and tv shows are my main sources of learning besides talking to you  😂
7/7/20 21:59 - Joe: I’ll try to remember that haha
7/7/20 22:01 - Joe: Dude my pinky finger hurts so bad. I think I sprained it 😣 I don’t know, it hurts to bend it now. I’m always injured haha
7/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:04 - Lorena: Y eso? Cuándo??
7/7/20 22:04 - Joe: Hahaha thanks 😂
7/7/20 22:04 - Joe: I just watch La Casa De Papel over and over hahaha and when I watch something in English I put Spanish subtitles
7/7/20 22:05 - Joe: Or if it has the option i put the audio in spanish if I’m watching a movie or something
7/7/20 22:05 - Lorena: Yo también quiero aprender 👂
7/7/20 22:06 - Lorena: Jajaja te voy a recomendar algo nuevo
7/7/20 22:06 - Joe: From earlier today. It’s just swollen like I jammed it. It’ll be fine in a few days
7/7/20 22:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:08 - Joe: Please do haha
7/7/20 22:09 - Joe: To answer your Instagram question....I can barely understand those people. Only some of what they are saying. I don’t understand most of it haha
7/7/20 22:10 - Lorena: Jajajajajajajajaja
7/7/20 22:10 - Lorena: Jajjajsj dios que risa
7/7/20 22:11 - Joe: I know she was asking people about if they send pictures of their cock and later if the women sent pictures of their pussy. And I understand some of the responses but most of the time I’m lost haha
7/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Demasiado dulce con esa voz diciendo las palabras sjajjaja
7/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Con el acento americano jakajajb
7/7/20 22:12 - Joe: Hahaha 🤷‍♂️
7/7/20 22:12 - Lorena: Ohhh, that sucks( como decís vos jaja)
7/7/20 22:13 - Lorena: Ahora las quiero aprender en inglés hay también? O solo una manera de decirlo?
7/7/20 22:14 - Joe: Hmmmm let me think 🤔 . There isn’t as many ways in English haha.
7/7/20 22:15 - Lorena: Jaja bueno la gente es básica respondiendo, pero hace gracia la manera de decirlo
7/7/20 22:15 - Lorena: Uno que hace gestos me hizo gracia jajajaja
7/7/20 22:16 - Lorena: Las chicas mienten jaja, algunas... Que rabia que todo sea así tan machista que no puedan decirlo
7/7/20 22:16 - Lorena: 👂
7/7/20 22:16 - Joe: Hahaha
7/7/20 22:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:18 - Joe: Hahaha sorry there aren’t many. I mean, there are a lot of slang words for them that no one uses
7/7/20 22:20 - Joe: Haha I was wondering what you would think of the girls answers 😂
7/7/20 22:20 - Joe: Yeah it would be nice if everyone could just be honest without feeling super judged.
7/7/20 22:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:23 - Lorena: Solo había escuchado pussy y dick jaja tengo que aprender esas otras
7/7/20 22:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:25 - Joe: Hahah yeah that was good. You had the last one right. “Coochie” haha
7/7/20 22:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 22:30 - Lorena: Jajaja que cara sale en el video de inicio como tonta jaja 🥴
7/7/20 22:33 - Joe: I listened to this so many times 😂 but yeah that’s crazy stuff like that is still going on. Poor education or bad parenting, who knows but hopefully the world is moving in the right direction over time
7/7/20 22:34 - Joe: You look good to me as usual
7/7/20 22:46 - Lorena: Decía que a una ex compañera del trabajo, un chico de enfadó con ella y se hizo un Instagram falso, con sus fotos, algunas desnuda y agregó a todos sus amigos y contactos de trabajo. Un hijo de puta
7/7/20 22:48 - Lorena: Estamos solos con rogel jaja echo de menos a las chicas 🙁 jaja
7/7/20 22:49 - Joe: Lonely Lore haha. How long are they gone for?
7/7/20 22:50 - Joe: Oh yeah after the 1000th time listening I understood the situation. Super messed up what he did!
7/7/20 22:52 - Joe: They made a law here in the states that would classify what he did as “revenge porn” since he posted nudes cause that kind of stuff was a huge problem. Now you can go to jail for doing stuff like that.
7/7/20 22:52 - Lorena: Tres días jaja pero normalmente siempre hacemos la cena juntas jaja ahora solo estoy picoteando cosas con la cerveza relax jajaja
7/7/20 22:53 - Lorena: Me parece genial
7/7/20 22:54 - Lorena: Una chica hace unos años se suicidó acá porque un compañero de trabajo publicó un video de ella teniendo sexo o chupándosela y lo vio toda su empresa  ...
7/7/20 22:54 - Joe: Oh damn so you’re alone for a few days then. Well....with only Rogel haha
7/7/20 22:55 - Lorena: Si rogel hoy se hizo pis en el sofá estuve enfadada con el pero luego se siente culpable jaja así que tengo que perdonarlo rápido
7/7/20 22:56 - Joe: Holy shit, gnarly. Yeah I think it is a good law. Especially with how people send those kind of pictures or videos to each other nowadays. Very common.
7/7/20 22:56 - Joe: Shit....you even got me to send a video 😬
7/7/20 22:57 - Lorena: 😈😈😈
7/7/20 22:57 - Lorena: Jajaja tú vídeo solo lo veo yo. Jamás publicaría eso!
7/7/20 22:57 - Joe: The protection is needed though. So many people do messed up stuff like share those pictures or videos when they get upset or breakup with a person. Or they send it to a friend and it spreads fast. Either way, people are messed up sometimes
7/7/20 22:58 - Joe: I have all the trust in the world for you
7/7/20 22:59 - Lorena: Es tremendo, te puede joder la vida. Yo no sé cómo reaccionaria, pero sin duda sería algo humillante. Aunque intentaría machacar públicamente a ese hijo de puta y mostrarlo como algo normal para que otras chicas no sientan eso
7/7/20 23:00 - Lorena: Yo también en vos, mucha! No me imaginaria que termines publicando algo o pasándole a tus amigos
7/7/20 23:00 - Lorena: Eso espero jaja 🙏
7/7/20 23:03 - Joe: I hope you are never in that situation but I feel like you would handle it well and the boy would end up regretting his decision
7/7/20 23:04 - Joe: What you send to me is for my eyes only! I’d never show anyone haha
7/7/20 23:08 - Lorena: Jaja la verdad es que no voy enviando cosas
7/7/20 23:10 - Lorena: Y si lo hice fue con confíanza, y nadie que haya tenido en mi vida creo que se comporte así
7/7/20 23:11 - Lorena: Cuando lo repetimos? Jaja
7/7/20 23:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 23:14 - Joe: Hahah I don’t knoooow 😂 now? Or whenever you send me more sexy stuff haha you get me “worked up”
7/7/20 23:14 - Lorena: Jajaja a lo mejor es verdad, pero lo dudo.. igual por la familia o algo de eso o vergüenza
7/7/20 23:14 - Lorena: Yo creo que diría la verdad con educación claro, jaja mi padre y mi hermano me dirían algo seguro .. Lorena! 🙊
7/7/20 23:15 - Lorena: Jaja vos también podés enviar esas cosas para hacerme "trabajar"
7/7/20 23:16 - Joe: Hahah I am not sexy like you though 😂
7/7/20 23:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 23:19 - Joe: It’s easier when you make a request haha. I don’t even know what is sexy to you hahah. Fuck I’m the worst 🤦‍♂️
7/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: Ahí va
7/7/20 23:20 - Joe: Hahahahahaha
7/7/20 23:20 - Joe: 💩
7/7/20 23:21 - Lorena: Boludo se la tuve que arrancar con una rama
7/7/20 23:21 - Lorena: Jajaja le voy a decir a Luchi que esto no está pagado jajaj
7/7/20 23:27 - Joe: Aaaah haha gross 😝
7/7/20 23:28 - Joe: Rogel with his little poopoo butt hahaha
7/7/20 23:28 - Joe: Luchi owes you one
7/7/20 23:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
7/7/20 23:34 - Lorena: Jajajaja
7/7/20 23:34 - Lorena: Te estaba preparando
7/7/20 23:35 - Lorena: Pero rogel llevaba mucho rato sacudiendo el culo y esa caca no se caia al suelo jajaj
7/7/20 23:38 - Lorena: Pero te apetece? Jaja es que nunca lo decís vos
7/7/20 23:39 - Joe: What don't i say?
7/7/20 23:39 - Joe: That i want to have sexy time with you? hahah
7/7/20 23:39 - Joe: cause i do
7/7/20 23:44 - Lorena: Jaja que nunca decís vos de hacerlo, te provoco yo jaja
7/7/20 23:49 - Joe: Haha I’m easily provoked by you. I’m really sorry. Half of it is me being shy and not knowing what to even send you. And the other half is the schedule. I’m hornier in the morning and evening I guess 🤷‍♂️
7/7/20 23:49 - Joe: Ejsoixdjeis I feel like I disappoint you haha fuck 🤦‍♂️
7/7/20 23:52 - Lorena: Jajaja osea que este no es tu horario 😅
7/7/20 23:53 - Lorena: De estar horny jaja
7/7/20 23:53 - Lorena: Yo por las mañanas tambiénn, y luego depende el día
7/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Nahhh, solo te lo digo pq me gustó las veces que lo hicimos y pq veo que no podés estar acá ... Entonces de vez en cuando puede ser una manera para que estemos más unidos jaja  , no sé...
7/7/20 23:55 - Joe: I can’t lie, morning sex is kind of my favorite 🙊🙈
7/7/20 23:57 - Joe: Haha it’s just a little more work to get in the mood in the middle of the day 😆 plus I get so sleepy afterwards hahaha
7/7/20 23:57 - Joe: Yeah I know what you mean
8/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: 😬😬😬
8/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jaja recibido!
8/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: No problemm
8/7/20 0:07 - Lorena: Tu día hoy bien? Supiste algo de ese chico o aún sigue desparecido?
8/7/20 0:09 - Joe: Today is alright. Nothing special haha. The guy never got back to me. Disappeared 😡
8/7/20 0:10 - Joe: And when the hell is Spain going to start letting US citizens visit!? Right now it’s no go. I think they do another update in a week or so
8/7/20 0:11 - Joe: I just want to buy my ticket and go see you
8/7/20 0:14 - Lorena: Nada, olvidate de el, poco serio. Ya aparecerá
8/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Mmm ojalá, pero lamentablemente acá hay rumores que es posible un rebrote y otro encierro. Hay comunidades en España que ya vuelven al confinamiento
8/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Las clases en sept en las universidades y colegios están preparadas para ser a distancia por las dudas...
8/7/20 0:17 - Joe: This sucks
8/7/20 0:18 - Joe: We’ll have to meet in Costa Rica haha
8/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: No sabemos que es lo que va a pasar, pero es un mierda... Yo de verdad quería verte
8/7/20 0:20 - Joe: Even if everything goes to shit and we can’t be together I’ll visit you someday. Even if it’s far in the future and we can only be friends I would still love to visit you. But that’s not what I want. I want to see you sooner rather than later haha
8/7/20 0:20 - Joe: I’m trying to do all I can to get to you but the situation of the world is fucked. I have one goal right now haha get to Spain to see you
8/7/20 0:26 - Lorena: Ohh sos tan transparente al hablar y tú actitud que no me gustaría que seas solo mi amigo, aunque igual si pasa mucho tiempo tendré que aceptar que sea así
8/7/20 0:29 - Lorena: Lo sé, te juro que estoy deseando que tengas el pasaporte y el viaje para poder verte jajaj Joe nos tenemos que ver,  si o si. Esta pandemia pasará y la gente podrá viajar..
8/7/20 0:31 - Joe: I really really don’t want to just be friends. I just don’t want to keep you waiting for too long haha it’s hard to explain. 

But you’re who I want and I want you as more than a friend.
8/7/20 0:34 - Joe: You’re right. It’ll happen eventually! But It feels like it has been so long already that we’ve been talking. I just really want to go to you now haha the ultimate test of patience 😂
8/7/20 9:53 - Lorena: Me quedé super dormida!!!!
8/7/20 10:03 - Joe: All good. I was sleeping well until my aunt from Hawaii arrived haha. My dad just picked her up from the airport. They’re in the other room talking hellaaaa loud!
8/7/20 10:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:05 - Lorena: Jajaja
8/7/20 10:06 - Lorena: Bueno yo te escribo en respuesta a lo de ayer y ya lo lees cuando no estés dormido jajaj
8/7/20 10:06 - Lorena: Ahora te mandaré algún video d buenos días
8/7/20 10:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:12 - Joe: 😊
8/7/20 10:12 - Joe: Rogel gets all the love haha jealous
8/7/20 10:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:16 - Lorena: Jajaja durmió conmigo, debajo de las sábanas se ponían en mi tripa
8/7/20 10:17 - Lorena: Para vos también hay amor a distancia jjj
8/7/20 10:18 - Lorena: Entonces si ninguno de los dos queremos ser amigos, no lo seremos. Jaja (solo amigos)
8/7/20 10:20 - Joe: Haha hella sweet
8/7/20 10:20 - Lorena: Si es que llevamos mucho tiempo hablando.. y con este horario nuevo da la sensación que más jaja.. pero si vos realmente tenés ganas de vernos, sabes que yo también. No importa esperar, lo haré.. pq se que sos algo bueno y en algún momento llegarás jajaj
8/7/20 10:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:22 - Joe: Damn you’re the best haha sounds good to me. I’ll keep checking the status of travel until they’ll let me come see you haha
8/7/20 10:23 - Joe: They can’t stop us forever 😂
8/7/20 10:25 - Lorena: Esa es la actitud! 💪
8/7/20 10:26 - Lorena: No pienses que me haces esperar, sé que estás haciendo lo posible
8/7/20 10:27 - Lorena: Lo único es que me da mucha rabia cuando alguien me dice que cerrarán las fronteras o escucho noticias de rebrotes jajaj
8/7/20 10:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:28 - Joe: Hahaha this is me when someone says I’m not allowed to travel to Spain
8/7/20 10:30 - Joe: Thaaaanks. Yeah I’m trying haha
8/7/20 10:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:33 - Lorena: Jajaja
8/7/20 10:33 - Lorena: Si y cunado escucho algo de USA de coronavirus es como...
8/7/20 10:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:34 - Lorena: *cuando
8/7/20 10:35 - Joe: Hahah we are doing a terrible job here. It sucks. I bet that will make us one of the last countries that Spain opens the border for 🤬🤬
8/7/20 10:35 - Lorena: Bah acá lo están haciendo re mal también
8/7/20 10:36 - Lorena: El gobierno y principalmente la gente
8/7/20 10:36 - Lorena: El otro día un compañero me dijo que fue a una discoteca y que todo el mundo estaba sin mascarilla! Imagínate ....
8/7/20 10:37 - Joe: Oh god dammit what the hell people!
8/7/20 10:38 - Joe: It’s so hard to get so many humans to work towards a single goal. This virus stuff needs to be over. Ugh this is ridiculous
8/7/20 10:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:40 - Lorena: Si, acá muchísimos así
8/7/20 10:40 - Lorena: O gente que viene a mi tienda y se deja la nariz fuera
8/7/20 10:40 - Lorena: Y yo...
8/7/20 10:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 10:41 - Joe: Hahaha I hate seeing the mask on someone’s face with the nose out! So stupid! Crazy world 😂
8/7/20 10:43 - Joe: It makes me wonder if they are just wearing it to be technically following the rules, but they really don’t want to wear it. Or if they’re just not very educated and don’t know what they’re doing. I guess the answer could be a little of both haha
8/7/20 10:47 - Lorena: Totalmente....! Igual las mascarillas son d solo un uso, se de que gente que las usa más horas...pero es difícil.. a mí en algún momento me pasó de no tener más y no me da tiempo de ir a la farmacia
8/7/20 10:47 - Lorena: Pero hay que ser consciente.. es que me da tanta pena boludo como los médicos y enfermeros intentaron combatir todo esto y la gente no valora una mierda
8/7/20 10:48 - Lorena: Y la gente que perdió sus negocios, eso me mata. Con el esfuerzo que lleva un emprendimiento y algo tan lindo.. que ya no puedas sostenerlo ...
8/7/20 10:50 - Joe: Yeah I have a lot of family that works in hospitals so I don’t appreciate people’s negligence haha
8/7/20 10:50 - Lorena: Escucha y tu familia, tus abuelos y eso.. salen de casa?
8/7/20 10:50 - Joe: And I really want to have my own business one day. It’s super difficult as it is. I can’t imagine having something I worked hard to build get crushed because of something completely out of my control
8/7/20 10:52 - Lorena: Si es horrible, es que es tal cual, fuera de tu control...
8/7/20 10:52 - Lorena: Que te gustaría emprender?
8/7/20 10:52 - Joe: My family has been pretty good about staying home. And no one really visits my grandparents right now cause they’re scared to get them sick
8/7/20 10:53 - Joe: I don’t know. But I don’t like working for other people and I feel like I can find someway to create value in the world
8/7/20 10:54 - Lorena: Claro, es lo correcto. Mi madre me dijo que tengo que ir menos a casa por la abuela.. que si me voy de vacaciones vaya antes..no después.. raro jaja 😭
8/7/20 10:54 - Lorena: Por ejemplo....?
8/7/20 10:55 - Lorena: Algo de codificación? Algo de skatecamp? O algo diferente?
8/7/20 10:55 - Joe: Mmm well technically I already started a business. I have one for my freelance coding stuff.
8/7/20 10:56 - Joe: But yeah other than that, maybe a store, online and/or in real life, not sure. But I don’t know what I would sell haha.
8/7/20 10:57 - Lorena: Jajaja
8/7/20 10:57 - Joe: Hahah I know I’m terrible 😆
8/7/20 10:58 - Lorena: Una online mejor, una física es 🤯
8/7/20 10:59 - Joe: Haha true. We’ll see.
8/7/20 10:59 - Lorena: Si yo también quiero emprender, no me gusta trabajar para otros
8/7/20 11:00 - Joe: I wish I had a better idea of what business I want to create but it’s pretty hard to come up with a solid business plan for a lot of ideas haha
8/7/20 11:00 - Lorena: Pero si me gusta tener un equipo, y trabajar con más gente. Así que trabajarían para mí jaja y les podría unas buenas condiciones para que estén contentos
8/7/20 11:01 - Lorena: A mí me gustaría un hostel boutique... O comprar casas, reformarlas y luego venderlas..."tipo inmobiliaria"
8/7/20 11:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 11:02 - Lorena: Jamás!!!!! Jajaja
8/7/20 11:03 - Joe: Oooh Ok. Those ideas would be cool. I thought about doing something like that. Be a bed and breakfast host or something hahah
8/7/20 11:05 - Joe: Alright babe everyone finally went to bed so I can sleep now. I’m glad we got to talk a little extra today though haha
8/7/20 11:05 - Lorena: Sii, solo te quita tiempo las reservas.. podés estar haciendo trabajos por tu cuenta
8/7/20 11:05 - Lorena: Y la gente no va con energía mala porque está de vacaciones 😅
8/7/20 11:06 - Joe: Hahah that’s true. It would be nice to work where most people are already happy 😆
8/7/20 11:07 - Joe: Ok I’m going to sleeeeep now 😴
8/7/20 11:07 - Lorena: Jjjj muy bien bombón, descansa!!! Buenas nochesss
8/7/20 11:07 - Joe: Gooodnight 😘
8/7/20 11:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 16:36 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 18:03 - Lorena: Jajja buenoos días rulitos!!! Miss you too! 🌼🥰 suertee
8/7/20 18:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 18:38 - Joe: Hahaha more like a sleepy voice 😂
8/7/20 18:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 21:05 - Lorena: Jajaja te llevas bien con los niños
8/7/20 21:08 - Joe: Hahah just the ones that actually like skateboarding. The ones that don’t want to be there probably hate me 😂
8/7/20 21:09 - Lorena: Jaja no entiendo como mandan a niños que no quieran ir jaja
8/7/20 21:11 - Lorena: Bueno ese niño seguro lo está pasando bien y además comiendo. Y vos también niño adulto jajaja
8/7/20 21:21 - Joe: Happens all the time haha. Parents have to go to work and just pick a camp they think the kid will like
8/7/20 21:22 - Joe: Hahah I’m a man child 😂
8/7/20 21:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
8/7/20 21:24 - Joe: Today was pretty fun though. I got an offer to teach a couple of kids private lessons next week. 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. Should make up for not getting that other job a little bit haha
8/7/20 21:27 - Lorena: Jajaja espero no ser así cuando sea madre y poder elegir un campamento que le guste
8/7/20 21:28 - Lorena: 😂
8/7/20 21:28 - Lorena: Sii? Que biennn! Menos preocupaciones seguro jaja qué tal son los niños?
8/7/20 21:32 - Joe: Haha same when I’m a dad. I don’t think it’s on purpose. The parents and even the kids might think they’ll like it but when they find out how hard it is and how much they get hurt some lose interest
8/7/20 21:33 - Joe: It’s two kids that are in camp this week. Honestly they’re some of my least favorite kids haha but the parents are paying good
8/7/20 21:34 - Lorena: Jajajaja
8/7/20 21:35 - Lorena: Bueno seguro con ellos ahora estarás más unido, el dinero lo hará jajaj

8/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: Si, con pequeñas cosas pero importantes para el que las disfruta
8/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: Me hace sonreír mucho cuando lo veo, digo que niño tan genial " Dieguito"
8/7/20 22:04 - Joe: Haha that’s definitely a video you can watch to help get in a better mood. How can you stay mad watching that little dude be so happy?? Haha impossible

9/7/20 0:13 - Lorena: Que le pasó a Dookie???
9/7/20 0:15 - Joe: I don’t know. He hasn’t been eating much lately and didn’t seem well. My dad found him upstairs this morning
9/7/20 0:16 - Joe: We’re going to bury him in the backyard now
9/7/20 0:17 - Joe: Poor little Dookie 😔

9/7/20 2:07 - Lorena: Cómo estás? Tu familia?
9/7/20 2:07 - Lorena: Se que es un animal, pero muchas veces forman parte de la familia. No sé cuántos años tenía Dookie..
9/7/20 2:12 - Joe: We’re good. It’s just me and my dad here. My mom went with my aunt up north to see my cousin. We had dookie for almost 10 years. He was definitely a part of the family.
9/7/20 2:13 - Joe: Este mensaje fue eliminado
9/7/20 2:14 - Joe: So weird though. I totally didn’t think he was going to die
9/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Ya, ni yo.. recuerdo cuando me lo enseñaste en video que estaba un poquito raro
9/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Lo siento mucho Joe, de verdad
9/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Te daría un gran abrazo
9/7/20 2:43 - Joe: I really appreciate you. Thanks a lot. It sucks but that’s life. There is always an end 😔
9/7/20 7:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

9/7/20 15:16 - Joe: Buenos días. I fell asleep pretty early last night.
9/7/20 15:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/7/20 19:26 - Joe: Duuude my coworker fell so hard I had to write an accident report on it. He scraped his face on the ground 😬
9/7/20 19:26 - Joe: Hope your day is going smoother than mine haha
9/7/20 19:56 - Lorena: Hola!
9/7/20 19:56 - Lorena: Que putada!
9/7/20 19:57 - Lorena: Esta bien o fue muy fuerte? Quien tu compañero de trabajo, el que firmaste que se parece a Shelby?
9/7/20 20:47 - Joe: Hahah yeah the one that looks like Shelby. He is ok. Just had a cut under his eye. Could’ve been worse I guess
9/7/20 20:57 - Lorena: Filmaste
9/7/20 20:58 - Lorena: Me tiene harta el traductor jajaja
9/7/20 20:58 - Lorena: Pobrecito espero que no sea nada
9/7/20 21:08 - Joe: jahah sí el traductor no es tan divertido cuando tienes que usarlo. Lo siento. Voy a enviar mensajes ya traducidos por un rato para que no lo necesites
9/7/20 21:11 - Lorena: Nono no lo decís por vos
9/7/20 21:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/7/20 21:11 - Lorena: Jajaja por mi! Que parece que no se escribir ... Puse firmaste en vez de filmaste
9/7/20 21:12 - Lorena: Normalmente me entienden pero vos si lo pones en traductor vas a entender cualquier cosa jajaj
9/7/20 21:12 - Lorena: Hella igual jajaja
9/7/20 21:18 - Joe: Oh hahaha is it because I read it and disappear for a while to translate? My bad 😂
9/7/20 21:18 - Lorena: Que??
9/7/20 21:19 - Joe: Nevermiiiind haha
9/7/20 21:19 - Joe: Voy a cubrir unas horas en el parque. Así que estoy aquí por 3 horas más para monitorear
9/7/20 21:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/7/20 21:20 - Lorena: Jaja me refería a esto
9/7/20 21:20 - Lorena: Al que firmaste no! Al que filmaste! Jaja no es lo mismo. Firmar que Filmar
9/7/20 21:21 - Lorena: Por eso decía que estoy harta del traductor de mi teléfono que me escribo una cosa y me pone otra. Y claro, alguien que entienda español, lo entiende. Pero si vos intentas entenderlo o traducirlo, tiene otro significado
9/7/20 21:21 - Joe: Aaaaah ok ok
9/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: Que tal hoy el trabajo?
9/7/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/7/20 21:54 - Joe: Hahahaha
9/7/20 21:55 - Joe: 😂
9/7/20 21:55 - Joe: Good. I’m just sitting in the shade right now keeping an eye on the park
9/7/20 21:55 - Joe: Easy work
9/7/20 22:12 - Lorena: Muy bien, yo recién saqué a Rogel a hacer pis
9/7/20 22:13 - Lorena: Hoy fue bueno y no hizo caca ni pis en la casa
9/7/20 22:19 - Joe: Haha that’s a relief 😅
9/7/20 22:20 - Joe: I think I like working at the skatepark too much hahah all I do is skate around or sit all day haha. I used to use them time to learn stuff when they’d let me sit in the building but now i have to be in the park or at the front all the time
9/7/20 22:30 - Lorena: Jaja eso es bueno! Trabajar en lo que te gusta, me alegro!!
9/7/20 22:38 - Joe: Haha thanks. Getting paid to skate is awesome. The only time it’s not fun is when a parent gets mad when I tell them their kid can’t ride a scooter or bike at the park haha
9/7/20 22:39 - Joe: Some people get so upset when I tell them no but I’m just doing my job 🤷‍♂️
9/7/20 22:40 - Lorena: Jajaja me suena
9/7/20 22:41 - Lorena: Cuánto llevas trabajando de profe de skate?
9/7/20 22:44 - Joe: Mmmm 4 years now
9/7/20 22:45 - Joe: Well I’ve been working 4 years at the skatepark but I’ve only done 3 years of lessons. The first year I just did monitoring of the park
9/7/20 22:52 - Lorena: Que bien, ya es tiempo! Te divertis y encima te pagan, es un lujo eso
9/7/20 23:01 - Joe: Haha yeah and every time I leave I tell them not to fire me so I can work next summer if I come back.
10/7/20 0:01 - Joe: Some lady just asked me to tutor her kid 😂 like not in skateboarding but actually tutor them for school haha. Weird
10/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: 🙄
10/7/20 0:42 - Lorena: Cómo? Que le des clases a su hijo, pero el ya está apuntado no?
10/7/20 0:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/7/20 0:49 - Joe: Hahahah whaaaat??
10/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
10/7/20 0:51 - Joe: The kids mom talked to me today while I was monitoring the park and asked if I would be interested in tutoring her son. He isn’t in camp or anything. I’ve seen that kid at the park a few times and his mom knows that he likes me so she thought it would be easier for me to teach him his school stuff instead of her 😂
10/7/20 0:58 - Joe: Hahaha you look hella sleepy
10/7/20 1:00 - Lorena: Jaja ahhh! Pero bien no? Eso es más trabajo, los padres te ven bueno para entretener a sus hijos jaja
10/7/20 1:01 - Joe: Haha yeah you look beautiful as always!
10/7/20 1:02 - Joe: I am a little worried about how much work teaching actual school work is going to be haha
10/7/20 1:02 - Joe: But I’m willing to try it out and see how it goes. We’ll do like 25 minutes of school then take a skateboard break and repeat haha
10/7/20 1:03 - Lorena: Jaja con la camiseta arrugada y me levanté con una pierna levantada de la malla.. no sé como..pero me gusta dormir jaja
10/7/20 1:04 - Lorena: 🥰
10/7/20 1:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
10/7/20 1:06 - Lorena: Pero ya empezaste no? o van a cambiar los horarios del campamento?
10/7/20 1:06 - Lorena: 😂😂
10/7/20 1:08 - Joe: No this would be a new thing. The mom just asked me this today and got my phone number. The kid is not a part of camp. It would probably be in the afternoon after I’m done working camp
10/7/20 1:12 - Lorena: Si eso lo entendí, pero no entendí pq estabas un poco preocupado, por el horario del trabajo del skatepark? Para compaginarlo?
10/7/20 1:13 - Joe: Ooh haha sorry. I’m worried because teaching school work isn’t the same as teaching skateboarding. Or maybe it is? I don’t know haha.
10/7/20 1:14 - Lorena: Ahhhhh
10/7/20 1:14 - Joe: I just don’t want to do a bad job and it would be my first time doing something like that
10/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: Que boluda no había entendido, estaba dormida antes y no leí que era del colegio
10/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: Pero te ofreció que lo ayudes a hacer sus deberes?
10/7/20 1:16 - Joe: Yeah she wants me to help him study and do school work. With skateboarding breaks in between.
10/7/20 1:17 - Joe: She said she was having a hard time getting him interested in learning anything for school during quarantine
10/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: Pero y como vas. Hacer el?
10/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: *Pero y como vas a hacer eso?
10/7/20 1:17 - Joe: Actually she said “I tried to teach him for the first 2 months of quarantine and we almost killed each other” 😬
10/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Jajaja
10/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Pobre madre
10/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Que edad tiene el niño?
10/7/20 1:18 - Joe: He is in 1st grade so everything I have to teach him is supposed to be easy
10/7/20 1:19 - Joe: Not sure how old first grade is. 6 or 7 maybe?
10/7/20 1:19 - Lorena: Pero cómo vas a ayudarlo en el skatepark? Se concentrará? Vos no podrías estar pendiente de vigilar el skatepark no? Debería ser fuera dw tu horario o como?
10/7/20 1:20 - Lorena: Jaja es que acá es diferente
10/7/20 1:21 - Joe: Yeah she sounded like she needed help haha. But also she is a white lady and her kid is brown and she was like “I think it would be good for an older boy to help him. Especially someone that looks like him. And he seems to have gravitated towards you”. 

I’m down to try it 🤷‍♂️
10/7/20 1:21 - Lorena: Bueno acá sería primer año de primaria esa edad yo creo
10/7/20 1:22 - Joe: We’re going to schedule something when I’m not working the skatepark. I don’t think we’ll be at the skatepark when I teach him either. Probably just going to skate near his house
10/7/20 1:22 - Lorena: 💛
10/7/20 1:23 - Joe: Yeah that’s what it is. I mean we also do “kindergarten” but that’s more like daycare disguised as school for 5 year olds haha
10/7/20 1:24 - Lorena: Jaja me encanta, me imagino que los niños se te dan genial. Este seguramente te vea cómo modelo y puedas ayudarlo con cosas de clase como si fueses un hermano mayor.. la madre pensó bien yo creo
10/7/20 1:26 - Lorena: eso de disfrazada jaja de acuerdo
10/7/20 1:27 - Joe: Haha hopefully. I’ll let you know how it goes. She might not even contact me 🤷‍♂️
10/7/20 1:29 - Joe: She’ll flake like the other guy haha and the only ones who will be true to their word is the 2 little devils I’m supposed to give skate lessons to hahaha I’m really thinking about cancelling those lessons. Those kids are not pleasant 😂

10/7/20 8:06 - Joe: Haha buenos días. Glad you like the videos.
10/7/20 8:07 - Joe: I don’t know why, but even though we talked about sending messages anytime I still try not to send too many when I know you’re asleep haha but I’ll take note that you like waking up to a message or video
10/7/20 8:07 - Lorena: Dios también le daría besos a socks es taaaan linda, esa cara por favor..

10/7/20 8:13 - Lorena: Jjjjj
10/7/20 8:13 - Lorena: Que hiciste hoy, exactamente?
10/7/20 8:15 - Joe: I worked at the park from 8:30-3 then I came home and did some coding. Took a nap. Ate food. Went to my friends house. I think that was it 🤔
10/7/20 8:17 - Lorena: Jaja muy bien lo bueno del skatepark es que acabas prontob
10/7/20 8:20 - Joe: Yeah I have a lot of time during the day. I need to start building a new website or something to fill the time. I’ve just been doing “coding challenges” where you try to solve the problem given to you.
10/7/20 8:21 - Joe: But right now I’m super sleepy haha. I’m going to bed now 😴
10/7/20 8:21 - Joe: Have a good day! I’ll talk to you soon 😘
10/7/20 8:23 - Lorena: Muy bien! Vas avanzando así para cuando encuentres otro trabajo de codificación

11/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Ahhhh jaja sí la gente estuvo mucho tiempo encerrada y ahora hasta dinero

11/7/20 0:45 - Joe: Haha you made that for him? He has a little throne to sit on now
11/7/20 0:45 - Joe: I like the little skull dog tag he has
11/7/20 0:46 - Lorena: Jajaj si a el le gusta estar un poco alto .. así que agarre una pieza del sofá y la cubrí con la tela
11/7/20 0:47 - Lorena: A mí me parece ridícula esa placa, pero me hace gracia que la tenga el ... Jaja es como todo menos peligroso, es un perro mimado 🤭
11/7/20 0:51 - Joe: I think it’s funny cause it’s a skull tag on a little tiny not very dangerous dog.  I like that haha
11/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 0:52 - Joe: That’s sweet haha he looks so satisfied being on top of it

11/7/20 1:03 - Joe: Yeah I just don’t really like to post stuff I guess. I’ll just keep the photos and videos for myself. I share them you instead haha
11/7/20 1:06 - Lorena: Soy "adicta" a tus fotos y vídeos que me envías 😂
11/7/20 1:11 - Joe: Hahah I send so much of me doing absolutely nothing. Or hanging out with the dogs. I never know what to send you but I want you to see me. I’ve sent a lot of stuff but I’m going to keep sending things until you tell me to stop haha
11/7/20 1:16 - Lorena: Jajaj si los vídeos que nos enviamos son naturales y al momento, aunque no hacemos mucho ..pero a mí me gustan así te veoooo
11/7/20 1:21 - Joe: I send them when I can haha I’ve been trying to remember to do it more often. I also want to send more of me practicing Spanish.

11/7/20 16:02 - Joe: Haha yeah it’s not bad. Plus my friends like to sleep in so they’ll barely be ready for the day when I’m getting off work.
11/7/20 16:02 - Joe: Hurray! What’s the plan for the rest of your day?
11/7/20 16:06 - Lorena: Jaja saliste de fiesta ya? O se quedan en casa hasta tarde?
11/7/20 16:06 - Lorena: Sierraaaa

11/7/20 16:08 - Lorena: Hay rebajas ahora jaja a ver si veo algún vestido o bikini para la playita
11/7/20 16:10 - Joe: I’m not doing any partying 🤷‍♂️ i go to my close friends houses and chill but that’s about it. 

I don’t think they’re partying either. Just lazy and wake up late
11/7/20 16:11 - Joe: Haha of course. Have fun!
11/7/20 16:11 - Joe: Damn that’s hella cheap haha. Good find. Send pictures later 😆
11/7/20 16:12 - Joe: Oh yeah everyone has to clear that inventory that’s been sitting. Time for good deals. I’m sure you’ll find some great stuff
11/7/20 16:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 16:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 16:14 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
11/7/20 16:15 - Joe: Haha alright babe I have to get on the road now! I’ll message you when I’m bored at work but I’ll be driving for a little while. I’ll talk to you soooon
11/7/20 16:15 - Lorena: Nosotras también hacemos lo mismo, ya no salimos de fiesta.. disfrutamos del campo o en casa.. excepto cuando vamos a la playa que ahí sí que igual salimos a algún bar con ambiente
11/7/20 16:16 - Lorena: como cuando estés aburrido.. jajaj Joee 😣
11/7/20 16:17 - Lorena: Vaaale, vale hablame cuando quieras estaré de viaje a la sierra . Que se haga ameno ese rato en el skatepark! 🛹😘
11/7/20 16:18 - Joe: Hahaha that sounded bad.sorry hahah
11/7/20 16:18 - Joe: Not just when I’m bored 😂
11/7/20 16:18 - Joe: Ok I miss you I’ll talk to you super soon 😘
11/7/20 16:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 16:19 - Lorena: Jajja tranqui, todo bien. Un besitoo byee 🥰
11/7/20 16:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Gordi estás negro
11/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Jajaj
11/7/20 17:03 - Lorena: No hay nadie está re tranqui
11/7/20 17:10 - Joe: Hahaha I’m getting a little dark being out here everyday 😂
11/7/20 17:11 - Joe: It’s super nice. Except I burned my tongue with my coffee hahah shit
11/7/20 17:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 17:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 17:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 17:35 - Joe: Mmmmm I want some 😋
11/7/20 17:41 - Lorena: Jaja le dije al chico leche templada unas gotitas y me quema el café la mano
11/7/20 17:42 - Lorena: Q tipo de donut te gusta a vos? Yo casi siempre pido el clásico pero relleno de dulce de leche ( típico de Uru y arg)
11/7/20 17:50 - Joe: I usually get regular glazed doughnuts or doughnut holes haha
11/7/20 17:50 - Joe: Super plain
11/7/20 18:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 18:01 - Lorena: Doughnuts 😂 en español lo cambiamos un poquito jajaj Donuts 🤣
11/7/20 18:03 - Joe: Hahaha we do like our doughnuts. It’s weirdly considered a breakfast food here 😂
11/7/20 18:04 - Joe: Hahah spanish way of spelling it makes more sense.
11/7/20 18:47 - Lorena: Jaja vos desayunas Donuts y tortitas siempre?
11/7/20 18:48 - Lorena: En España cambian muchísimo las palabras, siempre hay crítica por eso jaja muy "spanglish"
11/7/20 19:03 - Joe: Haha noooo. Usually eggs and avocados or something like that.
11/7/20 19:04 - Joe: Doughnuts are too sweet for me to eat for breakfast most of the time. I was definitely eating a lot of pancakes when I was staying with my sister but haven’t had any since I came back to California
11/7/20 19:14 - Lorena: Ahhhh mejor jaja
11/7/20 19:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 19:27 - Joe: Hahaha I eat relatively healthy....for an American 😂
11/7/20 20:13 - Joe: I actually just watched a video recently about Americans weird sugary breakfasts. We eat super sweet and/or heavy breakfast compared to the rest of the world. The pictures of breakfast you send me always look super light and healthy compared to what is typical here
11/7/20 20:45 - Lorena: Jajaja si en Uruguay se come un poco mal también, bizcochos con café o mate .. pero yo estoy más acostumbrada a los desayunos de España, me gusta mucho más desayunar salado que dulce
11/7/20 20:47 - Lorena: Tostadas acompañadas con queso, aguacate, tomate o pavo.. te voy a hacer uno de esos desayunos algún día en la cama jaja como un rey
11/7/20 20:53 - Joe: Hahahah you’re the fucking best!
11/7/20 20:55 - Joe: I got to leave a few minutes early. Time for some food! I only had a coffee this morning.
11/7/20 21:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:02 - Lorena: ♥️
11/7/20 21:03 - Lorena: Sos buen cocinero? Yo solo soy buena para los desayunos 😂
11/7/20 21:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:09 - Joe: Haha I think I told you before. I’m good at following recipes 😂
11/7/20 21:09 - Joe: FUCK
11/7/20 21:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:15 - Lorena: Si es verdad, perdón! Jaja
11/7/20 21:15 - Lorena: Cifras mundiales
11/7/20 21:15 - Lorena: Jajaja este me encanta
11/7/20 21:18 - Joe: The number is getting big. I was looking at the way the 1918 spanish flu worked out. Took 2 to 3 years before the infection rate went way down. This could take a while
11/7/20 21:18 - Joe: So shitty haha
11/7/20 21:29 - Lorena: Si yo había escuchado que esto se alargaría dos años
11/7/20 21:29 - Lorena: Es tremendo...
11/7/20 21:34 - Joe: Damn that would suuuuck. It seems like a possibility though. I really hope this doesn’t last that long.
11/7/20 21:34 - Joe: 2 years of this madness is too much haha
11/7/20 21:36 - Lorena: No vamos a olvidar esto nunca si son dos años, de mierda
11/7/20 21:37 - Lorena: Esperemos que se pueda controlar, yo creo que tendrá que ser por un países.. algunos se irán a la mierda otros serán más inteligentes
11/7/20 21:37 - Lorena: Espero que los nuestros sean de los inteligentes jaja 🙏
11/7/20 21:39 - Joe: Haha for sure. But I’m already going to remember this forever
11/7/20 21:39 - Joe: Hopefully we aren’t in two countries that are going to go to shit haha
11/7/20 21:40 - Joe: Whoops haha I totally said the same thing before I read this. But we might be in two of the worst countries right now 😂
11/7/20 21:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:49 - Lorena: Jajaj si lo digo en alto me lo creo 🤫
11/7/20 21:52 - Joe: Haha I better be with you by November! I was hoping I’d get there before your birthday haha
11/7/20 21:53 - Joe: That passport must be coming any day now
11/7/20 21:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: Ohhh jaja mejor regalo de cumple
11/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: Jajaja
11/7/20 21:58 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 21:59 - Joe: I have no idea haha. They really didn’t give me a good timeframe. Just said it would be delayed. Usually it’s 6-8 weeks I believe but that’s without the delay 😬
11/7/20 22:00 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
11/7/20 22:00 - Lorena: Me encanta el acento de los niños sudamericanos
11/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: Son además más maduros al hablar normalmente
11/7/20 22:01 - Joe: I can’t wait to hear you say, “Este es el mejor cumpleaños de mi vida” ahahaha
11/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: Si pero eran 6 semanas cuando fuiste y eso fue cuando llegaste a Cali jajjaja
11/7/20 22:02 - Joe: Oh yeah that’s right.
11/7/20 22:02 - Joe: I probably did the appointment before camp started so that was at least 4 weeks ago
11/7/20 22:03 - Joe: Damn it must be coming soon
11/7/20 22:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/7/20 22:03 - Lorena: Si por eso.. debe ser en semanas
11/7/20 22:04 - Lorena: Por qué son tan lindos los perros? Jajaj
11/7/20 22:05 - Lorena: Si venís te lo diré
11/7/20 22:06 - Joe: Haha I don’t know but they’re great. I need a dog 😩
11/7/20 22:06 - Joe: When I come*
12/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:18 - Joe: Haha cute picture. Kenya loves to cuddle you so much. You look super pretty too. With a glow around your head haha
12/7/20 0:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:19 - Joe: Super cute haha 🥰
12/7/20 0:20 - Lorena: La luz de la ventana,la farola jaja
12/7/20 0:20 - Lorena: O el brazo jaja soy mala sacando selfies y Kenya además se relaja encima y pesa jaja no me deja moverme
12/7/20 0:22 - Joe: Well I really like that picture haha it’s a good one
12/7/20 0:22 - Joe: She doesn’t want you to go anywhere Haha
12/7/20 0:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:23 - Lorena: Gracias, para vos bombón!
12/7/20 0:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:25 - Joe: Haha she looks up at you when you say hola...like, “who, me?”
12/7/20 0:25 - Lorena: Jajaja si se pensaba que era para ella
12/7/20 0:25 - Joe: Dogs love humans too much haha the loyalty is great
12/7/20 0:26 - Lorena: Si boludo
12/7/20 0:26 - Lorena: Son demasiado leales
12/7/20 0:26 - Lorena: Los quiero tanto
12/7/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:26 - Joe: Hahah this one 😂
12/7/20 0:28 - Lorena: Pero me gusta así como Kenya pq se apoya encima mío es como un humano
12/7/20 0:28 - Lorena: Por ej con rogel no puedo hacer esto
12/7/20 0:31 - Joe: Haha yeah that’s true. She does look like a little human all cuddled up with you like that. With that arm over you and everything hahah
12/7/20 0:32 - Lorena: Jajajaj si si es que me encanta
12/7/20 0:33 - Lorena: Si ella estuviese contigo seguramente haría lo mismo
12/7/20 0:33 - Lorena: Reemplazaría a Socks
12/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: Ya paro con las fotos jajaja
12/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: 🤗
12/7/20 0:42 - Joe: She brings you in like quicksand haha
12/7/20 0:43 - Joe: Send as many as you want. I love to see them.
12/7/20 0:43 - Joe: It’s like a photo shoot haha
12/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: 😂
12/7/20 0:51 - Joe: Hahaha now I want to be Kenya like how you wanted to be socks the other day 😂
12/7/20 0:52 - Joe: Looks comfy
12/7/20 0:52 - Lorena: Jajajj
12/7/20 0:53 - Lorena: Imagínate nosotros viviendo con socks y Kenya juntos. serían perros geniales jajaj
12/7/20 1:06 - Joe: Hahah I would be so tempted to just cuddle with at least one of you all the time 😂
12/7/20 1:06 - Joe: Super unproductive hahaha but soooo great haha
12/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: Jajaja espero que me elijas antes que a socks
12/7/20 1:13 - Joe: Whenever that’s an option I choose you every time haha no doubt
12/7/20 1:13 - Lorena: Ups, mi hermano y su novia acaban de discutir, ella esta mal, se iba a ir en coche a su casa y finalmente llamó a mí madre y se queda en casa pero no duerme con el 😬
12/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: Todos juntos en una cama o sofá
12/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: https://www.facebook.com/econoofertasperu/videos/2582135188551565/
12/7/20 1:16 - Joe: Damn that sucks. Poor brother. It sucks that she tries to leave instead of working it out. Not a great sign haha
12/7/20 1:16 - Joe: 😂
12/7/20 1:16 - Lorena: Se fue por qué el la ignoró 🙈
12/7/20 1:17 - Joe: Yessss haha
12/7/20 1:17 - Joe: Hahaha 😆
12/7/20 1:18 - Joe: I mean sometimes people need time before they want to talk about something. But I don’t now the situation so I don’t want to speculate 😂
12/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Mi hermano está ahora trabajando 10hs de socorrista y el acaba cansado, ella es muy hipocondríaca con covid por su padre.. y además ella parece que es celíaca y Gastón supuestamente de vez en cuando le pregunta cómo está, pero no lo suficiente...
12/7/20 1:19 - Lorena: Jaja me encanta dando tu opinión si saber, ahí te lo conté igual jjj
12/7/20 1:20 - Joe: Aaah that’s a tough situation. Working hard, being tired, stress from COVID stuff. Not a great combination
12/7/20 1:20 - Lorena: Nada buena combinación
12/7/20 1:22 - Lorena: Me da pena pq está mal y no come por sus pruebas y estuvo llorando .. y Gastón está abajo en su habitación y no le dice nada 😤
12/7/20 1:22 - Joe: If we have a fight I’ll have to send you messages or write you a letter cause I won’t know how to express myself well enough haha shit
12/7/20 1:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 1:24 - Joe: Yeah i guess it sounds like Gastón could do a little more. Or at least seem more concerned? But I’m sure he is tired as well which makes it hard
12/7/20 1:25 - Lorena: Jaja no imagino una pelea con vos, aunque discutir no es malo ... Pero si nos pasa en algún momento, sé que lo hablamos y lo resolvemos
12/7/20 1:26 - Lorena: Bueno me da esa sensación, además tenés bastante empatía eso es genial de vos siempre te preocupas, entonces te devuelvo eso de la misma manera
12/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: El esta cansado de trabajar y dice que no quiere aguantar esas tonterias. Que tiene que parar de ser tan hipocondríaca y estar más alegre .. básicamente esa fue su respuesta cuando mi madre y yo fuimos a hablar con el
12/7/20 1:28 - Joe: I think we would be able to resolve most things for sure haha
12/7/20 1:29 - Joe: 😬😬 yeaah that's tough. Sounds like a response that someone with a lot of stress would give
12/7/20 1:30 - Lorena: Eso es bueno querido desconocido jjjj
12/7/20 1:30 - Joe: Haha thanks. Yeah i've noticed you care quite a bit, especially for having never met me 😂
12/7/20 1:56 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 2:12 - Joe: Hahah
12/7/20 2:12 - Joe: i almost fell asleep 😂 I need to take a nap
12/7/20 7:45 - Lorena: Yo me quedé dormida, de hecho no me acuerdo de haber enviado ese gif jaja
12/7/20 8:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:19 - Joe: Hahah Kenya is such a sleepy dog. I swear most of the videos you send with Kenya are of her cuddling and sleeping on you 😂
12/7/20 8:20 - Joe: I ended up taking that nap. Now I feel like that meme of the kangaroo I sent you haha. It was supposed to be a 30 minute nap and I slept for 5 hours haha
12/7/20 8:22 - Lorena: Jajaja si, luego otra gran parte salimos a pasear.. pero ella ahí se dedica a correr
12/7/20 8:23 - Lorena: Nooooo
12/7/20 8:23 - Lorena: Jajaja q bruto
12/7/20 8:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:26 - Joe: Hahah now I don’t know what to do. I’m not very tired but i also am supposed to wake up early. I guess I’ll try to go back to sleep in an hour or two.
12/7/20 8:26 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:27 - Lorena: Jaja es que 5 horas de siesta!!!
12/7/20 8:29 - Lorena: Yo creo que no dormí tanto, las mías son microsiestas de 15-20min, 1hr cuando tengo tiempo
12/7/20 8:33 - Joe: Microsiestas hahaha
12/7/20 8:34 - Joe: I didn’t want to sleep for so long! Haha it was an accident.
12/7/20 8:34 - Joe: I had just eaten a bunch of food and it was super hot. I got so sleepy haha. Oh well it happens 🤷‍♂️
12/7/20 8:43 - Lorena: Jajaj
12/7/20 8:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 8:50 - Joe: Hahah that’s what I felt like.
12/7/20 8:51 - Joe: I actually slept on the floor cause it was too hot in my bed. I didn’t think I’d be asleep for so long so sleeping on the floor seemed like a good idea.
12/7/20 8:56 - Lorena: Jajajaja
12/7/20 8:57 - Lorena: En el suelo sin nada o con alguna esterilla?
12/7/20 8:59 - Joe: The floor was carpet but I was laying on a towel. Pretty comfortable actually
12/7/20 8:59 - Joe: Maybe a little too comfortable apparently 😆
12/7/20 9:09 - Lorena: 🤭😂 me hubiese gustado pasar por ahí y verte ahí en el suelo jaja
12/7/20 9:10 - Lorena: Es verdad ahí tienen moqueta, acá no se usa casi.. las casas tienen pequeñas alfombras pero moqueta nadie
12/7/20 9:13 - Joe: Interesting. I didn’t realize having a lot of carpet is kind of an American thing. Americans must be a strange bunch to the rest of the world haha
12/7/20 9:21 - Lorena: Jajaja
12/7/20 9:24 - Lorena: Se puede usar en alguna zona muy fría como países escandinavos, pero eso es común de ustedes. A mí me encanta ir descalza, sería genial pisar en moqueta jj .. pero no me imagino, no poder barrer bien o limpiar el suelo con fregona con olor a fregasuelos
12/7/20 9:31 - Joe: Now i am just wondering what other things seem common to me but are actually not super common haha. Like how we have mostly automatic gears in our cars. I didn’t realize automatics are less common in other places
12/7/20 9:33 - Joe: We’re actually taking out a lot of the carpet and putting in hardwood floors. Carpet is nice but it is difficult to keep it looking nice for years
12/7/20 9:34 - Lorena: Joe en su burbuja jajaja
12/7/20 9:35 - Lorena: Me autorizas a que te envié fotos? Voy al campo con las perras
12/7/20 9:35 - Lorena: *Envie
12/7/20 9:35 - Lorena: No quiero despertarte si en algún momento te dormís jaja
12/7/20 9:36 - Joe: Send theeeeem
12/7/20 9:36 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:39 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:40 - Joe: Like a postcard haha. Pretty
12/7/20 9:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:44 - Lorena: Jajajajaj
12/7/20 9:44 - Lorena: La próxima la mando a Hércules
12/7/20 9:44 - Lorena: Turqouise? 🤭🤔
12/7/20 9:45 - Joe: Wait what? Did I tell you what street live on? Hahaha
12/7/20 9:46 - Joe: *Turquoise
12/7/20 9:46 - Lorena: Eso
12/7/20 9:47 - Lorena: Jajaj pq soy observadora
12/7/20 9:48 - Lorena: Destinatario: Joseph Villavicencio
12/7/20 9:48 - Lorena: Jajaja lo vi en los papeles del pasaporte
12/7/20 9:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:48 - Lorena: Hace cuánto no recibis una carta?
12/7/20 9:49 - Lorena: Jajajaj
12/7/20 9:49 - Joe: Hahaha just kidding. That’s funny though. I was trying to think of when I told you. That makes sense haha
12/7/20 9:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:52 - Lorena: Jajjaja me imagino tu cara, esta piba es una psicópata como sabe mi dirección
12/7/20 9:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:53 - Lorena: No me lo digas dos veces que al final te mando una jajaj a
12/7/20 9:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 9:58 - Joe: Hahaha
12/7/20 9:58 - Joe: I definitely wouldn’t mind receiving something from youuu
12/7/20 10:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 10:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 10:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

12/7/20 17:38 - Joe: The warmup skating didn’t go well haha I suck today. I should’ve ate breakfast but I woke up kind of late
12/7/20 17:44 - Joe: I need a new audiobook or something to pass the time today
12/7/20 17:44 - Lorena: Ay te estoy pasando un vídeo pero no se carga
12/7/20 17:46 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/7/20 17:48 - Lorena: No tengo puta cobertura en esta montaña

12/7/20 23:56 - Joe: This is a different car haha we got to drive the other one already but we didn’t get to do much drifting. It was already getting dark when we got to the spot that day we fixed it. Now he is trying to get this one ready for an event on Wednesday
13/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Ajjhh
13/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Ahhh
13/7/20 0:03 - Lorena: Jaja me pierdo con tantos coches
13/7/20 0:06 - Joe: He has too many cars haha and they all need work 😂
13/7/20 0:06 - Joe: I always tell him that he should just have 1 nice car instead of 3 or 4 shitty ones
13/7/20 0:06 - Joe: But he likes cars. Especially the older ones.
13/7/20 0:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
13/7/20 0:12 - Joe: Super random....some lady came by the skatepark with a hella big dog. A Tibetan mastiff. She said it didn’t like Chinese people. I thought that was weird haha. But it was so fluffy. I wish I would’ve taken a picture
13/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Jaja tiene sentido!
13/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Que te pasó en el pie Homeless?
13/7/20 0:17 - Joe: Homeless 😂
13/7/20 0:17 - Joe: Shit
13/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: Por qué dijo eso esa zorra? Kyle es asiático no? Por el o por otro motivo?
13/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: 💅
13/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: Jajajaj
13/7/20 0:18 - Joe: My board hit my leg super hard. I didn’t think it was very bad but it’s been a few hours and it still hurts so i decided to ice it
13/7/20 0:19 - Lorena: Ohhh pobrecito
13/7/20 0:21 - Joe: Well she explained that he dog doesn’t like people that are afraid of it.
13/7/20 0:22 - Joe: I asked one of my friends and he said that dog is like a guard dog in China often. It’s seen as an aggressive breed to many, like how Americans see pit bulls as aggressive.
13/7/20 0:23 - Joe: But, she hella pulled the dog away when my Asian homie came up even though he wasn’t afraid of the dog haha so that made me question that lady and how she is training the dog
13/7/20 0:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
13/7/20 0:25 - Lorena: Que zorra
13/7/20 0:26 - Joe: Woooah! It wasn’t as big as that huge one but it was just as fluffy looking
13/7/20 0:26 - Joe: Actually it was probably pretty close in size to that dog. Just a tiny bit smaller
13/7/20 0:27 - Lorena: Que lindo poder abrazarlo jaja
13/7/20 0:29 - Joe: He had a big giant eye booger hahah but he was cool. The owner was surprised he liked me and had to take a picture for the trainer 😂
13/7/20 7:57 - Lorena: Perdón me quedé súper dormida, con la luz encendida y sin la alarma puesta 🙈. Menos mal que me desperté sola con la luz natural, porque tengo que ir a trabajar ... grrr estoy re cansada 😫

14/7/20 0:34 - Joe: Haha what are the horrible slips? I feel like this was another test hahahah
14/7/20 0:35 - Joe: I just need underwear that keep my balls safe and are comfortable to move around in. I don’t put too much thought into it when I buy them haha
14/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Jajajaj
14/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: Los slip feos, son como de niño/viejo.. pero entiendo que pueden ser más cómodos jaja igual es lo de menos me gustó igual quería saber
14/7/20 0:38 - Lorena: Y vos qué te gusta? De físico o ropa interior?
14/7/20 0:38 - Lorena: Quiero saberlo
14/7/20 0:42 - Joe: 🤔 I mean, I like all the things you’ve been wearing in the videos you send so far. Very sexy. I guess as long as you aren’t wearing grandma underwear it’s all good haha.
14/7/20 0:48 - Lorena: Mmm jaja okey, conformista jaja
14/7/20 0:49 - Joe: Hahaha what?? Sorry I don’t have a strong opinion on underwear either way 😂
14/7/20 0:50 - Joe: You can even wear grandma underwear if you want. I won’t judge you for it haha
14/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: Jaja igual sonó raro.. dije conformista pero no a mal
14/7/20 0:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

14/7/20 1:16 - Lorena: Si decidia quedarme despierta es pq no tenía horarios antes, ahora obviamente puedo quedarme un rato..pero está haría no es tan tarde.. mucha veces con las chicas me quedo hasta  esta hora
14/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Lo que te quería decir era una forma de hablar, no quiero dormirme por que te veo y no es "justo" estar dormida jaja, pero no tenés que sentirte mal por eso.. era como algo bonito
14/7/20 1:20 - Joe: Haha alright for sure. Thanks. Yeah sometimes I forget that it’s not a 12 hour difference anymore. 1am not 4am haha. It’s not THAT late.

14/7/20 16:03 - Lorena: eyy, yo creo que esos niños la final se divertirán y se llevarán bien. Jaja qué tipo de maldad tienen?
14/7/20 16:03 - Lorena: Si? Jaja que pasaba en el sueño??
14/7/20 16:06 - Joe: They’re just jerks that don’t listen haha
14/7/20 16:07 - Joe: Hahahah it was a sexy dream 🙊🙈
14/7/20 16:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

14/7/20 19:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/7/20 20:07 - Lorena: Jajajaja
14/7/20 21:19 - Joe: I am so not looking forward to these lessons haha. I hope these kids are better when it’s just me and them compared to how they behave at camp
14/7/20 22:17 - Lorena: Jajaja estas de "niñero" de skate
14/7/20 22:17 - Lorena: Cuáles son los dos niños?
14/7/20 22:48 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/7/20 22:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
14/7/20 22:51 - Lorena: Jajaj que le pasa al niño, esta enojado?
14/7/20 22:52 - Lorena: 2 y 5 seg jaja muy rápido
14/7/20 23:10 - Joe: Hahah yeah short videos. The kid just has an attitude all the time. He isn’t even mad haha. Whatever. $140 for 2 hours with these kids. Could be worse
14/7/20 23:43 - Lorena: Jajak esta bien pagado, yo los aguantaría también
14/7/20 23:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
14/7/20 23:43 - Lorena: Pero parece un amargado el niño
14/7/20 23:44 - Lorena: Jajaj que no se siente, que patine mucho hasta cansarse
15/7/20 0:06 - Joe: Yeah I think it was worth it haha not bad for a days work
15/7/20 0:07 - Joe: He is haha and he is very against trying new tricks if he can’t do it first try
15/7/20 0:08 - Joe: I’m finally free but now I have to sit in traffic 😡
15/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: 😬😬😬
15/7/20 0:09 - Lorena: Bueno debe querer llamar la atención, ya se le pasará...
15/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: Por cierto supiste algo más de el chico de codificación?
15/7/20 0:11 - Lorena: Upss espero que no sea mucho
15/7/20 0:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 0:11 - Joe: Yeah it’s not a big deal. Only 2 hours haha I can take it
15/7/20 0:12 - Joe: Pfff nooo
15/7/20 0:12 - Lorena: Jjjj 🙈
15/7/20 0:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 0:15 - Lorena: Grrr 🙃
15/7/20 0:16 - Joe: This is where I want to be hahah
15/7/20 0:20 - Lorena: Dentro de poquito llegas a tu casa y podés descansar ☺️

15/7/20 0:25 - Lorena: Ahh bueno, mejor.. ahí también te relajas!

15/7/20 3:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 3:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 5:26 - Lorena: Que ojos más celestes!!
15/7/20 5:26 - Lorena: Ohhh que lindo este bebé!! 😍
15/7/20 5:33 - Joe: Super cute. I’m having too much fun with the baby haha. I want to kidnap her 😂
15/7/20 5:35 - Lorena: Ah es una bebé, hacete algún video con ella
15/7/20 5:36 - Lorena: Es muy linda eh, mira que cachetes.. es para comérsela!!!
15/7/20 5:41 - Joe: Someone stole her from me 😞
15/7/20 7:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 7:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 7:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 7:50 - Lorena: Buen momento! Fuego con amigos por la noche ✨
15/7/20 7:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 8:20 - Joe: Oh yeah it was great. I’m leaving now. I have to get home and go to sleep. I have work tomorrow morning haha
15/7/20 8:43 - Joe: I made it home safe haha I’m hella tired and have to wake up early so I’m going to sleep now 😴 have a good day! I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Buenas noches
15/7/20 8:47 - Lorena: Estaba desayunando y ya vistiendome para el trabajo que vienen los jefe, que pereza jaja
15/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Gracias, descansa, muuuak 😘
15/7/20 8:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:11 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:23 - Lorena: Good morning!!
15/7/20 16:28 - Joe: I am so tired!
15/7/20 16:28 - Joe: I’m making extra strong coffee right now. Are you working?
15/7/20 16:30 - Lorena: Jaja sí me imagino, de la fogata jjj todo el día
15/7/20 16:30 - Lorena: No yo estoy en casaa, salí a las 3
15/7/20 16:31 - Lorena: 😀
15/7/20 16:32 - Joe: Ah ok. Dude I was having way too much fun playing with my friends kid haha. And then my other friend brought his kids too.
15/7/20 16:33 - Joe: This is probably weird for me to say but I was hella wanting my own little baby yesterday 😂
15/7/20 16:34 - Lorena: Jajajaja
15/7/20 16:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:35 - Lorena: JajajA yo te puedo dar uno! 😂
15/7/20 16:35 - Joe: 😂 😂
15/7/20 16:35 - Lorena: Esa niña que me mostraste en el video era para comérsela!!
15/7/20 16:36 - Lorena: Te salió el instinto paternal
15/7/20 16:36 - Lorena: Me hubiese gustado presenciar eso jajaj
15/7/20 16:36 - Joe: 🙊hahahah
15/7/20 16:37 - Joe: Ugh she is soooo cute! I was pushing her on the swing for hella long having way too much fun haha
15/7/20 16:38 - Joe: The funny thing is, my friends that have kids are the super irresponsible friends haha. The friends that we guessed would’ve been the last to have kids had kids first haha
15/7/20 16:39 - Joe: I don’t want to take care of everyone else’s kids haha I want to make my own kids cool
15/7/20 16:39 - Lorena: Oooiins que dulce
15/7/20 16:40 - Lorena: Si suele pasar, entre alguna de mis amigas también jaja
15/7/20 16:41 - Lorena: tus amigos tendrán ternura al verte jugar tanto con sus hijos jaja
15/7/20 16:43 - Lorena: Ohh jaja no es muy normal escuchar eso en chicos de mi edad
15/7/20 16:43 - Joe: I guess it makes sense. They had the kids on accident which matches their irresponsible personalities hahaa
15/7/20 16:44 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:46 - Joe: Haha yeah I thought it would be weird to tell you but that’s what I’ve been feeling lately. Probably from just being around kids so much and trying to help them learn.
15/7/20 16:47 - Lorena: 💚
15/7/20 16:47 - Joe: I don’t know. Am I supposed to want other things at this age? I feel like I want to be a dad 😂
15/7/20 16:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 16:50 - Lorena: Jajaja si no sé, no es muy normal escucharlo con esta edad.. también igual es porque estoy acostumbrada que en España se tienen los hijos super tarde
15/7/20 16:51 - Lorena: Creo que en USA es más común hijos más jóvenes, casarse, etc
15/7/20 16:52 - Lorena: Tendrías hijos igual o adoptarias como padre soltero?
15/7/20 16:52 - Joe: Haha that makes sense. What would you say is a typical age to have kids in Spain?
15/7/20 16:53 - Lorena: Mmm depende.. igual 35..38.. tarde jajaja
15/7/20 16:54 - Lorena: En Uruguay suele ser antes
15/7/20 16:54 - Joe: Hmmm I don’t know if I would adopt. Maybe if that was my only option haha I wouldn’t be totally against it. If I knew I’d never have a kid I’d probably adopt at that point
15/7/20 16:55 - Joe: Damn that’s pretty late haha. Everyone in Spain has old ass parents 😆
15/7/20 16:55 - Lorena: Jaja te gustaría que sea tuyo entonces? Más que adoptado no?
15/7/20 16:56 - Joe: Haha yeah it would be my preference to have my own. Little mini me hahaha
15/7/20 16:56 - Lorena: Hay gente joven también que los tiene, pero por accidente, porque lleva mucho con pareja o cosas así
15/7/20 16:56 - Lorena: Jjjj Mini Joe 😍
15/7/20 16:57 - Joe: My friend’s son looks hella like me. Super similar hair and everything. Seeing that little dude hella makes me want my own little dude haha
15/7/20 16:58 - Lorena: Jajaj cuál? No lo vi a ese
15/7/20 17:00 - Joe: They came after it got dark. I sent a Instagram post with his kids
15/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: Jajaj un mini rulitos
15/7/20 17:03 - Joe: I want a little one 😩
15/7/20 17:04 - Joe: Ok ok I’m sorry enough of that. I’ll get over it hahaha. Alright babe I have to go to work now. I hope you have a wonderful day. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
15/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
15/7/20 17:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 17:05 - Joe: Fuck. Too cute haha
15/7/20 17:05 - Joe: 😂
15/7/20 17:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 17:08 - Joe: 😩
15/7/20 17:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 17:09 - Lorena: okey papiiii, que ese café te haga efecto, que tengas un buen día de trabajo, yo me voy a dormir una microsiesta.Muuak 😘
15/7/20 20:54 - Lorena: Cómo vasss?
15/7/20 21:02 - Joe: It’s going well. Just waiting for the last 2 kids to get picked up and I can get some lunch before starting the private lesson
15/7/20 21:07 - Lorena: Genial!
15/7/20 21:15 - Joe: The private lesson wasn’t actually that bad. The kids were better behaved compared to when they were at camp. I think it’s because the park had a lot of adults skating so they weren’t as comfortable.
15/7/20 21:18 - Lorena: Mmm
15/7/20 21:18 - Lorena: Aún no la empezaste la clase privada
15/7/20 21:18 - Lorena: O si?
15/7/20 21:20 - Lorena: Sea como sea, me alegro que hayas podido ver pq se sienten incómodos profe ☺️
15/7/20 21:21 - Joe: The private lesson for today starts at 1. Yesterday’s lesson went well
15/7/20 21:22 - Lorena: 👌
15/7/20 21:23 - Joe: Yeah it’s not so bad. We’ll see how many weeks I continue doing these lessons for. I have some other people trying to get lessons too. Going to start a bidding war haha
15/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 21:26 - Joe: Actually I’ve been thinking I need to increase my prices for private lessons. I have a friend that does them and he charges almost twice what I charge haha
15/7/20 21:27 - Lorena: Cuánto cobrabas? 30-40 dol la hora, o así no?
15/7/20 21:30 - Joe: Yeah I charge about that much. $30-40 per hour. But my friend charges $60+ per hour and has no trouble getting lessons
15/7/20 21:31 - Lorena: Wow! 60 dol la hora
15/7/20 21:32 - Lorena: Pero a niños también? El es muy muy bueno?
15/7/20 21:32 - Lorena: Me refiero, que diferencia tanto el precio?
15/7/20 21:33 - Joe: Yeah he also teaches children. He is probably about the same level of skating as me.
15/7/20 21:33 - Joe: Nothing. He just asked for that much. Parents have a lot of money around here haha
15/7/20 21:33 - Joe: Have you seen Orange Is The New Black on Netflix?
15/7/20 21:34 - Lorena: Vaya pijos que son en bay area jaja
15/7/20 21:34 - Lorena: Pues ya sabes bombón, a subir esa tarifa!!!
15/7/20 21:34 - Joe: One of the kids that I’m giving private lessons to said his mom wrote the book and sold it to Netflix. So I’m assuming his mom is the main character and also very rich hahaa
15/7/20 21:35 - Lorena: Siii la vi jajaj
15/7/20 21:35 - Lorena: Aunque la última temporada ya no, era muy repetitivo
15/7/20 21:35 - Joe: Oh yeah for sure haha. I’m getting $70 hour but I have to watch 2 kids haha. That should be the price for just 1
15/7/20 21:36 - Lorena: Bueno.. también podés hacer precio cuando van 2
15/7/20 21:37 - Lorena: Jaja sí es así, es bastante rica si..
15/7/20 21:37 - Lorena: Podés cobrar 60 dol la hora y 50dol si van dos
15/7/20 21:40 - Lorena: O 70 y 60
15/7/20 21:41 - Joe: I think 60 and 50 for two is probably reasonable.
15/7/20 21:41 - Lorena: Si la gente ahí tiene dinero.. aprovecha.. pensarán que cuanto más caro es mejor
15/7/20 21:41 - Lorena: Si.. más que nada pq si no es mucha diferencia de tus 30-49 a más de 60
15/7/20 21:42 - Lorena: Así te aseguras
15/7/20 21:42 - Joe: That’s probably true. I know one guy that would charge $100 per hour. He was really good instructor but very expensive
15/7/20 21:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
15/7/20 21:43 - Lorena: Uf es demasiado 100!!
15/7/20 21:44 - Lorena: Y menos para niños que tampoco hacen demasiado.. si fuese algo más técnico.. está más justificado, no? Bueno.. no sé.. jaja
15/7/20 21:47 - Joe: I guess it depends on the goal. If the parents basically want a babysitter $100 is too much. But if they’re actually trying to get their kid to the next level and progress it’s not super unreasonable. It doesn’t take a crazy amount of hours to get a lot of improvement so it seems worth it.
15/7/20 21:48 - Joe: The parents of these kids seem like they want a babysitter and it’s just a bonus that I can skate with the kids while doing it haha.
16/7/20 0:15 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/7/20 0:16 - Lorena: Telepatía
16/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/7/20 0:18 - Joe: Yessss it finally passed!!! Now for traffic haha
16/7/20 0:18 - Joe: ❤️
16/7/20 0:23 - Lorena: 🤟
16/7/20 0:24 - Lorena: Es puro amor..
16/7/20 5:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/7/20 10:20 - Lorena: Es bonito ese skatepark con las montañas detrás y justo los pájaros pasan en el video jj
16/7/20 15:43 - Joe: Buenos días!
16/7/20 15:44 - Joe: The mountains are such a constant feature in the background here that I sometimes don’t even notice them anymore. But when I go somewhere without mountains i definitely notice they’re missing haha
16/7/20 19:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
16/7/20 20:28 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
16/7/20 20:28 - Lorena: Que lindos
16/7/20 20:29 - Lorena: El niño lo dice super bien! 🤟
16/7/20 20:31 - Lorena: me gusta este vídeo! Jajaj aj
16/7/20 20:41 - Joe: We’re learning Spanish together hahaha
16/7/20 20:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
16/7/20 20:43 - Lorena: Bueno ella también es simpática jjj
16/7/20 20:43 - Lorena: Me gustaría ver cómo les enseñaste a decir ronronear jajajja
16/7/20 21:16 - Joe: Hahaha we didn’t skate for the whole last hour. Just learned Spanish 😂
16/7/20 21:17 - Joe: Yeah those two kids are not so bad.
16/7/20 21:18 - Joe: Time for a short break before the lessons start. I’m getting tired.

17/7/20 7:25 - Joe: Yeah you should definitely do that some day haha. I love going out when there is very few people out. It’s especially interesting in bigger cities that you usually see very full. Completely different vibe haha
17/7/20 7:27 - Lorena: Síii, otra energía.. además veo cosas que normalmente no veo jajaja
17/7/20 7:30 - Lorena: Canarias

17/7/20 7:30 - Joe: Haha that’s also true. Well I hope you have a good day at work. You’ll probably be getting off around the time I wake up 🙄
17/7/20 7:31 - Joe: hahaha Is this where we meet?
17/7/20 7:31 - Lorena: Si voy de camino aún, hoy salgo a las 13:00 hs
17/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: Vos estarás re dormido jaja
17/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: Es donde iremos si venís y donde yo creo que viviré una temporada en algún momento jajaja
17/7/20 7:34 - Joe: Sounds like a plan haha I’d be super stoked to get back to island life haha 🌴
17/7/20 7:36 - Joe: It would be great if my passport would show up. And if they would open up travel 😑

I’m ready to go!
17/7/20 7:38 - Lorena: Sii ademas mucha gente ahí habla en inglés no tendrías problema jaja
17/7/20 7:39 - Lorena: Cómo está la cosa por ahí? Me habías dicho que habían cerrado varios establecimientos..
17/7/20 7:43 - Joe: A lot of people knowing English would be great. I still need to know my spanish for you though haha most important.
17/7/20 7:44 - Joe: Oh yeah things are closing again in some states. Cases are going up. They’re considering whether or not to open schools after summer.
17/7/20 7:45 - Joe: I think in the city I work they decided they’ll do 8 weeks of online classes at least to start the school year.
17/7/20 7:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 7:52 - Lorena: Ufff acá también! Hay zonas en otras comunidades autónomas que cerraron por nuevos casos. Las clases acá empiezan en septiembre y las están preparando para que sean online también
17/7/20 7:53 - Lorena: Que difícil es volver al mundo de antes 🙃
17/7/20 7:54 - Joe: Shiiiiit
17/7/20 7:56 - Joe: For real! Fuck. This is some ridiculous shit. If I was just “allowed” to go, I’d be there so soon.
17/7/20 7:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 7:57 - Lorena: Jajajaja Joe impaciente
17/7/20 7:57 - Joe: I thought you’d be the impatient one 😂
17/7/20 7:57 - Joe: But it’s meee
17/7/20 7:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 7:58 - Lorena: Yo estoy todavía esperando jaja a pesar de que las fronteras cierren
17/7/20 8:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 8:00 - Joe: Hahahaha
17/7/20 8:01 - Joe: I appreciate it. I’m still going. I still tell people I’m trying to get to Spain when they ask when I’m going back to Hawaii haha
17/7/20 8:01 - Lorena: Jajja no no Hawaii no
17/7/20 8:01 - Lorena: Ademasss ya lo conoces
17/7/20 8:02 - Lorena: España aún no, además podés tener muy buena compañía (yo) y aprender un idioma jajaja
17/7/20 8:02 - Joe: I know you said you won’t stop talking to me...but if for some reason this went on for years and you actually did stop talking to me, I’d still go to Spain the first chance I get hahaa. I can’t not go
17/7/20 8:03 - Lorena: Years????????
17/7/20 8:03 - Joe: No I’m not going back to Hawaii. I’m going to you haha.
17/7/20 8:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 8:03 - Joe: It better not be years. It was an extreme hypothetical situation haha
17/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Muy extrema
17/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Jajaj exagerado!!!!
17/7/20 8:04 - Joe: Hahah I’m just saying. I’m going to Spain no matter what. I need to go at this point 😆
17/7/20 8:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 8:06 - Lorena: Antes que sean años
17/7/20 8:06 - Lorena: Pido yo la visa y voy a verte
17/7/20 8:06 - Joe: Haha well besides seeing you, which is what I really want...I’ve also grown super fond of the idea of going to a country and learning more spanish. But like you said, it would be good for me to learn with you 😊
17/7/20 8:06 - Lorena: Me planto ahí en California jajaj
17/7/20 8:08 - Joe: Yesss haha you should definitely do that. We’ll see who can get to the other fastest. Though I’m pretty sure I’ll win this race haha
17/7/20 8:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 8:09 - Lorena: Jajaja si la ganas vos creo
17/7/20 8:09 - Lorena: Veremos a ver qué pasa
17/7/20 8:10 - Lorena: Mientras tanto habrá que sacar huequitos para hablar y que se haga más ameno
17/7/20 8:16 - Joe: I’ll try to keep things exciting for you hahah
17/7/20 8:17 - Joe: What is “huequitos” I know it’s the diminutive of something but 🤷‍♂️
17/7/20 8:24 - Joe: Alright you tell me what huequitos is when you can. I’m going to fall asleep any second haha have a great day, I’ll talk to you soon! Buenas noches 😘
17/7/20 13:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 13:22 - Lorena: Perdona que no te respondí estaba justo hablando con unas compañeras
17/7/20 13:23 - Lorena: Jijiji huequitos es un diminutivo. Correcto!
17/7/20 13:24 - Lorena: Hueco .. sería como una manera de decir a tener tiempo.. "sacar un hueco".. sacar un momento..un tiempo... Etc
17/7/20 13:25 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 13:28 - Lorena: Hueco de pozo, hueco de donut, hueco.. etc jjjj
17/7/20 15:36 - Joe: Niiice. But do you wish to start early too haha?
17/7/20 15:37 - Joe: All gooood. I went to sleep soon after messaging you
17/7/20 15:38 - Joe: Hahah ok I understand hueco now 😂 thank you. I have to get up and take a shower now.
17/7/20 16:14 - Lorena: Holi, estaba durmiendo una siiesstaaa jaja 😁

17/7/20 16:23 - Joe: Yeah I guess getting off early is pretty great. I used to always close when I was a pharmacy tech and sometimes I forget how much I hated it. I could never really do stuff after work cause I got off too late
17/7/20 16:30 - Lorena: Fuck the pharmacy, no more!!
17/7/20 16:35 - Joe: Hahah true! Never again 😂

17/7/20 16:59 - Lorena: Ay me suena a chino
17/7/20 16:59 - Lorena: Jajaj verlo así en esa medida
17/7/20 17:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 17:00 - Lorena: 10-12 grados
17/7/20 17:00 - Lorena: Jajaja
17/7/20 17:01 - Lorena: No te olvides del protector y gorro!
17/7/20 17:01 - Joe: Oh yeah haha Celsius not Fahrenheit
17/7/20 17:02 - Joe: Haha thank babe. I’m just about to leave now so I appreciate the reminder. I’ll put some on and grab a hat 😊
17/7/20 17:07 - Lorena: De nada bombón! Que tengas un buenn día! Un besito fuerte 💛 muakkk 😘

17/7/20 21:39 - Lorena: Hoy dormí dos siestas y en una de ellas, soñé con vos
17/7/20 21:41 - Joe: Hahaha this is what today felt like. Some of the kids are so much work 😂
17/7/20 21:42 - Joe: Especially if they decide you’re the “fun” counselor haha cause then they follow you around all day. They say my name so often hahaha it’s like my name being yelled is a constant background sound all day long haha
17/7/20 21:44 - Joe: Hahah sweet! I made it into your dream 😆 I hope it was a good dream haha
17/7/20 21:45 - Lorena: 😂😂😂😂
17/7/20 21:45 - Lorena: Me parece que el instinto paternal se te esta yendo
17/7/20 21:46 - Joe: Hahah I just want my own kid to annoy me. Not like 10 kids that aren’t mine all at once 😂
17/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: Si no me acuerdo mucho, solo que estábamos en un sitio pero no sé dónde era, estábamos prestando atención a algo que nos estaban explicando, pero nos estábamos haciendo caricias en la mano sin que se den cuenta, solo recuerdo eso, jajaja pero era genial,tocar algo real jaja ...
17/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: Suena tan cursi cuando lo digo jaja
17/7/20 21:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 21:48 - Lorena: Jajaja 😅 mi sueño..
17/7/20 21:49 - Joe: Haha sounds like a great dream to me!
17/7/20 21:50 - Joe: I wouldn’t mind some of this right now. I need to touch you 😂 I feel like I haven’t touched another human in so long haha
17/7/20 21:51 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 23:35 - Lorena: Eyy estaba cenando con las chicas
17/7/20 23:37 - Lorena: Para mí fue super bueno, es como que ya no estaba inquieta, ya estabas ahí tocándome la mano jajaj 🤷
17/7/20 23:38 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
17/7/20 23:39 - Lorena: Que suerte la que pueda tocarte ahora!!
17/7/20 23:45 - Joe: Aaaah I need another dream with you in it haha
17/7/20 23:45 - Joe: I’m over at Kyle’s now. I just got here not too long ago.
17/7/20 23:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
17/7/20 23:50 - Lorena: Jajajaja
17/7/20 23:50 - Lorena: Socks te ignora
17/7/20 23:51 - Lorena: 🙊😅
17/7/20 23:52 - Joe: She doesn’t love me anymore haha what a bummer
17/7/20 23:53 - Lorena: Hoy hice 3D con Sandri cuando nos levantamos de la siesta! Al principio fue súper frustrante, no salía lo que queríamos hacer, hoy estuve yo con el ordenador, y no me levanté de la silla hasta que salió lo que necesitábamos!
17/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Sandra empezó a comer cacahuetes compulsivamente jajaja pero finalmente logramos lo que queríamos, me encanta cuando esto pasa.. dimos un montón de vueltas, con lo que aprendimos y cada una ponía su manera de hacerlo.. muchas veces no funcionaba jaja
17/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Seguro que si, debe tener calor. Te protege estando cerca en tus pies jjj
18/7/20 0:02 - Joe: Damn learning the 3D stuff with someone sounds way better than learning alone. I wish I had a friend to learn how to code with.  It would’ve helped a lot.
18/7/20 0:02 - Joe: That’s really good though. I’m glad you stuck it out until you got it done haha
18/7/20 0:02 - Joe: Yeah I’ll just pretend she is protecting me, not ignoring me 😂
18/7/20 0:05 - Lorena: Jajaja si es genial, nos entró un ataque de risa al final .. además habíamos tomado el tinto de verano y yo ya me estaba quedando ciega, Sandra se empezó a reír pq yo no conseguía eliminar una geometría, se quedaba bloqueada jaja
18/7/20 0:06 - Lorena: Jajja ella mueve las orejitas sutilmente pero ni te mira 😂
18/7/20 0:07 - Lorena: Más video 👀

19/7/20 17:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 17:28 - Lorena: Necesitas un masaje de piernas ☝️
19/7/20 17:31 - Joe: Haha I need a full body massage. Too bad I don’t want a random person touching me 😆
19/7/20 17:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 17:32 - Lorena: Jajaja
19/7/20 17:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 17:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 17:44 - Joe: Hahaha yes I would accept a massage from you, and only you 😂
19/7/20 17:45 - Joe: I don’t know why but it just isn’t very relaxing having someone I don’t know touching all over me hahah
19/7/20 18:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 18:33 - Lorena: Mejor mejor jajajaja
19/7/20 18:34 - Lorena: Aunque me gustaría que puedas tener un masaje para que te alivie el dolor
19/7/20 18:34 - Lorena: Pero nada, descansas, te das una ducha y se te pasa jajaja
19/7/20 18:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 18:43 - Joe: Hahaha yeah I’ll skip the massage for now. I’m chillin with socks right now. I’ll try to relax as much as I can today. I need it
19/7/20 18:48 - Lorena: Jajaja socks te tiene atrapada entre sus patas
19/7/20 19:10 - Joe: Haha she is the best. My mom was looking for a dog the other day. I think she is going to get one soon haha
19/7/20 19:10 - Joe: Hopefully she gets a cool dog 🐕
19/7/20 19:15 - Lorena: Uhh que bueno eso!!! Jjjj
19/7/20 19:15 - Lorena: Por cierto, como está tu familia por Dookie?
19/7/20 19:15 - Lorena: Recuerdo que tú mamá estaba fuera de viaje
19/7/20 19:36 - Joe: My mom was looking for a dog to keep Elvis company haha
19/7/20 19:37 - Joe: But everyone is doing alright. We found out Dookie had a stomach cancer
19/7/20 19:37 - Lorena: Sería genial! Elvis con un perro 😊
19/7/20 19:37 - Lorena: 😔😔😔😔
19/7/20 19:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 19:39 - Joe: Hopefully Elvis won’t be too upset about it 😂
19/7/20 19:41 - Lorena: Siiii cuando me contaste la noticia, fui a nuestra conversación y vi este vídeo pero no sabía si reenviartelo. Me dio pena ...pobre Dookie ya estaba mal
19/7/20 19:42 - Lorena: Pero bueno, mejor así no sufre
19/7/20 20:04 - Joe: Yeah he wasn’t feeling well for a while. Bummer
19/7/20 20:05 - Joe: I almost fell asleep on the couch hahah I’m hella sleepy. I didn’t have any coffee today
19/7/20 22:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
19/7/20 22:22 - Lorena: 😱😱😱😱
19/7/20 22:22 - Lorena: Como suena jaja está re loco
19/7/20 22:22 - Lorena: Y sin el espejo retrovisor jajaja
19/7/20 22:22 - Lorena: Por un momento pensé que eras vos conduciendo y me asusté
19/7/20 22:36 - Joe: That car is a piece of shit but it can drift. It needs one more thing to be actually setup correctly though. It’s close
19/7/20 22:38 - Joe: I’ll make sure to send a video when it’s me driving next time haha
20/7/20 0:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Ey!! La estás haciendo vos?
20/7/20 0:35 - Lorena: Con 1000 palabras de nuestra conversación?
20/7/20 0:36 - Lorena: Quiero probarla jaja hagamos una apuesta a ver qué palabras salen más ahora jajaja
20/7/20 0:38 - Joe: Hahaha i'm just starting but yeah it's mostly so we can use it. I can add it to the list of projects i've done and it'll be good practice too. I'm interested to see what the top words are now. It's been a while since i did it the first time
20/7/20 0:39 - Lorena: Bien, buena idea! Para portfolio jjj
20/7/20 0:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 0:40 - Lorena: Wow cuando lo hiciste había pasado un mes, ahora ya llevamos más jaja saldrán nuevas palabras
20/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: Fuck, Miss, verte, bombón y babe jaja
20/7/20 0:41 - Lorena: Tendrías que hacer alguna opción que detecte frases cortas!!! Como de tres palabras o algo así
20/7/20 0:55 - Joe: Hahah i was going to ask you to help me out with it but i figured i should give it a try myself first 😂
20/7/20 0:56 - Joe: I was totally thinking the same thing! I'll give that a try once i have the basic features up and running
20/7/20 0:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 0:59 - Joe: You’ll click the button and then it’ll bring you to another page where you upload the file that weChat gives you when you export your chat. Then it should just provide a list of words and maybe some visualization or something.
20/7/20 1:03 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
20/7/20 1:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:09 - Lorena: jaja y si en algun momento pensamos subir un video, super simple.. con algo asi.. un buen titular.. seguro que ganaríamos dinero, podemos usarlo para tu viaje jaja
20/7/20 1:09 - Joe: Hahah top 1000 words is a popular thing to look up
20/7/20 1:09 - Lorena: en realidad podrias hablar vos, que sos el youtuber experimentado jajaja
20/7/20 1:09 - Joe: A couple good YouTube videos and the trip would be paid for 😂
20/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: nah, igual no tenemos por que salir.. por probar.. imaginate que se empieza a ver...!! y te pagan jajaj
20/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: en todo caso, pueod ayudar y repetir palabras en español, y vos en ingles
20/7/20 1:10 - Joe: Eh I was just doing it for fun. It actually helped me try more tricks while skating cause I had to make the videos interesting. Couldn’t just do the same tricks over and over like I usually do haha
20/7/20 1:10 - Lorena: pero un video muy breve, nada de dos horas como eso... que es un aburrimiento
20/7/20 1:11 - Joe: Hahah definitely. Short, simple and with all the information you need. Really quick haha
20/7/20 1:11 - Lorena: sisi, jaja no te estoy criticando!
20/7/20 1:12 - Joe: Haha for sure
20/7/20 1:12 - Lorena: y en el link podemos poner tu web, para que tenga visitas
20/7/20 1:12 - Lorena: y la gente se pueda descargar su propia conversación
20/7/20 1:14 - Joe: That would be great haha it's pretty hard to make a popular website. I just have to keep building things i find useful until i eventually make something other people can use too. It's all good practice and pretty fun too
20/7/20 1:14 - Joe: Except when i can't figure something out for days or weeks at a time. Then i get a little frustrated hahah
20/7/20 1:16 - Lorena: luego, podes sacar un video.. "como aumentar las visitas en una web gracias a youtube"
20/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: jajaja nah no sé, yo no tengo ni idea....! pero no perdemos nada, es gratis subir un video a youtube, si se empieza a visualizar igual podes pagar algo con ello, aunque sea las gestiones del pasaporte... pero creo que los videos e idiomas, son faciles de visualizacion
20/7/20 1:19 - Lorena: 1. un buen titulo . 2. Corto (unos 15 min max) 3. un diseño simple, como más serio, no tantos colores jaja
20/7/20 1:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:23 - Lorena: parame!!! jajaja
20/7/20 1:25 - Joe: Damn you're on a roll haha so many ideas. Yeah not much risk involved in uploading YouTube videos. You just have to be willing to possibly embarrass yourself a little bit. Not so bad haha
20/7/20 1:25 - Joe: Shit they got hella views! Very nice haha
20/7/20 1:26 - Joe: This website will be a little easier i think. Not much design to do. Just need a list that maybe has a download button and a graph or something like that
20/7/20 1:27 - Lorena: no no, yo no quiero pasar verguenza jajaja
20/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: vos, que hablas bien con las camaras podes dar la explicacion inicial, jajajaja y luego cada uno puede repetir en su idioma, pero breve y rápido... solo queremos dinero joe jajaja
20/7/20 1:28 - Joe: Hahah you'll just have to make the best video in the world first try...or don't make any videos at all 😂 i was always a little embarrassed to upload a YouTube video
20/7/20 1:29 - Joe: Hahaha ok sounds good
20/7/20 1:29 - Lorena: jajaja ahora mismo vos estas sieno como tus amigos hace unos años y yo como vos
20/7/20 1:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:30 - Lorena: jajajaja
20/7/20 1:30 - Lorena: podemos hacerlo sin salir nosotros
20/7/20 1:31 - Lorena: o... salir en pequeñito en un lateral jajaja solo repitiendo las palabras... en titulo puede agregar tambien algo como "voces de nativos" con alguna palabra clave como 1000 words o algo de eso
20/7/20 1:31 - Joe: I would love to make videos with you just for the memories alone. It would be great to look back on whatever time we end up getting to have together on video haha
20/7/20 1:32 - Joe: Boom...easy
20/7/20 1:32 - Lorena: yo no queiro hablar como la rubia esa estupida, ni nada...
20/7/20 1:32 - Joe: We can make the video on a video chat 😂
20/7/20 1:32 - Joe: Hahaha
20/7/20 1:32 - Lorena: jajaja no quiero que ninguno se convierta en un gif por favor jajajaja
20/7/20 1:33 - Joe: Mmmm you shouldn't have said that
20/7/20 1:33 - Joe: I'm making you into a gif somehow hahah
20/7/20 1:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:35 - Lorena: jajaja nooo
20/7/20 1:36 - Lorena: I know how to press your buttons
20/7/20 1:37 - Joe: Hahah naaah you don’t know how to push my buttons....I think 🤔
20/7/20 1:39 - Joe: How was your day though? Your week? Everything going well over there for you?
20/7/20 1:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:44 - Joe: Hahahahah
20/7/20 1:44 - Joe: I knew I shouldn’t have sent that
20/7/20 1:44 - Joe: Fuck
20/7/20 1:45 - Lorena: muy bien, hoy trabajé.. luego estuve tomando mates con un amigo, el patina y me dijo que hay sitios geniales para patinar.. en madrid hay algunos, y en Barcelona, muchos, que toda la ciudad es divertida para hacer cosas, le dije que me pase los nombres por escrito
20/7/20 1:46 - Lorena: no rulitos
20/7/20 1:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 1:47 - Joe: I combed the curls out. I swear my hair isn’t normally like that hahah
20/7/20 1:49 - Joe: Haha I’m looking forward to this list of spots. I already knew Barcelona was the better city for skating but you don’t live there sooo 🤷‍♂️
20/7/20 1:49 - Joe: Barcelona and San Francisco are like skateboard Meccas. Every skater wants to go to those cities at some point
20/7/20 1:51 - Lorena: jajaja no pierdas los rulos, hay en algunos videos que ya no los veo.. jaja, hay un video con los rulos y una gorra, que me pasaste en tu casa, que cuando lo veo en la galeria de fotos 🤤
20/7/20 1:52 - Lorena: ya... pero podemos ir .. necesito que Paz te diga algunos trucos para que pueda grabarte algo jaja
20/7/20 1:53 - Lorena: o podés ir sin mi también si te apetece, esta a solo 6 hrs de Madrid
20/7/20 1:54 - Joe: Hahha I’ll try to keep my curls nice for you 😂 😂
20/7/20 1:55 - Joe: Hah that would be siiick. I’m down for that haha
20/7/20 1:56 - Joe: What!? Haha no way! I’ll skip Barcelona completely instead of going without you
20/7/20 1:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:02 - Lorena: Down, Deprimido?
20/7/20 2:04 - Lorena: Jajaja si venís a España vamos a ir a BCN, eso te lo aseguro. No voy a dejar que vengas y no conozcas eso de skate ☝️
20/7/20 2:05 - Lorena: A alguien le gustó Notebookk jajaja cursy corny! 🤣
20/7/20 2:06 - Joe: Hahaha not depressed. Down for that, like uh, i would be willing to do that.
20/7/20 2:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:06 - Joe: 🙈🙈 SHiiiiiiiiiit hahahhaha
20/7/20 2:07 - Joe: That would be great. But i wouldn't hold it against you if we don't make it there. Just getting to you is such a challenge at this point i would be ecstatic to be in Madrid hahha
20/7/20 2:10 - Lorena: Vale te hago bromas, jajaj pero no dejes de decírmelo eh
20/7/20 2:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:12 - Lorena: Además tengo ganas de conocer mejor Barcelona, así que los dos podemos hacerlo y estaré encantada de que puedas ver sitios de skate, alguno de tus amigos estuvieron acá?
20/7/20 2:13 - Joe: I've had friends that have visited Barcelona but i don't think i know anyone that is living there now. But that sounds great. Hopefully we can make that trip happen and do some exploring together
20/7/20 2:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:15 - Joe: Hahahah 😂 😂 yes please hah
20/7/20 2:17 - Joe: I think i'm going to take a break from coding and watch some Mr Bean now hahah
20/7/20 2:17 - Lorena: Jajajaja
20/7/20 2:18 - Lorena: Seguro que alguna risa te consigue sacar
20/7/20 2:18 - Lorena: Seguramente veas un capitulo y salga algún gif de los que nos enviamos
20/7/20 2:19 - Lorena: Yo me voy a dormir, mañana ( o tu hoy) luego me contás!
20/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: Tengo sábanas limpias, con olor a suavizante
20/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: Good night bombón!
20/7/20 2:21 - Joe: Aaah ok babe. Sleep super well! Message me tomorrow. Buenas noches 😘 😘
20/7/20 16:31 - Joe: Buenos días! I tried to send a video and a gif but nothing is working 😡
20/7/20 16:38 - Lorena: Buenos días lindo! Cuándo, why??
20/7/20 16:41 - Joe: When I first woke up I tried to send a video saying good morning to you ☀️ but it got stuck saying processing and then I tried to send a gif but that didn’t send either.
20/7/20 18:22 - Lorena: Quiero mi vídeo y mi gif del día de hoy!!!
20/7/20 18:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 18:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 18:42 - Lorena: 👋
20/7/20 19:12 - Joe: This video was not as good as from this morning but that one didn’t save haha.
20/7/20 19:19 - Lorena: 🥺
20/7/20 19:19 - Lorena: Jaja bueno la próxima vez guárdalo jjjj
20/7/20 19:26 - Joe: Hahah I tried but I recorded it in whatsapp. Didn’t see a save option 😔
20/7/20 19:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 20:29 - Lorena: Jajajaa te metió "el sapito"en el ojo
20/7/20 20:29 - Lorena: Así se le dice en español en Uru
20/7/20 20:30 - Lorena: Estas de niñero eh jajaja para que querés ser padre? si ahí tenés un montón de hijos por un rato 😂
20/7/20 20:39 - Joe: Hahaha we were doing origami 😂 Today went by quick. I’m almost out of here already
20/7/20 20:40 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 20:43 - Lorena: Yo casi también
20/7/20 20:43 - Lorena: 20min
20/7/20 21:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:15 - Joe: I got held up by a parent haha but I’m finally free
20/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: Vale estamos free los dos, nos vemos? Jaja
20/7/20 21:27 - Joe: Sure let’s get some beers haha
20/7/20 21:28 - Joe: Fuck I can’t wait for that to be a real thing. Seeing each other after work haha so simple but I’d be stoked
20/7/20 21:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:31 - Lorena: Jaja y a mí! Sería el mejor plan sin duda ahora mismo
20/7/20 21:32 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
20/7/20 21:33 - Lorena: Vale lo borré pq hablé un poco más rápido  y creo que no me entenderías jaja
20/7/20 21:33 - Joe: Deleted?? Boooo
20/7/20 21:34 - Joe: Aaah alright. I could always try haha although I am pretty bad at understand super fast spanish.
20/7/20 21:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:38 - Joe: I’ve been watching videos from this guy lately. It’s difficult cause it’s all in spanish but it’s pushing me to really try to understand what he is saying 

https://www.youtube.com/c/SpanishwithVicente
20/7/20 21:38 - Lorena: Jajaja vale igual creo que en persona podría ser más fácil para nosotros entendernos, gestos!!
20/7/20 21:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:41 - Lorena: Jajaja
20/7/20 21:42 - Lorena: Mirá cuando tengas las palabras vamos a hacer el video de YouTube
20/7/20 21:42 - Lorena: Jajaja mira la gente que reproduce videos de idiomas como este calvo jaja
20/7/20 21:42 - Joe: I realized one other thing that helps me understand is actually being able to watch the persons mouth too. I understand slightly better if I can see the mouth movement
20/7/20 21:43 - Lorena: Claro, es lógico.. a mí también me pasa
20/7/20 21:43 - Joe: But yeah gestures would help a lot too hah
20/7/20 21:43 - Joe: Spanish with Lore and Joe
20/7/20 21:44 - Lorena: Jajaja
20/7/20 21:44 - Lorena: Lo veo claro, es que imagínate que ganas algo de dinero así el vuelo te sale gratis
20/7/20 21:44 - Lorena: Jajaja soy muy pesada cuando se me mete algo en la cabeza
20/7/20 21:45 - Joe: Mmmm bad news about Barcelona sounds not good hahah fuck
20/7/20 21:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:45 - Lorena: Resumen: muchos contagios, cerrarán la ciudad seguramente.. mi empresa es catalana y nos avisó que cerrarán la tienda. Por tanto, todo lo de Barcelona, luego cae en Madrid
20/7/20 21:46 - Joe: Haha I’m the same. I get tunnel vision. Focused on doing the one thing.
20/7/20 21:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: Eso lo puedo confirmar.. jaja siempre me dejaste claro que ibas a venir, de tanto decírmelo te creí jajaja
20/7/20 21:49 - Joe: Haha well once I started to feel like going I told you about it, and when you wanted me to come too my mind was made up haha I have to go now
20/7/20 21:49 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:50 - Lorena: Jajajajajajajaja
20/7/20 21:50 - Lorena: Me encantó!!!!
20/7/20 21:50 - Lorena: Fue el gif perfecto para ese mensaje
20/7/20 21:51 - Joe: 😂
20/7/20 21:51 - Joe: When I was watching Mr Bean yesterday I realized how much of a goldmine for gifs he is. The silent comedy is perfect for making gifs.
20/7/20 21:52 - Lorena: Es verdadddd si
20/7/20 21:52 - Lorena: Jaja al final visite Mr Bean! Jajaja que gracioso
20/7/20 21:52 - Lorena: Que capítulo?

20/7/20 21:53 - Lorena: Sii, capítulo es chapter
20/7/20 21:53 - Joe: Mr Bean takes a selfie or something like that
20/7/20 21:54 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
20/7/20 21:54 - Lorena: El que está con un niño? Puede ser?
20/7/20 21:54 - Lorena: Mierda hace tantos años que lo vi que no recuerdo
20/7/20 21:55 - Joe: Haha it was one where he tries to take a selfie but the camera was too close. So he asked a man to take the picture for him and got his camera stolen haha
20/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Ahhhh
20/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Jajaja si un hombre que le roba corriendo?
20/7/20 21:56 - Joe: I was also watching one where he tried to setup a new tv but it only worked if he stood in a certain spot haha it was good stuff
20/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: Jajaja

20/7/20 22:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 22:00 - Joe: Hahaha we have to find a good way to watch something together from far away 😂
20/7/20 22:01 - Joe: Hahaha I’m sorry I’m trying my best to get closer. I want to get as close as possible hahaha the closest
20/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: Ahhhhh ese me encanta jaja sí es el que intenta copiar a otra persona? Y luego se da cuenta los últimos minutos que había otro papel con información? Jajajaja
20/7/20 22:02 - Lorena: Jajaja vos paciente, lo siento.. lo intento..
20/7/20 22:02 - Lorena: Yo impaciente y caprichosa 🙈🙈
20/7/20 22:02 - Joe: Hahaha that’s the one! You do know your Mr Bean 😂
20/7/20 22:03 - Lorena: Si es mi hombre! Jajaja me hacía gracia muy pequeña cuando lo veía y suelo recordar bien algunos capítulos jaja
20/7/20 22:04 - Joe: This is probably my biggest test of patience ever hahah. I thought I was ready for the long wait but it is hard. I want to go now so badly haha
20/7/20 22:04 - Lorena: Lo más parecido fue cuando estabas viendo El Diario de Noah
20/7/20 22:05 - Lorena: The Notebook
20/7/20 22:05 - Joe: Oh yeah hahah you knew exactly what was happening once I told you where I was at in the movie. You know that movie well 😂
20/7/20 22:06 - Lorena: Jajajaja y ahora vos también
20/7/20 22:06 - Lorena: Cornyyy
20/7/20 22:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 22:07 - Joe: Hahah you’re the only one that gets to see my corny side 😂
20/7/20 22:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 22:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 22:13 - Joe: 😂 😂
20/7/20 22:14 - Joe: I guess I should work on that website a little more. I’m trying to have it up in a week or two. A very basic working prototype at least
20/7/20 22:22 - Lorena: Como es la maquetación?
20/7/20 22:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 22:26 - Joe: Still only have the homepage started but it’s starting to look ok
20/7/20 22:27 - Joe: I’m sure the main page where I layout the list and graph or whatever I make won’t be as easy to design so I’ll probably need your help there. Homepages aren’t so hard since they don’t need much functionality mixed with the design
20/7/20 23:11 - Lorena: 👏
20/7/20 23:11 - Lorena: Tiene buena pinta!
20/7/20 23:11 - Lorena: Pero una página de inicio es lo primero que se ve, no?
20/7/20 23:32 - Joe: Haha thanks!
20/7/20 23:32 - Joe: Yeah the homepage is the first thing you see. You'll click the button and it will bring you to the page for uploading and analyzing the chat
20/7/20 23:38 - Lorena: Genial!
20/7/20 23:39 - Lorena: Que palabras crees que saldrán más?
20/7/20 23:39 - Lorena: Habrá diferencia respecto a la anterior lista?
20/7/20 23:40 - Lorena: Pienso también que hay palabras que ponemos más letras, esas quedarán como anuladas 😬
20/7/20 23:40 - Lorena: Me refiero,por ejemplo... Shiiit.. mierdaaa.. ponemos más letras para dar más énfasis pero la lista afecta a esto jaja
20/7/20 23:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:41 - Joe: I cheated hahah i had to work on the code for the website though
20/7/20 23:42 - Lorena: Jajaj teníamos que usar la web!
20/7/20 23:42 - Joe: Oh yeah a couple of words are going to be messed up because we add so many letters hahah. All good though
20/7/20 23:42 - Lorena: Pero voy a abrirlos jajaj
20/7/20 23:43 - Joe: Hahah i said "shit" 144 times 😂
20/7/20 23:43 - Joe: Not even counting the times i put more letters haha
20/7/20 23:44 - Lorena: Vos decís muchisimas más veces shit jajaha
20/7/20 23:45 - Lorena: Shit, shiiit, shiiittt, shitty
20/7/20 23:45 - Joe: Hahahaha
20/7/20 23:45 - Joe: 😬😬🤷‍♂️
20/7/20 23:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:46 - Joe: Hahahah i didn't know you could do that
20/7/20 23:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:46 - Joe: 😂
20/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: Bienvenido a Whatsapp jjjj
20/7/20 23:47 - Joe: mierda
20/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:47 - Joe: haha ok i need to switch up my vocabulary
20/7/20 23:47 - Joe: hhahahah
20/7/20 23:47 - Joe: nooooo
20/7/20 23:47 - Joe: stop searching my words hahha
20/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: Jajaja Joe mal hablado
20/7/20 23:48 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:48 - Joe: hahah i should work on that. I know when to "turn it off" though. I don't cuss all the time, i swear 🤬
20/7/20 23:49 - Joe: Hahah babe isn't so bad i guess. I have poor vocabulary 🤣
20/7/20 23:49 - Lorena: Jajaja
20/7/20 23:50 - Lorena: Esta justo en el lateral derechos, hay una lupa.ahi podés buscarlo
20/7/20 23:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:52 - Joe: I must be blind I don’t see it haha
20/7/20 23:52 - Joe: 😂 I say the same things all the time! Lame haha
20/7/20 23:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
20/7/20 23:55 - Joe: Aaah ok I had to go back a page to see the search. I haven’t really looked around the app much. I open it and it is always already on our chat
20/7/20 23:58 - Lorena: Jaja
21/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:01 - Joe: That’s not even a lot haha pretty sure i said fuck over 100 times hahaha I use cuss words too much when I talk to you 😂
21/7/20 0:01 - Joe: Shitty shit fuck
21/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Jajaja
21/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:04 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:04 - Joe: Took forever to find that haha
21/7/20 0:04 - Lorena: Esa la usas mucho también
21/7/20 0:04 - Joe: I knew dammit would be on the rise. I’ve been saying that a lot lately 😂
21/7/20 0:04 - Joe: Dammit
21/7/20 0:04 - Lorena: Jajajaja
21/7/20 0:05 - Lorena: Decís malas palabras pero hay muchas buenas también
21/7/20 0:06 - Lorena: Es interesante
21/7/20 0:07 - Joe: Hah yeah I would love to learn how to do sentiment analysis where the computer can tell you if a message is negative or positive. Doing that stuff is complicated and takes a lot of labeled data
21/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Jjjj uy si parece complicado eso!
21/7/20 0:09 - Lorena: Pero podés hacer lo que quieras bombón, libre!
21/7/20 0:09 - Joe: We’ll see where this project goes. I want to do something cool with the text analysis. Make it useful for other people. I also need to make it work for group chats and stuff. Maybe have some graphs showing how much each person is involved in the conversation or something. Like a pie chart
21/7/20 0:09 - Joe: Haha I appreciate you believing in me!
21/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: Si es interesante. Lo único que para que las cifras sean reales habría que ver que el recuento cuente con el significado de la palabra. Eliminando esas letras de énfasis
21/7/20 0:11 - Lorena: Por ejemplo, en español los tildes... Yo muchas veces no los pongo, cuando hablo rápido
21/7/20 0:13 - Joe: Oh yeah huh. Damn that’ll be difficult. Honestly stuff like that is the hardest part about getting this to work haha. They call that cleaning the data. It’ll be tough to find a way to automate finding words like that and fixing them
21/7/20 0:14 - Lorena: Jaja, y las mayúsculas y minúsculas las diferencia?
21/7/20 0:16 - Joe: You do have to account for uppercase and lowercase but that’s easy. Before the computer counts any word I just have it transform it to lowercase first
21/7/20 0:17 - Lorena: Jaja te estoy dando más trabajo
21/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: Por suerte no tengo casi faltas de ortografía, así que eso es un problema menos jaja
21/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: De hecho odio cuando alguien las tiene, como en los memes
21/7/20 0:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:20 - Joe: Haha you hate what? Misspelled words? I think I’m pretty good with spelling....at least in English I am haha
21/7/20 0:20 - Joe: That’s ok. You’re making the project better with the suggestions. I appreciate it
21/7/20 0:23 - Lorena: Jaja eso me alegra que no tengas faltas
21/7/20 0:23 - Lorena: Si, odio la gente que tiene faltas
21/7/20 0:24 - Lorena: Siempre pongo un asterisco corrigiendo 🙈 si tengo confianza .. a mí me gustaría que si tengo una falta me lo digan jaja
21/7/20 0:25 - Lorena: Cuáles serían faltas en inglés?
21/7/20 0:26 - Joe: Hahaa it’s super common for people to put the wrong word when picking from they’re, their, and there
21/7/20 0:27 - Joe: That annoys me haha
21/7/20 0:28 - Joe: Yeah I’ll also do that. I have to make sure whoever I’m talking to knows I’m not an idiot hahah
21/7/20 0:30 - Lorena: 👏
21/7/20 0:31 - Lorena: Jaja yo no lo hago por mi, lo hago por si veo una amiga que tiene una falta o mi hermano o alguien importantes, intento corregirlo... Cada vez se escribe más.. imagina que mal también para un trabajo escribir con faltas de ortografía un correo o cualquier cosa
21/7/20 0:34 - Joe: Hahaha oooh you correct other people?? 😂 that’s funny. I guess you’ve done that for me once or twice but I’m just learning and I need it haha
21/7/20 0:36 - Lorena: Jajaja si, solo a personas de mi alrededor... Muy cercanas jaja pero ya no lo hago tanto.. era como una ayudita
21/7/20 0:36 - Lorena: A vos si te lo hago es por qué no sabes el idioma!!  Como yo tampoco inglés podrías poner millones de asteriscos jajaja
21/7/20 0:37 - Lorena: Pero tener faltas en propio idioma no me gusta, te puede pasar alguna vez... Pero no decir 4 palabras y que dos sean falta de ortografía jaja
21/7/20 0:39 - Lorena: Jaja mira el vídeo que te pase por insta jajaja
21/7/20 0:41 - Joe: Hahahaha!
21/7/20 0:41 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂
21/7/20 0:42 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:43 - Lorena: Jajajaja
21/7/20 0:43 - Lorena: No sé cuántas veces lo vi y me dio tanta risa
21/7/20 0:43 - Lorena: El chico debe ser como dominicano, acento español super cerrado. Pero ella dice cualquier cosa 😂😂
21/7/20 0:47 - Joe: Yeah I can barely understand what the guy is saying but I can definitely tell the girl is WAY off
21/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: Jajajaja
21/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: Hora de dormir para mi!!
21/7/20 0:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:52 - Joe: Alright sleepyhead get some rest. I’m going to go help Kyle with his cars again haha sleep well I’ll talk to you later. Buenos días 😘
21/7/20 0:52 - Joe: Hahahahaha buenos días???? Fuck

21/7/20 0:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 0:55 - Joe: Hahah I know I know

21/7/20 13:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 16:03 - Joe: Hahaha this is what I like to wake up to. With video and a photo from you 😊
21/7/20 17:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 21:17 - Lorena: Jajaja si me arriesgué a despertarte pero como dijimos que no problem, lo mandé en tu madrugada
21/7/20 21:18 - Lorena: Rulitos, que decís? No entiendo esa palabra
21/7/20 21:24 - Joe: “Let’s see it....I missed it. I missed it!” Hahah
21/7/20 21:25 - Joe: Best thing to wake up to. Do it more often haha
21/7/20 21:47 - Lorena: Ah entonces había entendido bien..pero si estás todos los días patinando con tu compañero no?
21/7/20 21:48 - Lorena: Jajaja vale, mañana es mi último día de trabajo.. jaja así que lo haré más seguido
21/7/20 21:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 21:51 - Joe: Yeah we skate together every day at work. But I was trying to film the trick and I missed it. Cut off the landing on accident haha
21/7/20 21:52 - Joe: I’m looking forward to more haha
21/7/20 21:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 21:55 - Lorena: Ahhhh jaja mierda lo perdiste por grabar 🙈
21/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Jajaja 😂
21/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Que tipo de vídeo te gusta recibir?
21/7/20 21:57 - Lorena: O fotos?
21/7/20 22:01 - Joe: Mmmm hahah I mean....I like them all. It’s nice to wake up and see your face. But you can surprise me haha
21/7/20 22:08 - Lorena: Jajaja vale, intentaré que sea algo "bueno"
21/7/20 22:16 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
21/7/20 22:17 - Joe: It’s so cold for summer the last two day. I’m freezing over here haha. When do we get to be on a tropical island together? I’m tired of the cold 😂
21/7/20 23:33 - Lorena: Jajaja que presión
21/7/20 23:34 - Lorena: Jajaja no me hagas pensar en un país tropical, es mi sueño 😭
21/7/20 23:37 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODgxNzkzMDI2MzEwNTgw?igshid=17pdhu2wsz050&story_media_id=2003939208750127213_48221024
21/7/20 23:38 - Lorena: Hay un vídeo que cada vez que veo, no puedo creer que estuve ahí jaja.. mierda no sé si te deja verlo creo que se mandó la carpeta
21/7/20 23:41 - Lorena: Eliminaste este mensaje
21/7/20 23:47 - Lorena: Es que no me deja enviarte ese vídeo que quiero de la playa
21/7/20 23:52 - Joe: It started me from the first video in the folder but I watched them all haha looks amazing
21/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Uno que se ve la playa en video y una casa con césped y la bandera de costa rica, ese me encanta jaja
22/7/20 0:07 - Joe: I still haven’t quite figured you out haha do you travel a lot? How long do you want to be in Madrid?  What do you want to do in say, the next 5 years? I have so many questions right now I don’t know why hahaha
22/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: Boludo.. me puse a montar este mueble a las 12 de la noche para devolver el martillo en mi trabajo y las chicas me vinieron a ayudar jaja y no lo terminamos jaja
22/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Jjaaja vale respondo a tus preguntas
22/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Me gusta viajar, pensaba que viajaba hasta que fui a costa rica y me di cuenta que la gente viaja mucho jaja
22/7/20 1:22 - Lorena: España ( Islas Canarias( Lanzarote y Fuerteventura) Islas Baleares (Mallorca) Cantabria, Asturias, Galicia, Valencia, Cádiz. Resto de países ( Francia, Portugal, Marruecos, Uruguay, Argentina y Costa Rica)  los últimos tres fueron viajes más largos jj
22/7/20 1:24 - Lorena: En Madrid no quiero estar mucho tiempo, a partir de enero era la idea irme, pero ahora no sé muy bien cuando puede ser, todo cambió tanto
22/7/20 1:26 - Lorena: En los próximos 5 años, me gustaría encontrar un trabajo que me motive y crecer profesionalmente, aprender inglés viajando, tener un perro y vivir en una zona de playa
22/7/20 3:15 - Joe: Why couldn’t you finish?? Hahaha too much tinto de verano or what? 😂
22/7/20 3:17 - Joe: Sorry I didn’t respond, I took a nap by accident haha. You’ve been to a lot of places. At least compared to me. I need to do a lot more traveling apparently. Hopefully we can get you out of Madrid soon and to a place you really want to be. 

You’re probably asleep by now. Soooo sleep well, I’ll talk to you tomorrow 😘
22/7/20 8:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:09 - Lorena: Buenos díasss, bien un vídeo al despertarme jjj
22/7/20 8:11 - Lorena: Que bonitaaa socks, como te mira jaja 😍
22/7/20 8:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:13 - Joe: Hahah she is staring at me and. We’re watching a show on Netflix and holding hands 😂
22/7/20 8:14 - Lorena: Mirá qué no era fan de los pitbulls, pero la verdad es que cada vez q veo un video m gusta es como socks
22/7/20 8:15 - Lorena: Su color, esas patas fuertes jaja los ojos .. el chico q nos vende María tiene dos muy parecidas a socks
22/7/20 8:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:20 - Joe: Haha I’m not a huge pitbull fan either but socks is the exception. She is so sweet! I always try to get her to bite me on purpose but she never even growls or shows her teeth to me. I’ve tried for years but she just won’t do it 😂
22/7/20 8:26 - Lorena: Oinsss jjj si es muy buena la verdad!!!
22/7/20 8:32 - Lorena: Que sueño, me estoy tomando un café media dormida jaja
22/7/20 8:36 - Joe: Haha enjoy the coffee. I’ve been having mine extra strong lately
22/7/20 8:36 - Joe: I’m leaving Kyle’s now. Going back home.
22/7/20 8:37 - Lorena: Sigamos con la conver de ayer
22/7/20 8:37 - Lorena: Mí ayer jaja
22/7/20 8:39 - Joe: Haha alright I’ll be home in literally 5 minutes and we can continue 😂
22/7/20 8:44 - Joe: Alright so out of all of these places which did you like the most? Why? What is the longest trip you’ve been on?
22/7/20 8:47 - Lorena: Jaja
22/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Mmm es que Uruguay es muy especial para mí, el primer viaje fue de los mejores, recorrí toda la costa uruguaya con una amiga
22/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Los viajes al norte de España dormía en una van en la playa así que eran geniales también
22/7/20 8:49 - Lorena: Y el de Costa Rica, fue de las mejores experiencias, el país de mis sueños, tropical
22/7/20 8:49 - Lorena: El máximo, 3 meses
22/7/20 8:50 - Lorena: Vos ya me dijiste los lugares donde estuviste. Así que planteo la pregunta de los 5 años que me gustó! Jaja que pensás vos en 5 años?
22/7/20 8:52 - Joe: I haven’t really learned much about Uruguay but I would like to. And traveling and sleeping in a van by the beaches sounds awesome haha
22/7/20 8:52 - Joe: Where did you go for 3 months?
22/7/20 8:54 - Lorena: Ya te contaré algunas cosas y enseñaré fotos para que aprendas de Uruguay . El acento ya lo tenés para ir jajaja
22/7/20 8:54 - Lorena: CR 🇨🇷
22/7/20 8:54 - Joe: Well...recently I realized I have enough money to build my tiny house. So I’m hoping that sometime in the next 5 years I can find some land somewhere I like and be able to buy it. I’d like to spend some time traveling and looking for that perfect place haha
22/7/20 8:55 - Lorena: Tu plan suena genial!!
22/7/20 8:55 - Lorena: Seguramente en Hawaii no? Jjj
22/7/20 8:57 - Joe: Hawaii is extremely high on the list of places haha. I actually have a cousin with about 7 acres of land out there, he grows the Mary haha but I was thinking of building it there. But I’d really prefer to buy my own land
22/7/20 8:57 - Joe: That’s the goal. I want some land and a tiny house.
22/7/20 8:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:58 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
22/7/20 8:58 - Lorena: Yo quiero irme con vos jaja a vivir a Hawaii
22/7/20 8:59 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 8:59 - Joe: Pleaaaaase do! Haha that’s my fucking dream right now
22/7/20 9:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 9:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 9:01 - Lorena: Jajajaja
22/7/20 9:02 - Joe: I would love to see what kind of design you would come up with for a tiny house. You should help me come up with something. I’m ready to start building in the next few years. Literally just need land haha
22/7/20 9:03 - Joe: I’ll pay you if I have to hahaha
22/7/20 9:04 - Lorena: Valee, seguramente sea una opción muy segura después que vengas!
22/7/20 9:04 - Lorena: Jjjj si podemos mirar cosas, puedo ayudarte claro!
22/7/20 9:05 - Lorena: Jamás, para vos es todo gratis jajaja
22/7/20 9:06 - Joe: Thanks. It’ll be the best tiny house ever haha
22/7/20 9:07 - Joe: I tried to design one on google sketch up a while ago. Probably a year or two ago. I’ve wanted to do this for a while hahah. But it was so bad
22/7/20 9:09 - Lorena: Jajaja luego pásame el archivo que lo abro. Tengo el programa instalado.. aunque ahora uso 3DMax
22/7/20 9:09 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 9:09 - Joe: I’ve also been thinking that it depends on where I’m going to put it though. If I build it in a tropical place I’d want it to be super open and way different than if it was going in a wooded area. So that’s tough haha.
22/7/20 9:09 - Joe: Hahahah
22/7/20 9:10 - Lorena: Super abierto a que te referís, más grande?
22/7/20 9:10 - Joe: Too good for the lowly google sketch up now. I’ll have to see if I still have the file. I was using the free online version
22/7/20 9:11 - Lorena: Tenés que inspirarte mucho con otras casas
22/7/20 9:11 - Lorena: Saber la zona es importante claro
22/7/20 9:12 - Lorena: Pero como te gustaría vivir, las dimensiones de las zonas o las ventanas etc
22/7/20 9:12 - Joe: Yeah it would be bigger but like with lots of outdoor space. Maybe in the center or something interesting. I don’t know. I can build whatever I want as long as I keep it small haha
22/7/20 9:12 - Lorena: Yo quiero esta jaja
22/7/20 9:13 - Joe: I need to send pictures of examples of what I’m talking about but I think you get it. I’ll send photos if I come across some
22/7/20 9:13 - Lorena: El bosque me gusta pero lo tropical más.. imagínate todos los aguacates que se podrían plantar, boom boom puede enseñarnos jajaja
22/7/20 9:14 - Lorena: Sisi entiendo! Las casas japonesas pueden ser una inspiración, ellos saben muy bien utilizar espacios pequeños
22/7/20 9:15 - Joe: https://youtu.be/q3Fu2gTDMug
22/7/20 9:15 - Joe: Haha yeah tropical is where it’s at. The ultimate goal haha
22/7/20 9:18 - Joe: I actually visited a coffee plantation and took a tour in Hawaii. There was a house on the property that was very old. Built by a Japanese man when he came to the island. It was small but I really loved the style of it. They had some cool functionality built in
22/7/20 9:21 - Lorena: 😍😍😍😍😍
22/7/20 9:22 - Lorena: Fotos de eso?
22/7/20 9:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 9:23 - Lorena: Por cierto hace un año o así vino un chico por couchsurfing a mí casa, el era de Philadelphia y vivía en Hawaii, Oahu.
22/7/20 9:23 - Joe: Photos of open space tiny houses.
22/7/20 9:24 - Lorena: Digo de esa propiedad antigua
22/7/20 9:24 - Joe: I’m jealous haha and she knows how to do it for cheap. The description says she built it all for $20,000
22/7/20 9:24 - Joe: Including the cost of the land
22/7/20 9:25 - Lorena: TAn barato? Wow

22/7/20 9:26 - Joe: Well...after I come see you and can bring you back with me hahaha
22/7/20 9:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 9:29 - Joe: Mine will probably end up being a generic box like this in the end 😑 😔 
https://youtu.be/ipI-lLwYLhQ
22/7/20 9:30 - Joe: Hahaha
22/7/20 9:31 - Joe: This is cool https://youtu.be/JvHt7L8O_WI

22/7/20 9:32 - Joe: But yeah the size is perfect
22/7/20 9:33 - Lorena: Además es re linda de madera por fuera
22/7/20 9:34 - Joe: I don’t know if I sent you this one before but this chick built a pretty sick house https://youtu.be/LlzpfkjjqOw
22/7/20 9:36 - Lorena: Esta es buena manera para que practique inglés jaja me interesa lo que dice
22/7/20 9:36 - Joe: True true. Ok this is the last one I’ll send you today haha but it is the one that inspires me a lot. I really like this one for some reason https://youtu.be/ZZmWfvLGjVw

Pretty sure I sent this one to you the first time we talked about tiny houses hah
22/7/20 9:37 - Joe: Oh yeah hahah I forgot about that. No Spanish subtitles either so you’ll have to learn to understand haha
22/7/20 9:37 - Lorena: Jaja sí lo entiendo
22/7/20 9:37 - Lorena: Tengo algo de vocabulario de diseño
22/7/20 9:39 - Lorena: Asco de metro no tengo cobertura acabo de ver el primer minuto, super singular la casa.. mágica!
22/7/20 9:40 - Joe: Haha no worries. I was just sending them so you could take a look at what I want to build. Give you some ideas haha.
22/7/20 9:40 - Lorena: Que bonita.. los materiales, tan orgánica
22/7/20 9:40 - Joe: I’m glad we got to continue our conversation a little bit. I have to get to sleep now cause I have work in the morning
22/7/20 9:41 - Joe: We’ll work on some design ideas later haha I want to know what you would want in a house too.
22/7/20 9:42 - Joe: But I’m going to go to sleep now haha I have to get up early
22/7/20 9:42 - Lorena: Estaba viendo el video,lo miraré en casa con mejor sonido
22/7/20 9:43 - Lorena: El metro es muy ruidoso
22/7/20 9:43 - Lorena: Gracias x pasarme ese video, es muy buena la idea de la chica
22/7/20 9:43 - Joe: Haha yeah for sure. Watch it when you get a chance. Let me know which you like the best
22/7/20 9:44 - Lorena: Okey bombón, descansa!!! Intentaré mandarte algo para cuando abras los ojos jaja
22/7/20 9:44 - Lorena: Hecho!! Los miraré todos
22/7/20 9:45 - Joe: Haha alright babe I’ll talk to you later. Have a wonderful day! 😘
22/7/20 16:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:21 - Joe: That’s ok babe. There will be plenty of other days you can send me videos or photos hah. That kid and his dog were so cute right?
22/7/20 16:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:27 - Joe: Hahah I understand a little. Not all of it. But you’re going to the beach in a few days? And had work for 10 days!?
22/7/20 16:29 - Lorena: "Siii obvio cuando este en la playa.. que es en dos días, te mandaré alguna fotito o vídeo del mar.. y nada estoy re feliz boludo.. ya no tengo que trabajar durante 10 días .. bueno nada..espero que me entiendas y que este audio no sea blabla.. y el video del niño con el perrito me encantó!"
22/7/20 16:29 - Lorena: Ahora escúchalo y leelo, tendrá más sentido jjj
22/7/20 16:30 - Joe: Aaaah you don’t have work for 10 days. Way better hahaha mini vacation
22/7/20 16:32 - Joe: I absolutely love the little giggles while you talk hahaha so cute
22/7/20 16:32 - Lorena: En septiembre tengo 13 días más
22/7/20 16:33 - Lorena: Jajaja siempre se me escapan
22/7/20 16:34 - Joe: You have 13 days off in September too? Very nice. I don’t get much vacation time. I just don’t go to work hahaha
22/7/20 16:35 - Lorena: Cuando estoy tan contenta, como ahora.. todo me parece genial.. jaja y lo que me hace bien, por ejemplo.. vos.. es como mejor.. jaja me dan como más ganas de verte .. que pensé que no era posible jaja
22/7/20 16:35 - Lorena: También con más ganas de estar con mi familia, amigas, viajar, a mis perras, jaja es como que la emoción que siento por varias cosas cuando estoy así se acentúa más jaja
22/7/20 16:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:37 - Joe: Hahahaha now this I would accept a video of 😂 😂
22/7/20 16:38 - Lorena: Jajaja nono
22/7/20 16:39 - Lorena: Estoy en el metro tengo que comprarme como una chica normal jaja
22/7/20 16:39 - Joe: This reminded me of this video for some reason hahaha https://www.instagram.com/p/CCTJfL8q4ql/?igshid=1lg2hihxw9sl7
22/7/20 16:40 - Joe: 😂
22/7/20 16:40 - Joe: Perfect time to film a dancing video haha 💃
22/7/20 16:40 - Lorena: Jajajajajajaja mucha gracia que me pases esto vos jaja un meme en español tan acertado
22/7/20 16:41 - Lorena: Jajajaja puede ser algo así real
22/7/20 16:41 - Joe: Like 80% of the memes and funny videos on my Instagram feed are in spanish now haha
22/7/20 16:41 - Lorena: No sé si tanto.. jaja pero la primera parte es muy igual jajaja
22/7/20 16:42 - Lorena: Por cierto hablando de vídeo, me gustó mucho el vídeo de benal que subieron...el tuyo de ese truco
22/7/20 16:42 - Joe: I can imagine you being like that for some reason. Lots of emotion in how you express yourself. Whether it’s loving or frustration haha
22/7/20 16:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:43 - Joe: The first part for sure. Since I could imagine you as the first part it made me wonder if you get like the second part sometimes haha
22/7/20 16:43 - Lorena: Jajaja te podrías la doble mascarilla como el chico del vídeo
22/7/20 16:44 - Lorena: Si yo soy como ambas jajaja
22/7/20 16:44 - Lorena: Pero no me considero una persona amargada eh jaja solo con mucho carácter cuando algo me molesta
22/7/20 16:44 - Joe: Thank you thank you haha. I need to go back and do the whole line of tricks again. I didn’t like how the one I landed turned out at all
22/7/20 16:45 - Lorena: Me da igual tener confianza o no, si algo me molesta lo digo inmediatamente o respondo contundente 🤷
22/7/20 16:47 - Joe: I’m lookin forward to seeing the “angry” Lore for some reason hahah
22/7/20 16:48 - Joe: Though I might end up like the guy in the video, looking scared and confused by the sudden rage hahaha
22/7/20 16:48 - Lorena: En serio? Pero si parece perfecto... Caes perfecto en la tabla..jaja colaboré en dar un me gusta! Jaja no comenté pq no sé ni cual es ese truco.. per estaba genial
22/7/20 16:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 16:49 - Joe: The one I sent you was the one that I landed all three tricks. They came out ugly in the video.
22/7/20 16:50 - Lorena: Los vídeos de esa pareja son geniales... Normalmente el humor español no me hace mucha gracia.. más el uruguayo o argentino
22/7/20 16:50 - Lorena: Pero estos chicos son buenos jaja
22/7/20 16:50 - Joe: The one he posted is different than the final one that I landed all the tricks in. Need to fix the last trick
22/7/20 16:50 - Lorena: Buuuuu mentira no seas humilde jaja salen genial pinochooo
22/7/20 16:51 - Joe: Yeah I’m enjoying their videos haha. I just found them the other day
22/7/20 16:52 - Lorena: Me ganas, no me da tiempo.. vas más rápido y mira que te paso cosas eh jaja
22/7/20 16:53 - Joe: Haha I watch my own stuff very critically. The second trick didn’t look good, very low to the ground, and I didn’t slide the ledge very much on the last trick. Just tapped it. And my foot lands funny on the board.
22/7/20 16:53 - Joe: I’m talking about the final version of the video clip I sent you though, not the version that got posted on Benal.
22/7/20 16:54 - Lorena: Ahhhhh
22/7/20 16:54 - Lorena: Jajaja
22/7/20 16:54 - Lorena: Entonces estamos hablando de dos cosas diferentes
22/7/20 16:54 - Lorena: Yo decía el de Benal!
22/7/20 16:57 - Joe: I wonder what i should do after skate camp. I was hoping that when it was over I would be able to come see you 😔
22/7/20 16:58 - Joe: Next week is the last week of camp. Then I have to find something else to do. But I prefer to just leave California and go meet you somewhere. They won’t let me! You’ll end up having a visa and coming to the states before they let me go to Spain dammit.
22/7/20 17:01 - Lorena: Acabas en una semana? No sabía! Pensé que era hasta septiembre!!!
22/7/20 17:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 17:02 - Joe: I thought it was at least middle of August that camp would go until. But yeah, next week is the last week
22/7/20 17:03 - Lorena: 😮 super pronto!
22/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: Si a mí me encantaría ir .. pero no puedo irme ahora de aca teniendo trabajo con esta situación.. tengo contrato por un año.. me puedo ir antes.. pero no tanto jaja
22/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: Pero vos tenés que venirrr jajaja
22/7/20 17:04 - Joe: Shiiiiiit I better get my ass over there then
22/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: No te agarrés ningún trabajo estable
22/7/20 17:04 - Lorena: Jajaja
22/7/20 17:05 - Lorena: Trabajo tengo contrato indefinido, es muy difícil que me echen.. me iré yo antes
22/7/20 17:05 - Lorena: Pero de la casa tengo un año
22/7/20 17:05 - Joe: I’m going to be poor 😢
22/7/20 17:05 - Joe: I’m kidding. I have a friend that might be willing to give me a temporary job knowing I’ll leave at any minute hah
22/7/20 17:06 - Lorena: Jajaaja. Agarra un trabajo pero que puedas dejarlo para venir a verme
22/7/20 17:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 17:06 - Joe: Hahahahaha
22/7/20 17:07 - Joe: Alright babe I have to leave for work now. I enjoyed our morning conversation today very much haha.
22/7/20 17:08 - Joe: My day should be pretty short so I’ll talk to you soon! I have to get on the road now or I’m going to be late. Have a good evening! 😘
22/7/20 17:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 17:09 - Lorena: Yo también!!! Te como
22/7/20 17:09 - Lorena: Buena mañana, que vaya todo bien! Un beso fuerteee
22/7/20 17:11 - Joe: Awww I miss you too! Thanks babe! Time to get my day started haha I’ll talk to you soon!
22/7/20 21:18 - Joe: Almost free! They had me stay an extra 30 minutes to monitor the park.
22/7/20 21:31 - Lorena: Ya estás casi fueraa
22/7/20 21:32 - Lorena: Por cierto y las clases particulares siguen no? En una semana corta el Camp solo no?
22/7/20 21:46 - Joe: No private lessons this week. Might do them again next week though
22/7/20 21:47 - Joe: I just spent like 20 minutes arguing with a bicycle rider about them not being allowed in the park. The only part of the job I don’t like haha. Grown men on bikes can’t just follow the rules 😂
22/7/20 22:07 - Joe: Woohoo I’m free. I’m going to go film with my friends now. Need to finish this video part
22/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Son estúpidos, además lo saben de sobra, lo sé hasta yo jaja que no se permite en la mayoría
22/7/20 22:13 - Lorena: Bueno jajaja si, no? Porque se estropean "los cosos" del cemento
22/7/20 22:13 - Lorena: Palabra nueva: cosos. Es una de las palabras que más digo jaja .. cuando no sé cómo se llama algo me refiero a ello como "coso"
22/7/20 22:14 - Lorena: Yihaaaaa. Suerte, tené cuidado! Protector y gorro! Jaja
22/7/20 22:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
22/7/20 22:17 - Lorena: Enjoyyyy
22/7/20 22:17 - Joe: Hahaha
22/7/20 22:18 - Joe: Yeah the damn biker was getting on my nerves. He apologized for being an asshole when he left though haha
22/7/20 22:19 - Joe: Cosos sounds so much like cosas I’m sure I’ll get it confused almost every time I hear it hahah but I’ll try to pick up the meaning of your versatile word. Cosos
23/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: Jajaja me gustaría ver esa faceta tuya también , de los nervios
23/7/20 0:02 - Lorena: Jajaja cosas es como general, por ejemplo.. " mis cosas están en mi taquilla" como objetos en general o para expresar como algo relacionado con asuntos personales.. "mis cosas(asuntos personales) están bien"
23/7/20 0:03 - Lorena: Sin embargo cosos.. es como cuando no sabes cómo se llama algún objeto o no tiene un nombre específico. Ejemplo... " Ese coso que hay en el skatepark con forma de U"
23/7/20 0:24 - Joe: I still try to stay pretty nice. Kill them with kindness haha. It usually works out.
23/7/20 0:24 - Joe: Aaah ok. They seem super similar in use haha. But I somewhat see the difference
23/7/20 0:33 - Lorena: Jajaja tanto tiempo hablando con ese hombre para q no use la bici jajaj
23/7/20 0:47 - Lorena: Que tal patinando? Grabaste algo?
23/7/20 0:59 - Joe: Filming is going as usual. Got some footage but it didn’t come out how I want haha. I’m too picky sometimes but I just want the video to be good
23/7/20 0:59 - Joe: I’m watching Paz try a trick now.
23/7/20 1:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/7/20 1:01 - Lorena: Jjj paz pedalea fuerte
23/7/20 1:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
23/7/20 1:03 - Joe: Hahahaha
23/7/20 1:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/7/20 1:06 - Joe: He is trying a pretty hard trick. I’m entertained haha so hungry though. I’m ready for him to land it so we can eat!
23/7/20 1:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
23/7/20 1:12 - Lorena: Jaja pedalea bien, pero el perrito me gustó jjjj
23/7/20 1:15 - Joe: Hahaha I like the puppy too. That shit made me laugh 😂
23/7/20 1:17 - Lorena: Jajaj
23/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Y vosss, no te veo

23/7/20 16:07 - Joe: I definitely could use some more shows and stuff. Need more practice all the time
23/7/20 16:10 - Lorena: Stateless
23/7/20 16:11 - Lorena: Es en inglés, aunque podrás poner sub en spanish
23/7/20 16:12 - Joe: Aaah sweet. They’ll probably have it. I’ll put spanish subtitles too I guess haha
23/7/20 16:12 - Lorena: Es muy cortita, pero básicamente es un centro en el que detienen a inmigrantes donde en sus países vivir e si inhumano y piden asilo en Australia
23/7/20 16:13 - Lorena: Vivir *ES inhumano
23/7/20 16:14 - Joe: Ok that sounds pretty good. I’ll watch some tonight
23/7/20 16:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

23/7/20 16:35 - Joe: Hahaha I was going to send you a very similar video this morning of me in my towel after I got out of the shower 😂 I decided it was a bad idea hahaha

24/7/20 4:57 - Lorena: Llevamos marihuana en las tetas cada una jajaj y huele mucho!!!
24/7/20 4:58 - Joe: Haha ok maybe not the first. But I hope you get a spot! That is too far to go and not get a spot at the beach hahaha i would be kind of bummed if I went that far and it was full ha
24/7/20 4:59 - Joe: Hahahah careful with that. They’ll think you’re a bunch of drug smugglers 😂
24/7/20 4:59 - Lorena: Jajaja eso espero... Es viernes
24/7/20 4:59 - Joe: You got weed that is too good. Too much smell haha

24/7/20 5:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:07 - Joe: Hahaha I wonder if the beers will be enough 😂 that car is going to be stuffed. Full car.
24/7/20 5:07 - Joe: Looks like you’re going to have a lot of fun. I really like going on long trips with my friends. I wish we did it more often though!
24/7/20 5:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

24/7/20 5:12 - Lorena: Me alegra a no estés satisfecho con ellos ajjaja
24/7/20 5:12 - Joe: Hahah I was looking for so long for some good ones. I started to get frustrated with the selection and gave up. Sent a crappy one 😡
24/7/20 5:13 - Lorena: Jajajaj
24/7/20 5:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:14 - Lorena: Buuuuu
24/7/20 5:14 - Joe: I didn’t even work on any coding. I took a nap after working on the fence haha. I should probably do a little bit.
24/7/20 5:14 - Joe: Hahaha a gif for not being able to find a gif. Satisfactory 🤣
24/7/20 5:16 - Lorena: Jajaj estás vago!
24/7/20 5:16 - Lorena: Bueno algún día no pasa nada y además trabajaste por la mañana
24/7/20 5:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:23 - Joe: Haha yeah working outside in the sun and skating all morning makes me pretty tired. And working on the fence too haha.
24/7/20 5:25 - Lorena: Jjj claro, disfrutá y descansa m. Que hiciste cosas físicas.. tendrás mucho tiempo para codificación jjj
24/7/20 5:25 - Lorena: Estas practicando con Nelly?
24/7/20 5:27 - Joe: It’s been a few days since I practiced with Nelly
24/7/20 5:27 - Joe: Also I lost my notebook 📒
24/7/20 5:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:29 - Joe: All the notes I took with Nelly were in there. All the notes I took with you were in there! Bummer
24/7/20 5:30 - Joe: Guess I’ll have to start a new notebook. But I really wish I didn’t lose that one. It had a bunch of notes I would have liked to keep. Especially the ones from you teaching me while I was in Hawaii
24/7/20 5:33 - Lorena: Noooo!!! Sería una pena que pierdas eso!! No sé habrá quedado en el skatepark?
24/7/20 5:34 - Lorena: No me digas que lo perdiste de verdad.. joeee 😔
24/7/20 5:36 - Joe: I’m hoping it pops up at the skatepark or something. I brought it there so it would be there or in my car but I searched my car extremely well looking for it haha
24/7/20 5:37 - Joe: But it’s been missing for a few days now. I better find that thing. Shit
24/7/20 5:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 5:43 - Joe: I’m going to search the skatepark office and the little cart we use during camp extra thoroughly tomorrow. I need that thing back haha. After your 3 day adventure we’ll have to do some more lessons too. I enjoyed getting lists of words and phrases from you to learn
24/7/20 5:44 - Joe: And I miss you always making me say things in spanish even though it was embarrassing. I’m getting better so it’s not as embarrassing but I still have my moments haha. Codificatión 😂
24/7/20 5:44 - Lorena: Claro, cuando quieras!!! Podemos practicar con palabras, canciones, etc
. Como hacíamos antes jaja
24/7/20 5:46 - Lorena: Mejoraste mucho! Apuesto a que podrías decir ya codificación y ronronear jaja. Pero el video que me mandaste que estás abrigado, hablas bien! Excepto codificación que suena como "corificsion"
24/7/20 5:52 - Joe: It’s really hard for me to make the d and r sound different haha. But I don’t even notice that I’m saying the d like an r until you tell me
24/7/20 5:52 - Joe: I’ll have to catch myself more often or I’ll make a bad habit of that haha
24/7/20 5:57 - Lorena: Nah tranquilo, eso le pasa a todos " los guiris" jajaja
24/7/20 5:58 - Lorena: Todos pronuncian la d como r.. por eso te lo digo antes pq entiendo que para vos es difícil pronunciarla .. pero mira el niño la pronunciaba más fuerte y la niña más suave
24/7/20 6:02 - Lorena: Pero vos te podés reír de mi también seguro que pronuncio muchas cosas raras jaja tendré que volver a ponerme
24/7/20 6:03 - Lorena: Dicen que la mejor manera de aprender es un idioma es viajando o cuando conoces a alguien que te gusta jaja . Motivación.
24/7/20 6:05 - Joe: I just want to say it however it is supposed to be said haha the correct way
24/7/20 6:05 - Joe: It has been a while since I’ve gotten you to send me audio of you speaking English hahaha
24/7/20 6:06 - Joe: Hahaha you’ve been the only person to get me motivated enough to actually learn Spanish. I’ve learned a lot since I “met” you
24/7/20 6:08 - Lorena: jaja me acuerdo del día que vi Notebook y apunté todas las palabras y te las repetí como un loro jajaja
24/7/20 6:09 - Lorena: jajaja me alegro! Y más que vas a aprender, mi desconocido preferido!
24/7/20 6:21 - Joe: Hahaha I need more of that kind of stuff 😂
24/7/20 6:24 - Joe: You might be the only person that I talk to every single day haha it’s crazy how long really knowing someone can take. Over time people change thoug so there is always more to learn about them
24/7/20 6:24 - Joe: I’m going to need to learn a lot more than 1000 words haha
24/7/20 6:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 6:39 - Lorena: A que te referís, que lleva poco o mucho tiempo conocer a alguien?
24/7/20 6:41 - Lorena: Ohh la única jaja me haces sentir especial!
24/7/20 6:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 6:42 - Joe: I mean it takes a lot of time to understand another person deeply I guess
24/7/20 6:42 - Joe: Hahaha
24/7/20 6:43 - Joe: Yeah you haha
24/7/20 6:44 - Lorena: Sii, aunque lo principal para conocernos fue en Hawaii
24/7/20 6:44 - Lorena: Que ahí nos preguntábamos cosas de nuestra forma de ser, etc
24/7/20 6:47 - Joe: All of my hopes and plans are being destroyed by coronavirus though 😭 I was really hoping that by I’d be planning the trip by now. Not still waiting for my passport and opening of the borders
24/7/20 6:49 - Lorena: Ya... Pero bueno lo conseguiremos
24/7/20 6:49 - Lorena: Lo bueno es que nos conocimos y podemos pensar en ello
24/7/20 6:51 - Lorena: Después de conocer a un extraño, no hablar ninguno el idioma, y tener tantas horas de diferencia horaria 12 y 9.. pienso que sí superamos eso podemos conseguir vernos en algún momento
24/7/20 6:53 - Joe: Haha the most difficult “relationship” ever 😂 I’m glad all of those obstacles didn’t deter you from being interested in me
24/7/20 6:53 - Joe: We’ll definitely meet eventually. I’m keeping an eye out for that passport and any news about travel opening up
24/7/20 6:54 - Lorena: Jajaja supongo que me gusta complicarme la vida
24/7/20 6:59 - Lorena: Por momentos cuando te digo que te echo de menos o te mando algún video "sexy" siento que te conozco de antes jaja será que es posible crear confianza mientras que no sea posible vernos personalmente
24/7/20 7:08 - Joe: Hahha yeah it seems like it
24/7/20 7:09 - Joe: Oh yeah for sure. I know what you mean, I feel the same.
24/7/20 7:11 - Joe: It’s actually been going really well haha i don’t really want to put labels on it or whatever but this would be my first “long distance relationship” and it’s not the worst thing in the world I guess haha not being able to see you sucks but it’s a different experience. Definitely difficult at times though hahah cause I just want to touch you
24/7/20 7:20 - Lorena: Jajaj si el tema del contacto.. yo lo pienso muchas veces y digo dios quiero tocarle el pelo o la cara o algo jajaja
24/7/20 7:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 7:24 - Lorena: En unos días te mandaré una carta, no sé cuándo llegará jajaja
24/7/20 7:25 - Joe: Ugh I think the same thing all the time haha
24/7/20 7:26 - Joe: I’ll satisfy these urges soon enough. It’ll be interesting when we meet. I’ll barely be able to talk to you but I’ll also want to be all over you from all this time I couldn’t touch you haha
24/7/20 7:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 7:27 - Joe: I’m looking forward to receiving this letter haha
24/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: Jajajaja me pregunto cómo serás dando un beso o un abrazo
24/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: O cómo serás en la cama, espero que bueno jajaj🤭🤭
24/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: Siiii, decime la dire porfi
24/7/20 7:35 - Joe: 🤷‍♂️
24/7/20 7:35 - Joe: Hahahaha fuck the pressure is on 😂
24/7/20 7:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
24/7/20 7:39 - Lorena: Jajajaja, es broma.. me gusta ponerte nervioso jaja
24/7/20 7:41 - Joe: It worked 😂
24/7/20 7:41 - Lorena: Con vos no me importará nada de eso, creo que será bueno por qué me gustas mucho, creo que con tocarme lo mínimo podría ser genial jajaja
24/7/20 7:42 - Joe: Haha don’t worry I’m alright in bed. Not winning any awards over here but no one has complained Hahahaha
24/7/20 7:43 - Joe: Aaah I can’t wait to be with you. It’ll be fun haha
24/7/20 7:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

25/7/20 18:06 - Lorena: Casi sin cobertura en esa zona y estaba abajo la playa
25/7/20 18:08 - Lorena: Me quiero quedar a vivir acá
25/7/20 18:19 - Joe: It looks awesome. I can see why it’s your favorite. The cliffs by the beach remind me of Santa Cruz.
25/7/20 18:20 - Joe: How is the water there? Pretty cold or not so bad?
25/7/20 18:25 - Lorena: Si me encanta. La playa es como más salvaje, tipo calas, con rocas y más pequeña.. aunque estaba un poco dividida había mucha gente desnuda.. nudismo jjj
25/7/20 18:26 - Lorena: El agua buenísima! Perdí la cuenta cuántos baños me di  jaja
25/7/20 18:27 - Lorena: Nada fría, muy agradable y mucho calor! Ahora tengo que comprobar si estoy tomate cuando me saque la ropa jaja
25/7/20 18:32 - Joe: Sounds great haha I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself so much! Send a picture if you’re a tomato later hahaha you’ve gotten a bunch of photos and videos of me as a tomato. Time for payback 😂

25/7/20 19:42 - Joe: Hahaha I appreciated it very much 😂 I just got a little distracted haha
25/7/20 19:56 - Joe: Haha yeah I try to tell you pretty much everything but after the shit with the last job, I don’t know, I didn’t want this to fall through also and you think I can’t get a job or something hahah
25/7/20 20:22 - Joe: Damn you got hella color from today haha I couldn’t really tell when I watched it before but compare it to the picture you sent me early in the day and you are definitely much more red 😂

25/7/20 20:53 - Joe: Super cute. Looks comfy haha sometimes I wonder what it would be like to wear a dress 😂 I probably wouldn’t try it but the airflow seems like it would be pretty nice hahaha
25/7/20 20:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
25/7/20 20:54 - Lorena: Jajajajaja tu opinión
25/7/20 20:54 - Lorena: Lo interesante que sería usar un vestido por la ventilación

26/7/20 18:27 - Joe: Oh ok you’ve been on the road for a while now. The trip is almost done. It seems like the trip went great eh?
26/7/20 18:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:27 - Lorena: Siiii, pero muy corto. Así que en septiembre vuelvo jjj
26/7/20 18:30 - Joe: Aw that dog is hella cute. It has the eye patch almost like the emoji haha 🐶
26/7/20 18:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:31 - Joe: Yeah it didn’t seem like you got to do too much. But beach and some partying is not bad, especially during coronavirus haha. Hard to do much
26/7/20 18:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:31 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:31 - Joe: Where is your hat?
26/7/20 18:32 - Joe: Aaaah wait...there it is hahaha
26/7/20 18:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:33 - Lorena: Jajajaja si no me desprendí de el durante los días de playa
26/7/20 18:33 - Joe: Oh so this is super random but you have more friends on WhatsApp so you can help me with this. Do any of the people you add on WhatsApp have weird usernames? Like do you ever see first and last name with a space or random numbers after a name?
26/7/20 18:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:34 - Joe: I’m trying to write some code to find all the users in a chat but I’m not sure if usernames are always just one name or if people put all kinds of things for their name on here?
26/7/20 18:35 - Lorena: Mmm no entiendo
26/7/20 18:35 - Joe: Hahaa always with beer
26/7/20 18:35 - Lorena: Cuando te hacés WhatsApp podés poner un nombre o texto o lo que quieras
26/7/20 18:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:37 - Joe: Shit this is going to be hard in that case haha dammit.
26/7/20 18:37 - Joe: Ok you answered my question. Thank you
26/7/20 18:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:38 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:39 - Joe: Basically I want my code to recognize the usernames of each person in the chat. But it’s hard if there are no rules for what you can put as a someone’s name in WhatsApp
26/7/20 18:40 - Lorena: Y que tú código reconozca el número de teléfono? O los últimos dígitos?
26/7/20 18:40 - Joe: So now instead of making my code recognize just names it will have to recognize phone numbers and any other possibilities people could put for the name
26/7/20 18:41 - Joe: I can make it recognize phone numbers and names. I’ve done something like that before so hopefully I can just apply that code to this problem
26/7/20 18:42 - Lorena: Aha
26/7/20 18:42 - Lorena: Y para que sería esto?
26/7/20 18:42 - Lorena: Para la página de las palabras?
26/7/20 18:45 - Joe: Yeah it’s for the words page. I want you to be able to take any of your chats and upload the file. Then the program should find each user in the chat and organize all of their messages and generate a report with the 1000 most used words and some charts or graphs or something
26/7/20 18:47 - Lorena: Aha, muy bien 👌
26/7/20 18:52 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 18:55 - Lorena: Jaja esto suele ser lo normal ni? Más difícil de lo que parece
26/7/20 18:56 - Lorena: *no?
26/7/20 18:59 - Joe: Haha yeah almost every time it ends up harder than it originally seems
26/7/20 19:01 - Lorena: Jaja y cuál es el objetivo de esta web?
26/7/20 19:02 - Joe: Haha good question 🤔
26/7/20 19:03 - Joe: It’s mostly for practice. And to make it easy for me to run the code on the chat again but also let other people analyze their chats.
26/7/20 19:04 - Joe: So you can do a group chat and see who talks the most. What is said the most. What each person says. I just want to provide a general analysis of the chat.
26/7/20 19:07 - Lorena: Aha muy bien!
26/7/20 19:09 - Lorena: Bueno, si puedo ayudarte en algo en tu práctica...ya sabés que podés decírmelo
26/7/20 19:11 - Joe: I’ll probably need help coming up with a decent simple design for the page that you upload the file and get back the results but plenty of time for that haha I’ll recruit you for that later 😂
26/7/20 19:12 - Joe: You already helped today with the information about the name of the contacts in the chat. Very useful.
26/7/20 19:13 - Lorena: Jaja okey trato hecho! 😉
26/7/20 19:16 - Lorena: Tengo depresión post vacacional y aún no llegué a Madrid
26/7/20 19:20 - Joe: Damn haven’t even made it back and the sadness has kicked in haha. You’ll go back soon!
26/7/20 19:23 - Lorena: Jajaja es que me gusta mucho eso, vamos a un lugar de mar? Jaja
26/7/20 19:27 - Joe: I can’t wait to be with you. We’ll go wherever you want haha
26/7/20 19:28 - Joe: Oh and me and my friends have a term for the post fun trip sadness. It’s a “happy hangover” haha
26/7/20 19:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 19:34 - Lorena: Jajaja llevo un rato mirando gif de abrazos, hay diferentes niveles corny cursi jaja
26/7/20 19:34 - Lorena: Me gusta!! Es buena jaja
26/7/20 19:39 - Joe: Hahaha I know what you mean. Sometimes I want to send you a hug gif but some are very corny 😂 I accept your hug gif though. I would love to be like that with you right now!
26/7/20 19:40 - Joe: Haha I haven’t used the term in a while but it’s useful. Definitely seems like a real thing. For some people more than others. We made the term for one friend that was always extra sad shortly after having a lot of fun haha
26/7/20 19:49 - Lorena: Jajaja lo peor es que los miraba todos
26/7/20 19:50 - Lorena: Se que envíe uno cursi pero tenía que enviar uno de ese tipo jaja gracias por aceptarmelo 😂
26/7/20 19:50 - Lorena: Jajaja me gusta si si, me siento ahora como tu amigo
26/7/20 20:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 20:05 - Joe: It’s great though. Get to do what I love. Dream come true or something haha
26/7/20 20:06 - Joe: Truth is I always accept the corny stuff from you. I think it’s great cause you aren’t typically super corny, so I appreciate it when you’re corny to me hahah
26/7/20 20:11 - Lorena: Me alegro un montón!!!!
26/7/20 20:14 - Joe: Un montón. That’s new to me haha. I wish I had my notebook! I had a dream that I found it 😩
26/7/20 20:44 - Lorena: Jajaja esta aclaración 😅Siento por momentos que soy más cursi de lo normal si... Pero te tengo mimado jajaja con "ñoñerias cursis"
26/7/20 20:44 - Lorena: Ohhh no! No quiero que esté perdido ese cuaderno, es parte de nuestra historia de idiomas
26/7/20 20:45 - Lorena: Jaja otra cursilada
26/7/20 20:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 20:49 - Lorena: La primera vez que me escuchas decir un montón? Lo digo un montón de veces jajaja
26/7/20 20:53 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 20:53 - Joe: I know. I really hope it shows up somewhere
26/7/20 20:53 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/7/20 20:54 - Lorena: Ya aprendiste a el buscador de WhatsApp jaja qué peligro
26/7/20 20:54 - Lorena: Y pensar que ni tenías instalado WhatsApp jajaja
26/7/20 20:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 20:56 - Lorena: Jajajaja
26/7/20 20:57 - Joe: I don’t even know what to search though haha. You came up with all kinds of stuff to search of me. You’re good at embarrassing me 😂
26/7/20 21:00 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/7/20 21:00 - Lorena: Aburrido
26/7/20 21:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:01 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:01 - Lorena: Nooooonono
26/7/20 21:02 - Lorena: Jaja perdónnn
26/7/20 21:02 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:02 - Joe: Hahah it’s all good. I probably am boring 😂
26/7/20 21:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:07 - Joe: Hahaha

26/7/20 21:11 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:14 - Joe: Haha yeah biggie is a little monster. I was just trying to hangout with socks and Biggie came barging in to take all the attention haha
26/7/20 21:16 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/7/20 21:16 - Lorena: Biggie está celoso, como yo. Siempre le das más atención a socks jajaja
26/7/20 21:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:20 - Joe: Haha Socks is my girl! We go back many years together haha
26/7/20 21:21 - Joe: If you were here you’d get all my attention though 😆
26/7/20 21:22 - Joe: That reminds me of the post I sent you. And raises a question haha how jealous do you get?? https://www.instagram.com/p/CDC2QwcgSo7TBiSlHGlpEdaBQYSddHAKMcNbyc0/?igshid=1kgbs2alq3u1u
26/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: No me deja ver el link así
26/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: Lo entiendo jaja pero entiendo a Biggie también jajaja
26/7/20 21:24 - Joe: Ah damn. Well it’s the very last post I sent you
26/7/20 21:24 - Lorena: Creo que deberías venir en el avión con socks. Me apetece conocerla
26/7/20 21:25 - Lorena: Ah mierda la vi y no te respondí me acabo d dar cuenta
26/7/20 21:26 - Lorena: Jajaja si algo como esa niña
26/7/20 21:28 - Joe: Hahah I guess I’ll find out one day 😂
26/7/20 21:28 - Lorena: Jajaja
26/7/20 21:28 - Lorena: Vos sos celoso?
26/7/20 21:31 - Joe: Mmm not very much or at least I try to be very reasonable about it if I am jealous.
26/7/20 21:32 - Joe: But if I trust you then I trust you. That’s it. I’ll give you all my trust but if something was to happen it’s hard to get it back I would say.
26/7/20 21:40 - Lorena: Tiene sentido, es lógico
26/7/20 21:42 - Joe: Yeah. And really the only thing I ask for is honesty. I don’t expect you to be a perfect person but I would appreciate honesty about mistakes. I’ll try my best to do the same.
26/7/20 21:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Sos admirable y tierno, me gustaría que estés en mi vida realmente
26/7/20 21:56 - Lorena: Como en las pelis!! 😂 Quiero unoo
26/7/20 21:59 - Joe: Like in the movies??? No ice cream man in Spain!?
26/7/20 21:59 - Joe: Or maybe just not in the car with the song and everything?
26/7/20 22:00 - Joe: I’m on my way. Just very very slowly
26/7/20 22:00 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: Jajaja gifs en todo momento
26/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: No acá no hay hombre de los helados jaja
26/7/20 22:02 - Lorena: Solo en alguna zona de playa puede haber una furgoneta con una persona que vende helados pero fija. No circula la furgo jjj
26/7/20 22:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 22:07 - Joe: Haha damn that’s funny. I didn’t even think about it when I sent the video. The ice cream man literally pulled up in front of Kyle’s place while we’re working on the car haha
26/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Jajaja no cayeron en la tentación de comprar uno?
26/7/20 22:11 - Lorena: Cuál es tu sabor preferido?
26/7/20 22:12 - Lorena: Más cosas diferentes entre nuestras culturas jaja
26/7/20 22:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
26/7/20 22:19 - Joe: I got some stuff but not ice cream haha. Like a coffee type drink. One of those already made kind you get at the store in a bottle
26/7/20 22:21 - Joe: Hmm I don’t know. I like orange sherbet. Or like a vanilla with some chocolate and nuts. Oh or a coffee ice cream. Coffee ice cream is delicious 😋
26/7/20 22:23 - Joe: Whew got burned a little. I like all the accessories. You have so many haha
27/7/20 0:46 - Lorena: Jajaja te encantá el café.. a mí helados me gustan de sabores tropicales, como maracuyá, mango, o algo diferente como pistacho! Hace poco lo descubrí y es una delicia
27/7/20 0:49 - Lorena: Jaja sí me gustan las joyas de Plata o artesanales. Tengo varios anillos antes vendía jaja cuando era más joven.. y ahora en la playa me compré la tobillera, un anillo y una pulsera. Que accesorio te gusta más, por curiosidad? Pendientes, anillos, pulseras, tobilleras?
27/7/20 0:50 - Lorena: Parece estúpida la pregunta, pero a lo mejor hay algo de eso que te gusta o que no te guste
27/7/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha you would like tropical flavors. I’ve heard of pistachio flavor ice cream but never tried it myself
27/7/20 0:58 - Joe: Hmmm I guess my favorite is maybe the one on your wrist. Just because of how it looks. The rings are cool too. I like the ankle one, mostly for the placement, you have nice legs ☺️
27/7/20 1:00 - Lorena: El próximo día que pase la van de los helados, probá pistacho! 🤤
27/7/20 1:02 - Lorena: mis preguntas jaja pobre Joe
27/7/20 1:03 - Lorena: Gracis jaja me alegro que te gustenn 😄
27/7/20 1:10 - Joe: Haha I don’t know if the ice cream man has pistachio but I’ll ask
27/7/20 1:11 - Joe: Ask all the questions you can think of haha I don’t mind
27/7/20 1:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 8:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 8:37 - Lorena: cuál es tu tarea ahí abajo? Jajaj
27/7/20 8:52 - Joe: We were putting the differential back in. Got it welded so the car would slide better. But it’s still not done 😩
27/7/20 8:55 - Lorena: 😬 cuánto trabajo llevan esos coches
27/7/20 8:57 - Joe: It wouldn’t be so much work if we weren’t trying to drive them all crazy haha we have to get it set up just right
27/7/20 9:01 - Lorena: Ahh bueno, pues muy bien! A ver si lo conduces ya
27/7/20 9:01 - Lorena: Que es Diesel o Gasolina?
27/7/20 9:12 - Joe: Hahah I drove it today but just like a normal person. No drifting or anything.
27/7/20 9:12 - Joe: It’s a gasoline car. Diesels are pretty rare
27/7/20 9:12 - Joe: I’ve never had one
27/7/20 9:13 - Joe: As usual you just wake up and I’m going to sleep.
27/7/20 9:14 - Joe: I have to get up early haha. I miss you though! I hope you have a great day. I’ll talk to you when I wake up. Buenas noches babe 😘 😘
27/7/20 9:17 - Lorena: No lo vi! Jaja
27/7/20 9:18 - Lorena: No? Jaja yo diésel siempre. Probé gasolina una vez que el coche estaba en mi taller y no paraba de calarse.. es diferente jaja
27/7/20 9:18 - Joe: Haha I didn’t think you wanted to see regular driving. I can do that pretty good with the manual car even though I just learned. It’s the sliding of the car that’s hard haha
27/7/20 9:19 - Lorena: Jaja quiero verlo también
27/7/20 9:20 - Joe: Oh haha Ok next time I drive I’ll get video. My bad i didn’t realize you wanted video of me driving like a grandpa 👴🏽
27/7/20 9:21 - Joe: You’ll have to tell me more about the differences later haha I’m interested. Never tried a diesel car myself.
27/7/20 9:21 - Joe: Buuut I am going to sleep now haha. I’m super tired. We can talk all about diesel vs gasoline later 😂
27/7/20 9:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 9:53 - Lorena: Jajaja de ambos . Abuelo y "adolescente rebelde"
27/7/20 9:57 - Lorena: La diferencia es al arrancar ..  diesel es mas rápido y el gasolina tarda más con acelerador
27/7/20 9:58 - Lorena: Y luego las marchas.. en el gasolina se cambian mucho más rápido no necesitas que se revolucione tanto el motor sin embargo en diesel si, son más largas ..por eso la gente que conduce con diesel y luego agarra gasolina, se le "cala" el coche, el ahoga y el motor se apaga
27/7/20 10:01 - Lorena: Mierda te iba respondiendo a medida que iba leyendo.. jaja ya verás las diferencias cuando te despiertes jajaja
27/7/20 15:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 15:07 - Lorena: Cada vez que abro un aguacate, es un segundo de incertidumbre por si está malo jaja es como una sorpresa.. bueno o... Como el video tardee! Jaja y me acuerdo de lo mucho que te gustó jaja
27/7/20 15:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 15:36 - Lorena: 🤪
27/7/20 15:42 - Joe: ❤️ 😊 buenos días!! I miss you 😘
27/7/20 15:43 - Joe: Hahaha I didn’t expect that audio but I love it. You sound super sweeeeet
27/7/20 15:47 - Joe: I think about that video every time I see an avocado now 😂
27/7/20 15:48 - Lorena: Lindo!! Jaja de verdad I miss you sooo much .. mi voz me delata jjj
27/7/20 15:50 - Lorena: Jajaja los gifs deberian de tener audio para poder ponerlo ahora.. tarrrddde tiritriiritirii 🎶
27/7/20 15:54 - Joe: I totally did not expect you to say it in English. You always send the audio and video in spanish haha which I don’t mind, but it just made today’s audio unexpected
27/7/20 15:55 - Joe: That would be awesome. Until you open the message in a quiet place and.......tarrrrrdddeee 😂
27/7/20 16:03 - Lorena: jaja es verdad.. me lleva mi tiempo... intentaré sorprenderte fin día mas.. pero hoy tenía ganas de enviártelo en los dos idiomas jajaja 🤷
27/7/20 16:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 16:13 - Joe: Haha I appreciate it. I’ll have to send you something too. Maybe later haha
27/7/20 16:35 - Lorena: 🥰 Que tengas un buen comienzo de día!
27/7/20 16:40 - Joe: Thanks 😊 I’m making some coffee now. I have to leave in about 20 minutes. It cold out so I’m wearing sweatpants and a long sleeve shirt haha
27/7/20 16:51 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:05 - Joe: Hahaha
27/7/20 17:05 - Joe: I found my notebook! It fell behind my bed haha so stoked
27/7/20 17:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:08 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:11 - Lorena: Usas mucho la palabra stoked, el traductor lo define mal.. sería como feliz o algo así? Cuál es la diferencia?
27/7/20 17:12 - Lorena: Como emocionado no?
27/7/20 17:13 - Joe: Mmm I guess it’s a mixture of happy and excited.
27/7/20 17:16 - Joe: I do use that word a lot. It’s weird to explain what it means haha
27/7/20 17:17 - Lorena: Si la usas bastante
27/7/20 17:17 - Lorena: Jaja pero quería saber mejor la diferencia el traductor nunca la traduce bien
27/7/20 17:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:23 - Joe: Hahah I’ll just go with the dictionary definition. enthusiastic or exhilarated
27/7/20 17:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:41 - Lorena: Jajaja genial, así aprendo con gif ya no olvidaré que es stoked . Gracias profe
27/7/20 17:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:43 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 17:52 - Joe: Haha gifs are a perfect way to learn emotions 😂

27/7/20 19:31 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 22:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 22:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 22:31 - Joe: Today I’m giving biggie some attention. At least until he farts. Then he has to go hahaha they smell terrible for such a little dog
27/7/20 22:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
27/7/20 22:37 - Joe: Kyle said socks isn’t allowed on the couch. She is so sad and jealous
27/7/20 23:54 - Lorena: Hola, estaba con el maldito curso de 3d y luego cenando con las chicas
27/7/20 23:55 - Lorena: Jajaja te pagan por esto. No está nada mal Joe! Jajaja
27/7/20 23:56 - Lorena: pusimos la misma cara con ese ronquido tremendo que dio jajaja
27/7/20 23:57 - Lorena: Jajajaja Biggie hace un ruido de confort cuando lo acaricias suavemente
27/7/20 23:58 - Lorena: Jajaja ronca y se tira pedos. Que mal jaja pequeño monstruito
27/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajaja dios la mirada de socks, me da muchísima pena... Esta decepcionada jajaja parece que habla
28/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: No te da pena con esa carita? Yo no podría resistirme a eso jajaja
28/7/20 0:06 - Joe: Holaaaa. I hope you at least learned something haha. Was it hard today? Or what?
28/7/20 0:07 - Joe: Yeah today was very smooth haha lots of sitting and doing nothing
28/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Si algo siempre se aprende, pero estábamos cansadas con Sandri.. fue productivo teniendo en cuenta que era tarde y hacía calor .. no es lo mismo ponerse fresca por la mañana a verlo con tiempo
28/7/20 0:08 - Lorena: Ese ejercicio cuando esté acabado te lo enseñaré seguramente
28/7/20 0:09 - Joe: I felt super sorry for socks! But Kyle said she wasn’t allowed on the couch. I tried to give her some attention after to make up for it
28/7/20 0:09 - Lorena: Me alegro!
28/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: Jaja por qué no? Está sucia?
28/7/20 0:10 - Lorena: Biggie está en el sofá.. socks debe estar súper celosa jaja
28/7/20 0:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

28/7/20 0:14 - Joe: I’m jealous of my cousin like socks was jealous of biggie haha but biggie farted and I kicked him off of me. It was smelled so bad

28/7/20 0:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 0:25 - Joe: Haha at least he got to be on the couch for a while. How was dinner? Did you have work today? Was your day good?
28/7/20 0:28 - Lorena: La cena rica, unas patatas fritas con verduras!
28/7/20 0:29 - Lorena: Y no, aún tengo días de vacaciones .. hasta el 3 no vuelvo! 🙅
28/7/20 0:30 - Lorena: Mi día tranquilo, no hice mucho.. descansar en casa.. fui a hacer la compra.. y luego un poco del curso
28/7/20 0:35 - Joe: Mmmm 😋 I just had a chicken sandwich for lunch haha
28/7/20 0:35 - Joe: Oh yeaaah duh. I forgot you had so many days off.
28/7/20 0:37 - Joe: Sounds like a nice day. After work I went by Kyle’s because he wanted to show me something but I left before he convinced me to help him work on the car again haha he’s not getting me to work on it today 😂
28/7/20 0:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 0:42 - Lorena: Jaja trabajas mucho con Kyle en los coches
28/7/20 0:42 - Lorena: Te gusta la mecánica o te aburre? Jjj
28/7/20 0:47 - Joe: Sometimes I get bored but it’s usually fun. But i like it more when it’s my car haha
28/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: lógico!! jj

28/7/20 8:47 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 8:47 - Joe: Haha
28/7/20 8:51 - Lorena: 🤤
28/7/20 8:54 - Lorena: Que taaal?
28/7/20 8:56 - Joe: Gooood. I’m just laying in bed. I took a little nap so I’m not super tired yet. I am kind of hungry. I don’t have any good snacks though 😠
28/7/20 8:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 8:57 - Lorena: JAJAJAJ
28/7/20 8:59 - Lorena: que comerías ahora?
28/7/20 8:59 - Lorena: otra cosa pinocho, decime cual es tu dirección de casa
28/7/20 9:01 - Joe: Hmmm some cheese and crackers sounds good right now haha or some cereal 🥣
28/7/20 9:02 - Joe: My address?? Mmm I don’t think I can give that to you
28/7/20 9:03 - Joe: Just kidding.....it’s 
1170 Turquoise Drive 
Hercules, California 
94547
28/7/20 9:04 - Lorena: tengo todo en casa menos los cereales jaja
28/7/20 9:04 - Lorena: 94547 es el código postal no?
28/7/20 9:05 - Joe: Correct
28/7/20 9:05 - Joe: Ahhh but I love cereal haha cheese and crackers will be fine. I’ll come over and get some from you now
28/7/20 9:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:12 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:19 - Joe: Hahaha wow we’re so far away! I wonder what that picture looked like when I was in Hawaii
28/7/20 9:21 - Joe: I really wish I could just go now. This is the last week of camp so I would’ve been able to go soon but I’m not allowed!
28/7/20 9:22 - Lorena: creo que te la había pasado .. jaja me gustan los mapas asi que seguramente hice una captura en algun momento
28/7/20 9:23 - Lorena: ojalá!!!
28/7/20 9:24 - Joe: Yeaaah you probably did haha the maps are cool. Sometimes I forget how far you are. Super far
28/7/20 9:25 - Lorena: Ayer me llamó una amiga que no hablaba con ella desde hace tiempo, creo que fue en la cuarentena la última vez.. y me preguntó que tal, le conté que seguía hablando con vos y ella dijo como que no podía creer, jaja que era una locura, pero que se alegraba! sin embargo... ella luego me dio su opinión y me dijo que era algo irreal, esa palabra no me gustó nada jajaja
28/7/20 9:26 - Lorena: me dijo algo como.. si esta bien lore, pero cada uno tiene su vida en otro país
28/7/20 9:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:31 - Joe: Hahaha I can do whatever I want 😂
28/7/20 9:32 - Joe: I’m coming to see you. When it opens up it’s the first thing I’m doing. I’m checking the mail everyday for my passport now hahaha
28/7/20 9:34 - Joe: But i can understand her doubt. It would be hard for a lot of people to just up and go to another country. I don’t have much holding me in any particular place really. Especially once summer is over.
28/7/20 9:35 - Lorena: SIEMPRE!
28/7/20 9:35 - Lorena: te dijeron que te envian un mail antes de que llegue a casa?
28/7/20 9:36 - Joe: 🤔 I don’t think so. Maybe.
28/7/20 9:36 - Joe: I don’t remember if they told me that haha
28/7/20 9:38 - Lorena: ya, en realidad cada uno tiene su opinión y lo respeto.. yo pocas veces tengo dudas de algunas cosas, pero en cosas como más raras, por ejemplo.. cuando me fui a costa rica, recuerdo que tenia una oportunidad de un buen trabajo, y una amiga que es arquitecta, me decía.. pero como vas a irte? estas loca!! y como vas a vivir? y tu futuro? sin embargo otras muchas me apoyaron en mi decisión..mi padre un poco igual que ella, sin embargo mi madre, me decia que me vaya ya jaja.. es muy relativo.. al final esa experiencia fue una de las mejores para mi
28/7/20 9:40 - Lorena: cuando esta amiga ayer me dijo eso, que luego lo hablamos y ella cambió de opinión jajaj
28/7/20 9:40 - Lorena: yo al principio...
28/7/20 9:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 9:44 - Joe: Sometimes you just have to do what you feel is right. But also getting the opinion of friends and family can be helpful.
28/7/20 9:44 - Joe: Haha you were able to convince her. I wonder what you told her 😂
28/7/20 9:44 - Joe: Hahaha
28/7/20 9:47 - Lorena: Por supuesto! De todos modos, la gente que me rodea, suele pensar bastante parecido a mi, entonces siempre me apoyan, mis amigas sobre todo.. ellas también quieren la misma vida, no tan convencional
28/7/20 9:52 - Lorena: Le dije que no era fácil y una pregunta como.. entonces por ese pensamiento me tengo que conformar con un chico cualquiera, simplemente por que esta cerca?
28/7/20 9:53 - Lorena: y le dije que hablábamos todos los días y que los dos estábamos dispuestos a vernos en algún momento
28/7/20 9:55 - Joe: I like not so conventional haha my friends were very supportive too. My mom also. I haven’t told my dad yet 😂 but I’m sure he would support me too.
28/7/20 9:56 - Joe: Mmm some people might say, yes Lore you have to settle hahaha but I’m going to say no. I feel the same way. Someone as a joke said I can get a girl close by and I was so offended 😆
28/7/20 9:57 - Joe: If it wasn’t for closed borders and my passport taking forever I would already be there.
28/7/20 10:04 - Lorena: jaja a tu papá supongo que le llamará la atención que sea con alguien que habla español
28/7/20 10:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 10:06 - Lorena: que llegará antes, mi carta o tu pasaporte?
28/7/20 10:06 - Lorena: jajaja me gusta pensar que puedo meter en un sobre jajaja
28/7/20 10:11 - Joe: Haha definitely. I’ll tell him eventually 😂
28/7/20 10:11 - Joe: Hahaha
28/7/20 10:11 - Joe: Probably the letter. Fucking passport is taking forever.
28/7/20 10:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 10:12 - Joe: 😂 😂 hahahaha
28/7/20 10:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 10:21 - Joe: Hahaha
28/7/20 10:23 - Joe: Ok Lore I’m getting sleepy now. Time for me to go to bed. I can’t wait to see you. I know it will be soon. Have a good day, I’ll talk to you soon. Buenas nochessss 😘 😘
28/7/20 10:25 - Lorena: Me too bombón!!! se me ocurrió una idea para meter en la carta, mientras tomo café la prepararé jaja. Un besito, buenas noches para vos!! 💚
28/7/20 16:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 16:18 - Joe: I’m excited to see what it is you’re going to put in the letter now haha
28/7/20 16:19 - Lorena: Jajaj buenos días
28/7/20 16:19 - Lorena: Hice un duro trabajo esta mañana para la carta jaja
28/7/20 16:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 16:21 - Joe: Hahaha
28/7/20 16:21 - Joe: Sweet! Oh I can’t wait hahah
28/7/20 16:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 16:24 - Lorena: Espero poder enviarla mañana!! Creo que la acabaré jaja
28/7/20 16:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 16:29 - Joe: It’s still not finished? This must be a good letter hahah
28/7/20 16:29 - Joe: 😂
28/7/20 16:44 - Lorena: Jajaja empecé a hacer una cosa y al final me llevó más tiempo de lo que pensaba
28/7/20 16:44 - Lorena: Te suena esa situación? Jaja
28/7/20 16:46 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 16:47 - Joe: Hahah it is inevitable that it takes longer than you think 😆 that’s everything in my life right now but especially when I code
28/7/20 16:48 - Joe: Hahaha
28/7/20 17:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 18:03 - Lorena: Esos ojitos con los que me miras 😍 bueno a la cámara jaja
28/7/20 18:03 - Lorena: Tristán Shelby siempre patinando
28/7/20 18:31 - Joe: Haha I wanted to send a video before I had to put on my goggles or my helmet 😂
28/7/20 20:24 - Lorena: Súper lindoo!!
28/7/20 21:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 21:09 - Lorena: 👏👏👏 que bien!!
28/7/20 21:15 - Joe: I’m super cheap about buying skateboards and shoes haha. Everyone is always telling me I need to buy new stuff. But i refuse to spend money 😂
28/7/20 21:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 21:33 - Lorena: Jajaj que rata
28/7/20 21:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
28/7/20 21:36 - Lorena: Rata se dice de manera informal a una persona tacaña jajaja
28/7/20 21:41 - Joe: Hahah I’m just stingy because I’m trying to save for some land and my house 😆
28/7/20 21:54 - Joe: When I was skating all the time I used to buy a board once a week and shoes once a month. It gets expensive fast haha
28/7/20 21:55 - Joe: I’m finally going home now. Or maybe to get lunch somewhere. I’m super hungry.
28/7/20 22:00 - Lorena: Me parece perfecto! Además muchas veces si no es necesario no hay que consumir
28/7/20 22:01 - Lorena: 😱 muchísimo!!
28/7/20 22:02 - Lorena: Bueno sería que patinabas a todas horas
28/7/20 22:03 - Joe: Yeah I was either skating eating or sleeping back then haha. I got sponsored around that time so I didn’t have to buy too much stuff. Luckily I would get help from sponsors haha otherwise I probably would’ve quit. Too expensive
28/7/20 22:04 - Joe: I’m so excited to find some land and build my house. I hope I can start that relatively soon.
28/7/20 22:07 - Lorena: Jajaj si normal, que sponsors tenías, eras famoso rulitos? 😂
28/7/20 22:08 - Lorena: Eso es genial!!! Yo iré a visitarte a donde estés
28/7/20 22:10 - Joe: Hahah definitely not famous. I was sponsored but it wasn’t like I was a professional though haha
28/7/20 22:12 - Joe: I rode for a bunch of different companies over the years. Bones wheels, es shoes, zoo York skateboards, spitfire wheels(after I got off the  bones team), thunder trucks and real skateboards.
28/7/20 22:18 - Joe: You come and visit me and I’m not letting you leave. Just so you know
28/7/20 23:57 - Lorena: Muy bien, tenías varios!
28/7/20 23:59 - Lorena: Jajaja vale, te dejo que me secuestres
29/7/20 0:00 - Lorena: (Solo en un lugar de playa) jajaja
29/7/20 0:04 - Joe: Haha alright sounds good. I’m trying my best to get an island spot.
29/7/20 0:05 - Joe: I need to save money faster haha
29/7/20 0:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 0:33 - Lorena: En Hawaii?
29/7/20 0:33 - Lorena: Que bonita!!
29/7/20 0:42 - Joe: Haha yeah in Hawaii. That’s the first choice for now. So you need to get a visa and come meet me there after I go to you in Spain and have to leave
29/7/20 0:44 - Lorena: Claro! Sería genial conocer Hawaii con vos
29/7/20 0:45 - Lorena: En realidad creo que no debe ser tan difícil para mí, llevo viviendo en España muchos años, de hecho puedo enseñar mi contrato de trabajo y de la casa..
29/7/20 0:53 - Lorena: Que haces?
29/7/20 0:55 - Joe: I was eating but now I’m watching some videos haha
29/7/20 0:56 - Joe: Yeah hopefully it’s not hard for you. It probably wouldn’t be as amazing as you’d imagine it though. It’s expensive to buy land extremely close to the beach. But I’ll be on the island somewhere good
29/7/20 0:56 - Joe: I just want a cozy spot
29/7/20 0:57 - Joe: And my house will be small and probably shitty so don’t get too excited 😆
29/7/20 0:58 - Lorena: Claro!!  Cerca me refiero que no esté a muchos km, como Madrid jaja lo más cercano son 4horas
29/7/20 0:58 - Lorena: No lo creo!! Con todo lo que estás investigando seguramente salga algo lindo y bueno
29/7/20 0:59 - Lorena: Mi respuesta a esto
29/7/20 1:00 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:01 - Joe: Uh yes I like it 🤤
29/7/20 1:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:03 - Joe: But for my house...I will need you to submit some designs to me 😂 I will contract you hahaha
29/7/20 1:06 - Lorena: Dale zoom a la parte que más te guste
29/7/20 1:07 - Lorena: Jaja yo no soy arquitecta, soy interior designer... Pero te ayudaré claro!!
29/7/20 1:07 - Joe: Hahaha you already know I did.
29/7/20 1:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: Jajajajah
29/7/20 1:08 - Lorena: Dónde? Al collar?
29/7/20 1:09 - Joe: Haha I know. I want you to design the interior though. The outside is basically going to be a rectangle haha
29/7/20 1:09 - Joe: Mmmmmm a little lower hahahaha
29/7/20 1:09 - Lorena: Jaja tengo amigas arquitectas que nos pueden ayudar 😜
29/7/20 1:09 - Joe: Ixhesj

29/7/20 1:11 - Lorena: Dónde? 🤷
29/7/20 1:12 - Joe: Mmm hahah your tits 😂
29/7/20 1:12 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:13 - Joe: And your booty in the mirror 😋
29/7/20 1:14 - Joe: You are just super sexy to me Lore. I think you are so attractive. I like when you tease me but I can’t wait until you can tease me in person hdoesbw
29/7/20 1:14 - Joe: Fuck
29/7/20 1:14 - Lorena: Booty que es, culo?
29/7/20 1:14 - Joe: Yes haha
29/7/20 1:14 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/7/20 1:15 - Lorena: Sabes que esto nunca lo mando, verdad?
29/7/20 1:16 - Lorena: No suelo ir provocando a los hombres por fotos jaja, en realidad las fotos son inocentes.. pero a vos me dan ganas de provocarte 🤭🤷
29/7/20 1:17 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:18 - Joe: Hahah I’m just kidding but it seemed like the perfect time for that meme 😂
29/7/20 1:18 - Lorena: Jajaja es bueno si
29/7/20 1:19 - Joe: Yeah everything you send me is innocent enough. But it still tempts me 😂
29/7/20 1:19 - Lorena: Pero no tonto, solo te las mando a vos.. no suelo enviar cosas mías así jaja de verdad!
29/7/20 1:20 - Joe: Hahah I believe you really haha
29/7/20 1:20 - Lorena: Eso está bien, es la intención jajaja
29/7/20 1:20 - Joe: Haha makes me want to ask you for more! Send more photos, more videos! Hahaha I just like to see you
29/7/20 1:21 - Lorena: Trueque!
29/7/20 1:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:23 - Lorena: Jajajajaja Joe!
29/7/20 1:23 - Joe: Hahha I can’t right now 😩 I will send you whatever you want later but send me more 😂
29/7/20 1:23 - Lorena: La cara de ese niño me hace reír
29/7/20 1:23 - Lorena: 😱
29/7/20 1:24 - Lorena: Comiendo y viendo vídeos me dijiste que estabas
29/7/20 1:25 - Lorena: Si no te apetece podés decírmelo 😒
29/7/20 1:25 - Joe: I waaaaas but I’m not anymore. I am in the kitchen now hahaha
29/7/20 1:26 - Joe: I want to!
29/7/20 1:26 - Joe: Lore!!!!
29/7/20 1:26 - Joe: Hahahaha you must believe me 😂 why would I not want to?
29/7/20 1:27 - Joe: I told you the trade though. Send something now and make a request. You know I always fulfill your request haha
29/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: Jaja bueno te creo!
29/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: Pero no, así no

29/7/20 1:28 - Joe: That’s ok I understand haha
29/7/20 1:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:29 - Joe: I have to catch you around the time you’re getting into bed haha
29/7/20 1:29 - Lorena: Nunca lo haces
29/7/20 1:29 - Joe: Hahah
29/7/20 1:29 - Lorena: Jajaja yo siempre
29/7/20 1:30 - Joe: Ugh fuck babe I’m sorry! You are sexy though. All you have to do is send a picture of you fully clothed and you got me 😂
29/7/20 1:30 - Joe: I never know what to send you. I am not sexy like that hahaha
29/7/20 1:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:30 - Joe: 😂 😂
29/7/20 1:31 - Lorena: Si lo sos para mi!
29/7/20 1:32 - Joe: Watch I’ll send a picture of me in an outfit and ask you to zoom in on the part you like...you wouldn’t know where to zoom hahah bad
29/7/20 1:32 - Lorena: No tenés por que empezar con una foto, podes jugar con algo... Para provocarme
29/7/20 1:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:33 - Joe: Haha ok ok I’ll try something. You have been super patient about all that. I really need to try a little harder
29/7/20 1:33 - Lorena: Te estás vendiendo fatal jajaj
29/7/20 1:33 - Lorena: No importa, no importa
29/7/20 1:33 - Joe: Haha suuure
29/7/20 1:34 - Lorena: Si, jaja fui paciente hasta que tenemos que hablarlo ahora 🙈
29/7/20 1:35 - Lorena: Igual no pasa nada, no hace falta que me envíes nada jaja
29/7/20 1:35 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:35 - Joe: Mmm well soon we’ll play some games together. I miss that time with you. It was fun last time haha
29/7/20 1:36 - Lorena: Ahora voy a presionar your buttons
29/7/20 1:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:36 - Joe: Hahaha that’s ok press away
29/7/20 1:37 - Joe: You can’t press them anymore than the campers do all morning 😂
29/7/20 1:37 - Lorena: Jaja okey okey
29/7/20 1:38 - Lorena: Bueno, que tal el clima por ahí Joseph?
29/7/20 1:39 - Joe: Hahaha Joseph!? what the hell!? 😂
29/7/20 1:40 - Joe: Weather is nice here I suppose haha
29/7/20 1:40 - Lorena: Joseph Villavicencio 👴
29/7/20 1:40 - Lorena: Súper interesante!
29/7/20 1:41 - Joe: Lore is just want to lay in bed with you right now ok haha you got me thinking about it cidjwnze fuck the weather haha Ugh
29/7/20 1:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:42 - Joe: Fuck laying in bed I really want to fuck you. You tempt me so much. I’m seriously going to lose it when I see you haha
29/7/20 1:42 - Joe: Hahahahahah
29/7/20 1:42 - Joe: Noooooo
29/7/20 1:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:43 - Lorena: Jajajaja
29/7/20 1:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 1:45 - Lorena: Era mi intención, pero creo que disfrutas más hablando del tiempo jajaja
29/7/20 1:46 - Lorena: Si yo también lo quiero, pero estamos demasiado lejos. Solo podemos jugar mientras tanto ... Hasta que te eche un polvo que te deje sin respiración
29/7/20 1:46 - Lorena: Jajaja
29/7/20 1:47 - Joe: Haha dammit babe
29/7/20 1:48 - Joe: And the frustration grows hahaha fuck I really hope it’s not very much longer before I can see you and touch you. It’s been forever since I’ve touched a human 😂
29/7/20 1:50 - Lorena: Jajaj pues toca a alguien!
29/7/20 1:53 - Joe: Hahah you know what I mean. Like really touch someone. Seriously though, I miss being able to be affectionate. I really like you and at this point if I was with you I would be super affectionate and always wanting to caress you in someway. It’s frustrating that you’re the one I want to touch like that and you’re so far away.
29/7/20 1:59 - Lorena: Jaja okey el tiempo de "romperte las pelotas" "tocarte los cojones" o " push your buttons" finalizó jajaja necesitaba hacerlo
29/7/20 2:01 - Lorena: Ya lo sé, sé que serías super cariñoso... No dudo de ello..
29/7/20 2:03 - Lorena: Parece que soy una ninfómana cuando te digo de jugar, pero nooo jjjaja solo es que quiero estar tiempo con vos. De hecho si tuviese que elegir ahora mismo si me dijesen un polvo con vos o dormir una noche entera, elegiría la segunda
29/7/20 2:04 - Lorena: Y mira que tengo ganas de la primera eh.. pero sería la segunda
29/7/20 2:05 - Joe: Hahah I think the same. I would literally be the happiest person if I could just cuddle with you for a whole night. The first will be great but I just want so badly to hold you
29/7/20 2:06 - Joe: And you don’t even bring up playing very often so I don’t think of you like that when you do haha
29/7/20 2:08 - Joe: Shit....I can feel it in my bones hahaha the frustration 😂
29/7/20 2:12 - Lorena: Sos muy tierno! Ojalá se haga realidad
29/7/20 2:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:15 - Joe: Hahaha
29/7/20 2:15 - Lorena: Eso espero!!! Jaja 🙈
29/7/20 2:16 - Joe: Dammit Lore most of the time I am 100% fine with the distance but times like this jskxhenwi shit. Fuck the distance haha
29/7/20 2:17 - Joe: Aaah whatever. It will be worth it. It’s ok
29/7/20 2:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:18 - Lorena: Ah sí? Solo estás mal con la distancia cuando estás cachondo?
29/7/20 2:18 - Lorena: 😬
29/7/20 2:19 - Joe: Hahaha not like that. I’m not super horny here, just frustrated that I can’t be near you and that I can’t have any contact with you at all
29/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: Aaaaaahhhh
29/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: Jaja menos mal
29/7/20 2:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:20 - Joe: I don’t even know how to describe it ugh.
29/7/20 2:21 - Joe: Like....I literally want to just put my chest against you. It would make the whole feeling go away
29/7/20 2:21 - Lorena: Jaja tranquilo te entiendo, no te sientas presionado
29/7/20 2:22 - Lorena: Ohh que romántico jajaj
29/7/20 2:22 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:22 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:22 - Lorena: 😂😂😂
29/7/20 2:23 - Lorena: Como un bebé en el pecho
29/7/20 2:24 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:25 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:26 - Joe: Do you really think it could be soo much longer? What can we do to get around all this? How do we meet somewhere??? Fuckkkkk
29/7/20 2:27 - Joe: It’s ok never mind. I am going to be patient. I’ll just keep saving for my house and looking for land and eventually I’ll come and steal you away hahah
29/7/20 2:27 - Lorena: Jajaja
29/7/20 2:28 - Lorena: Creo que va a venir una segunda oleada en sept
29/7/20 2:28 - Lorena: Quizá en noviembre? O enero?
29/7/20 2:28 - Lorena: Enero me parece una puta mierda
29/7/20 2:28 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:29 - Lorena: Jajajajaj ese niño me da mucha ternura
29/7/20 2:29 - Lorena: Ni sé si habrá o no una segunda oleada. Puede que sí, aunque igual no cierran todo o por un mes o algo así
29/7/20 2:30 - Joe: Hahaha the boy captures my current emotions perfectly 😂
29/7/20 2:30 - Lorena: Ahora mismo se puede salir de estados unidos?
29/7/20 2:30 - Lorena: De España si pero no a todos los países, cada vez hay más límites
29/7/20 2:31 - Joe: Shit. I think I can leave but other countries are limiting Americans entry because we handle the virus like idiots haha
29/7/20 2:32 - Joe: Well I can leave after my passport arrives. Pretty sure Spain is still not allowing Americans to travel there.
29/7/20 2:33 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:33 - Joe: What does it all mean haha
29/7/20 2:34 - Lorena: Viajes suspendidos
29/7/20 2:34 - Lorena: A Estados Unidos
29/7/20 2:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:35 - Joe: Sjxidnejeisj
29/7/20 2:35 - Lorena: Jajajajaja
29/7/20 2:35 - Joe: Ok deep breath haha that is not great news.
29/7/20 2:36 - Lorena: En realidad hay que esperar fijo hasta la segunda oleada que dicen... Que será en sept
29/7/20 2:36 - Lorena: A partir de eso ya podrías venir .. mejor que pase toda esta mierda.. que tus vacaciones sean con situación de coronavirus y putas mascarillas es una mierda
29/7/20 2:37 - Lorena: Así que bueno, ya estamos más acostumbrados a nuestra nueva diferencia horaria
29/7/20 2:39 - Joe: I’ll wear a mask or even a full hazmat suit...they just need to let me gooo
29/7/20 2:39 - Lorena: Pero tengo muuuuuchas ganas de que puedas estar conmigo, jaja aunque parezca paciente al escribir sobre la situación
29/7/20 2:39 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 2:39 - Lorena: Jajajajajajaj
29/7/20 2:40 - Lorena: Sos gracioso
29/7/20 2:41 - Joe: I just told my boss I probably won’t be here to do programs in the fall but maybe I will be. Aaaaah ok no more thinking about this. It’ll happen soon enough. Ask about the weather again or something haha
29/7/20 6:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 6:04 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 7:15 - Lorena: 😅 dormida . Que bien hay trabajo todo el año entonces
29/7/20 7:17 - Lorena: Socks ya está contenta! 😂 Me recuerda a esto que ví ayer
29/7/20 7:19 - Lorena: https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMRNjVJZXs6eeUZeGbxD87svM_chJB4gjuPlQ0/?igshid=1xhh5pfn9oexz
29/7/20 7:25 - Joe: Aaah didn’t work. Send it on Instagram
29/7/20 7:26 - Joe: Socks was very happy to get some attention for sure
29/7/20 7:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 7:41 - Joe: Hahaha it’s still funny
29/7/20 7:41 - Joe: I should’ve sent it to you
29/7/20 7:50 - Lorena: Como te mira jaja está súper a gusto ahí en tu pecho
29/7/20 7:54 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 7:55 - Joe: Hahaha
29/7/20 7:57 - Joe: I was looking for a plot of land in Hawaii earlier haha the search continues.
29/7/20 7:59 - Joe: Turns out my cousin has an acre of land from my aunt when she passed away and he miiiight be interested in selling me the property. We’ll see.
29/7/20 7:59 - Lorena: Y te gusta la ubicación?
29/7/20 7:59 - Joe: The property doesn’t have electricity or water though so it’d be a off grid type of setup kind of. The electricity poles stop like a block away from the play ahah
29/7/20 8:00 - Lorena: Claro, importante esto!
29/7/20 8:00 - Joe: The location is ok not my favorite but it would be for a price I can’t really refuse haha
29/7/20 8:01 - Lorena: Por cuánto te lo vende? Cuántos m2?
29/7/20 8:02 - Joe: I’m fine with off grid. I would do solar and a catchment tank
29/7/20 8:02 - Joe: I wouldn’t buy it for more than $5,000
Mmm it’s 1 acre. Let me see
29/7/20 8:03 - Joe: 4000 m2??
29/7/20 8:03 - Joe: It’s land only
29/7/20 8:04 - Joe: We’ll actually...there is a shitty shack that would have to be knocked down haha
29/7/20 8:04 - Joe: Well*
29/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Wow buen espacio de terreno
29/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Pero lo compartirías con el?
29/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: 5.000 dol está re bien no?
29/7/20 8:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:05 - Lorena: Cuánto cuesta un terreno ahi de esos metros?
29/7/20 8:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:06 - Lorena: Ay es bonita esa mini casita jaja
29/7/20 8:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:08 - Lorena: Parece súper lindo este entorno, muy tranquilo! Entre la naturaleza, me gusta! 😍
29/7/20 8:10 - Joe: Mmm if I got this from not family maybe $20,000 for the 1 acre in this area. It’s not near Kona, so not as nice but it’s Hawaii haha
29/7/20 8:10 - Lorena: A quién se lo enviabas? Jaja
29/7/20 8:11 - Joe: 😂
29/7/20 8:11 - Joe: To my friend Nate.
29/7/20 8:11 - Lorena: Parece muy lindo, pero hablas a velocidad del rayo
29/7/20 8:12 - Joe: The guy that went to Hawaii with me in my pictures. He was interested in getting property out there and maybe splitting the cost and we could both build our own houses haha
29/7/20 8:12 - Joe: But that’s been my friend since high school. The homie haha
29/7/20 8:12 - Lorena: Que biennnn
29/7/20 8:13 - Lorena: De que lo conoces al chico?
29/7/20 8:13 - Lorena: Ah lo acabo de leer, perdón!
29/7/20 8:13 - Lorena: Eso suena bien dividir el terreno
29/7/20 8:14 - Joe: All good haha I know it probably seems a little weird. But land is expensive and he wanted to go half haha
29/7/20 8:14 - Lorena: Vas a construirla vos?
29/7/20 8:14 - Lorena: Trabajaste alguna vez en construcción?
29/7/20 8:15 - Joe: Oh but now I’m just going to buy this land myself. It’s too small to divide
29/7/20 8:15 - Lorena: Nada raro, si al final cada uno firma por su parte y tienen espacio suficiente
29/7/20 8:15 - Joe: Yeah I want to build my house
29/7/20 8:16 - Lorena: Cuál es pequeña? 4000m2?
29/7/20 8:16 - Joe: No hahah but it doesn’t seem crazy hard. I can work with tools and my hands ok
29/7/20 8:17 - Lorena: Claro! Infórmate bien y pedí ayuda a amigos o familia que sepa algo también
29/7/20 8:17 - Joe: Yeah cause lots of the land is not really useable. Lava rock all over the place
29/7/20 8:18 - Lorena: Ahhhhhh
29/7/20 8:19 - Lorena: Cuánto podés construir ahí en esos m2?
29/7/20 8:20 - Joe: Mmmm I’m not exactly sure. It would definitely be small though.
29/7/20 8:22 - Joe: Like that shack was basically one room
29/7/20 8:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:23 - Joe: Eh you could make something comfortable size but there might not be much yard left. That’s ok though haha.
29/7/20 8:25 - Lorena: Jjj me parece tierna esa construcción también en medio de la nada
29/7/20 8:26 - Lorena: A lo mejor hay algún terreno más pequeño pero que puedas construir más si en un futuro querés
29/7/20 8:27 - Lorena: Aunque si hay mucha diferencia económicamente.. quedate con este
29/7/20 8:28 - Lorena: Se puede construir en este terreno legal? Precio de licencias?
29/7/20 8:29 - Joe: You can get permits and all that or build it illegally. No one really checks on it up there
29/7/20 8:29 - Joe: Lots of “illegal” houses up in that area
29/7/20 8:30 - Joe: But I don’t know the prices for the license 🤷‍♂️
29/7/20 8:30 - Lorena: Aunque la hagas ilegal
29/7/20 8:31 - Lorena: Yo consultaría si se puede construir ahí una vivienda, si ese terreno se acepta
29/7/20 8:32 - Lorena: simplemente por si algo se derriba en unos años, que tu terreno sea posible
29/7/20 8:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:33 - Lorena: Hay casas cercanas? Tenés vecinos?
29/7/20 8:33 - Lorena: A cuánta distancia está del mar? Jaja
29/7/20 8:35 - Joe: There are neighbors but not really visible.
29/7/20 8:36 - Joe: Driving only haha but I’m not sure how close the nearest good spot is. I only know you definitely have to drive cause the land is up this hill a ways
29/7/20 8:37 - Joe: You can drive around the entire island in a few hours so it’s not like any spot is out of reach if you have a car haha
29/7/20 8:37 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:37 - Joe: Would be nice to walk to the beach though. My sister has the best spot for that. But it’s a condo so lots of other people.
29/7/20 8:38 - Joe: Hahaha
29/7/20 8:38 - Lorena: Claro!
29/7/20 8:39 - Lorena: Pero bueno la casa que podés tener en medio de la naturaleza no sería posible en un sitio donde vive hermana
29/7/20 8:39 - Lorena: O si, pero debe salir 4veces más de dinero jaja
29/7/20 8:40 - Lorena: Yo elegiría vivir más apartada , si puedo tener más espacio
29/7/20 8:40 - Lorena: Aunque podés averiguar también más precios por si hay algo que te encaje más
29/7/20 8:41 - Joe: Something with nature in Kona that is private would be stupid expensive haha retirement dreams or something
29/7/20 8:42 - Lorena: Jajaja
29/7/20 8:43 - Joe: Well if I can get it for $5000 I might as well. I can clean it up and sell it for more even if I don’t live on it. But I would like to live on it for a while, make it nice, sell it for more, and move to a bigger property or a nicer one somewhere closer to town
29/7/20 8:45 - Lorena: Haciendo negocios ya jajaja
29/7/20 8:45 - Lorena: 5000 cada uno con Nate? O 2500, por los 2000m2?
29/7/20 8:46 - Joe: Mmm I would probably buy it myself. Me and Nate were looking for bigger land than that. Maybe 2 or 3 acres
29/7/20 8:48 - Joe: Hahah kind of. I just want to own some land 😂 my own little space in the world. With my own little house.
29/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Jjj estoy bromeando
29/7/20 8:48 - Lorena: Me parece genial Joe, me alegro mucho por vos! Se que lo conseguirás!!!
29/7/20 8:49 - Joe: Just come live with me to make it all complete and I’ll be happy
29/7/20 8:49 - Lorena: Luego te veré en vídeos de YouTube jaja cómo esa gente que cuenta como hizo su casa 😂
29/7/20 8:50 - Joe: Hahaha dammit
29/7/20 8:51 - Lorena: Jjjj ojalá! Suena muy bien para mi, como un sueñooo y en Hawaii con voss, algún perro como socks y nuestra cabra! 😂
29/7/20 8:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:54 - Joe: Hahaha yes please. This is what I want
29/7/20 8:55 - Joe: It sucks how slowly things are happening right now. The most exciting events but they’re happening in slow motion. Getting my land. Meeting you. All the good stuff takes too long hahah
29/7/20 8:55 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 8:55 - Joe: 😂
29/7/20 8:57 - Lorena: Jajaja y eso que vos sos un chico paciente
29/7/20 8:57 - Lorena: Hasta el pasaporte y la carta tardarán en llegar
29/7/20 8:59 - Lorena: Yo odio esperar jaja pero luego cuando llega el momento, y puedo conseguirlo.. siento el esfuerzo y lo valoro mucho más
29/7/20 9:00 - Lorena: Si por ejemplo hubieses venido a la semana de conocerte, no lo hubiese valorado tanto ... Ahora a este punto después de una puta pandemia,sin idioma y a tantos putos km, lo valoraré mucho más
29/7/20 9:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
29/7/20 9:01 - Joe: Hahahaha
29/7/20 9:03 - Joe: Haha yeah that’s true. I am going to be so excited when I finally meet you. If it had been right away it would have been fun and an interesting experience but I’ve built up a lot of feelings for you in the time we’ve been talking that will make it much better
29/7/20 9:07 - Lorena: Si bombón! Muero de ganas por verteee!!
29/7/20 9:09 - Lorena: Compartimos tantos momentos a distancia que ahora sos una de las personas que más me interesa, esto es una locura!
29/7/20 9:10 - Lorena: Un abrazo ahora tan DIFÍCIL es?
29/7/20 9:13 - Joe: Hahah I know what you mean
29/7/20 9:14 - Joe: Apparently. The world is conspiring against us here haha
29/7/20 9:15 - Joe: Haha it is a little weird how much I care about you. You could totally just block my number and Instagram and you would be gone. That would make me pretty sad I can’t lie haha
29/7/20 9:17 - Lorena: Eso sería muy crueeel
29/7/20 9:18 - Lorena: No no, eso no pasará!!! Como voy a bloquear a la persona con la que más me divierto hablando por WhatsApp o viendo en vídeos? Estas loquito? Jajaja
29/7/20 9:19 - Lorena: Ni vossss a mi eh! Jaja
29/7/20 9:28 - Lorena: Quiero un videooo jajaj
29/7/20 13:01 - Joe: Sorry babe I fell asleep!
29/7/20 13:02 - Joe: Got up to go to the bathroom but I’m going back to sleep now haha. I will send you a video in the morning 😘
29/7/20 13:03 - Lorena: Siisi lo imaginé! Jaja tranquilo no problem. Volvé a dormir bombón!

30/7/20 1:27 - Joe: We killed the tires too fast! Haha only got a few runs before we had to leave. It’s ok. It was fun. Got to slide the car around a little bit. I need to get my own little beater car to slide around in.
30/7/20 1:52 - Lorena: Jajaj por fin lo pudieron probar!!!!
30/7/20 1:54 - Lorena: Parece divertido, si! Y además Kyle está súper motivado
30/7/20 1:54 - Lorena: Stoked!

30/7/20 2:06 - Joe: Can’t wait to do again
30/7/20 13:17 - Lorena: 👏👏👏
30/7/20 13:24 - Lorena: Se tienen que alejar un poco para poder hacer esos derrapes no?
30/7/20 13:24 - Lorena: Palabra nueva: derrapar
30/7/20 13:24 - Lorena: Tenés que ponerlas en tu cuaderno jj

30/7/20 16:22 - Joe: I woke up so late today. But I start my other skate job after camp today. Just a few hours of work though.
30/7/20 16:26 - Lorena: Buenos días!
30/7/20 16:27 - Lorena: Se tienen que alejar un poco es como irse lejos, para hacer esos derrapes y que sea un espacio abierto y no este la policía no?
30/7/20 16:29 - Lorena: Esto es a 1hr de Madrid!! Fue algo breve, más improvisado pero fue genial. Me encanta dormir en la naturaleza, con el ruido de el agua, los grillos, el aire.. las estrellas!!!
30/7/20 16:29 - Lorena: Muy bien chico trabajador! Te deseo que te vaya muy bien tu trabajo hoy!
30/7/20 16:32 - Joe: Oh yeah. It was far and kind of in the middle of some farm land.
30/7/20 16:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

30/7/20 21:20 - Joe: Haha your hair after the pool looks better than my hair after wearing a helmet all day 😆
30/7/20 21:23 - Lorena: Jajaj buena pareja
30/7/20 21:41 - Lorena: Ya limpia y duchada!!!
30/7/20 21:42 - Lorena: No te preocupes bombón, que te vaya muy bien en el segundo trabajo. Hablame cuando quieras. Te echo de menos yo también. Un besito!
30/7/20 21:43 - Joe: I have just enough time to eat a slice of pizza haha. I start in 20 minutes.
30/7/20 21:43 - Joe: Thanks! Enjoy your evening babe. I’ll talk to you soon 😘
30/7/20 22:24 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
30/7/20 23:23 - Lorena: Sii este parece mucho más divertido para vos jjjj
30/7/20 23:32 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 0:00 - Joe: It’s actually really nice. The kids are already pretty good at skating so we just have fun cruising around. And we skate street not just the park
31/7/20 2:45 - Lorena: Grrr como me acaban de picar los mosquitos como en 4 sitios
31/7/20 2:48 - Joe: Bummer. Your net is not working well?? Don’t get too eaten up out there
31/7/20 2:54 - Lorena: No tengo aún mosquitera en casa
31/7/20 2:55 - Lorena: Que mal humor mira como m picaron los hijos de puta
31/7/20 2:57 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 2:59 - Joe: Damn they got you really good. They look big haha. That sucks. And yeah you look a little bit sleepy but very good as always 😊
31/7/20 3:05 - Joe: I have to say it does look like you’ve been scratching those bites. That’s not helping hahha
31/7/20 3:05 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:05 - Joe: You need some cream for those things
31/7/20 3:06 - Joe: I knew it haha you can tell even in the video you’ve been scratching
31/7/20 3:07 - Lorena: No encuentro la crema
31/7/20 3:07 - Lorena: BxudjzbjckNshdhxhhxh
31/7/20 3:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:10 - Joe: Aw babe I wish I could help you!
31/7/20 3:10 - Joe: Poor thing
31/7/20 3:13 - Lorena: Jaja porfi estaría bien ayuda
31/7/20 3:15 - Joe: I would send you a creme but it would take too long I think haha
31/7/20 3:15 - Lorena: Acabo de ponerme citronella para que no piquen más aunque no encuentro mi crema para evitar rascarme..
31/7/20 3:15 - Lorena: Quiero que estés acá ahora
31/7/20 3:16 - Lorena: Jaja ya no quiero que estés más lejos
31/7/20 3:16 - Joe: Well hopefully they stay away now. That’s the one thing I don’t miss about Hawaii. Mosquitoes. I was constantly battling them haha
31/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:17 - Joe: Hahah I’m getting the first flight I can. Promise
31/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: Jaja yaaa
31/7/20 3:17 - Lorena: Ahora, ya
31/7/20 3:18 - Lorena: En este momento, acá en mi cama, a dormir
31/7/20 3:18 - Joe: Just tell them to let me go and I’ll go haha
31/7/20 3:18 - Joe: Fuck I want that haha
31/7/20 3:19 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:19 - Joe: I’m not even exaggerating when I say I’m coming out there right away when they open up travel haha. I’ll be one of the first people to go. This is bullshit
31/7/20 3:20 - Lorena: Jajajj
31/7/20 3:21 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:21 - Joe: Hahaha
31/7/20 3:22 - Lorena: Ahora me molesta la distancia, de verdad, sería tan fácil si estas acá me dormiría mucho más rápido
31/7/20 3:22 - Lorena: Ahora estoy desvelada por estos mosquitos
31/7/20 3:23 - Joe: Maybe if I was with you they’d bite me instead haha you’d be safe
31/7/20 3:24 - Lorena: Me siento impotente y frustrada 😭😭😭
31/7/20 3:26 - Joe: I’m sorry I’m not there yet 😔 I know the powerless feeling. I get that feeling. That’s how I felt the other day when I really wanted to see you. It sucks but all I can do is be ready to go whenever it’s an option. And I really apologize for making you interested in me somehow even though I’m so far away
31/7/20 3:27 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:28 - Lorena: Es injusto
31/7/20 3:29 - Lorena: 😔😔
31/7/20 3:29 - Lorena: Me atrapaste en tus redes de una manera bestial
31/7/20 3:30 - Joe: I didn’t mean to haha shit I didn’t even know what was going on at first 😂
31/7/20 3:30 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:30 - Lorena: Jajaja
31/7/20 3:32 - Joe: My favorite gif haha totally me. But I agree it’s unfair. I have nothing else stopping me except coronavirus weirdness. I can buy a ticket and tomorrow is the last day of camp. I just want to be next to you
31/7/20 3:33 - Lorena: Jaja sería genial Joe
31/7/20 3:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:33 - Lorena: Gracias por calmarme jaja
31/7/20 3:33 - Lorena: Cuando me pongo así puedo ser un poco insoportable
31/7/20 3:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 3:34 - Lorena: 😭😭😭😭😭 yo quiero
31/7/20 3:34 - Joe: Hahaha you’re just a little cranky but that’s ok. Can’t be happy all the time. The mosquitos are bothering you and I understand that. I’ve been there haha. I’m glad I could help from so far away
31/7/20 3:40 - Lorena: Jaja sí estoy irritada
31/7/20 3:41 - Lorena: Quiero que llegue ya el día
31/7/20 3:43 - Joe: You’re telling me. I don’t know what to do but wait. But I understand this is a hard thing to do and however you’re feeling just let me know.
31/7/20 3:43 - Lorena: Sería tan feliz acá de tenerte ahora jaja, aunque haga calor te abrazaría igual, con brazos y piernas 😁
31/7/20 3:43 - Joe: Haha I want this. Fully wrapped! 😂
31/7/20 3:45 - Lorena: Creo que no podrías salir jaja
31/7/20 3:45 - Lorena: Sacaría toda mi fuerza
31/7/20 3:47 - Joe: It’s ok. I don’t think I would want to get out haha I’m trying with all my energy to get in 😆
31/7/20 5:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 7:13 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 7:21 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 7:29 - Lorena: Ehhhhh
31/7/20 7:29 - Lorena: Bombón!!!!! Por finnn
31/7/20 7:30 - Lorena: No me esperaba para nada que llegue ya!!!!
31/7/20 7:30 - Joe: I’m super stoked!!
31/7/20 7:31 - Lorena: Y yoo
31/7/20 7:31 - Joe: I didn’t expect it to come either. Now once they open travel I’m fucking ready!
31/7/20 7:31 - Lorena: Quiero un vídeo de estooo
31/7/20 7:31 - Lorena: Que buen despertar!!!
31/7/20 7:32 - Lorena: Después de tantos picotazos de mosquitos...algo buenísimo!
31/7/20 7:33 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 7:34 - Lorena: Jajaj
31/7/20 7:34 - Lorena: Que bonito essss
31/7/20 7:35 - Lorena: Con esa águila!!!! 😍
31/7/20 7:36 - Joe: Haha it’s nice looking
31/7/20 7:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 7:38 - Joe: I’m too excited haha but I have to wait for the borders to open or whatever. Almost there though. One step closer.
31/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Me encanta!!
31/7/20 8:04 - Lorena: Yihaaaaa pasaporte por fin!
31/7/20 8:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 16:14 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 21:48 - Lorena: Jjj hola!!!
31/7/20 21:49 - Lorena: Qué tal??
31/7/20 21:57 - Joe: Holaaaa. I’m good. Skating over to the other camp now. Glad to be done with the one at the skatepark for now haha
31/7/20 21:59 - Lorena: Me alegro!!
31/7/20 22:00 - Lorena: Que vaya bien el 2° camp! 🛹
31/7/20 22:06 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 22:06 - Joe: I’m super tired. Ready to go home haha. But good news is I got a new board and shoes
31/7/20 22:10 - Lorena: Cuando te bajas la mascarilla para sonreírme 🤗
31/7/20 22:10 - Lorena: 😍 este quería poner jaja
31/7/20 22:10 - Lorena: Otra tabla más?
31/7/20 22:34 - Joe: Haha well I put together the one my boss gave me. And bought new shoes.
31/7/20 22:43 - Lorena: Como te cuida tu jefe jajaj
31/7/20 22:50 - Joe: Haha he was mad that I wouldn’t buy new stuff. So he just gave me the board 😂 he hates seeing the crappy stuff I ride
31/7/20 22:50 - Lorena: Mirá lo que me dice mi madre que me hizo gracia jaja
31/7/20 22:52 - Lorena: Ella siempre me insiste desde hace tiempo que me compré un libro de inglés para ir repasando, pero yo nunca lo hacía.. al final son un poco caros y me aburren un poco
31/7/20 22:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 22:53 - Lorena: Le conté que ya tenías tú pasaporte está mañana y justo por la tarde le pase esta foto que había comprado un libro y ella me responde... "Lo que hace un pasaporte"
31/7/20 22:54 - Lorena: Jajaja .. se refiere a lo que se consigue con un pasaporte.. y pone su gif preferido
31/7/20 22:54 - Joe: Hahah so are you buying the books? Or too expensive and boring haha?
31/7/20 22:54 - Joe: Oooh hahaha sweet!
31/7/20 22:54 - Joe: That’s funny
31/7/20 22:55 - Lorena: Compré un libro hoy y ella me responde eso por que sabe que lo hice por que hablo con vos jajaj
31/7/20 22:55 - Joe: Oh your mom put the gif? Hahaha I don’t know why I thought you put that. That’s hella funny hahaha
31/7/20 22:56 - Lorena: Ella lleva tiempo diciéndome y yo siempre le decía no.. son aburridos, no me gustan las ilustraciones de niño, blablaba tonterías jaja
31/7/20 22:56 - Joe: Haha niiiice. I really want to get a book. To help guide my learning a little better. I’m all over the place haha
31/7/20 22:56 - Lorena: Jajaja si, ella no sabe cómo buscarlos o no encuentra lo que le gusta entonces se guarda los gif que envió y luego los reenvía a mí hermano y a mí 🤣
31/7/20 22:58 - Lorena: * Envío (sin tilde)
31/7/20 23:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 23:14 - Lorena: Jajaja sii
31/7/20 23:16 - Lorena: Creo que es bonita la carta que te estoy haciendo .. me va a dar pena enviarla jajaja
31/7/20 23:19 - Lorena: Bueno es un sobre normal.. espero que llegue... Pero quería hacerlo con tiempo sin prisas...las chicas siempre están en casa y no tenía intimidad jaja
31/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Ahora estoy con una cerveza acabandolo
31/7/20 23:20 - Joe: Hahah I want to know what is in this letter. What could it beee?
31/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: 😬😬😬😬
31/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Me cuesta callarme
31/7/20 23:20 - Lorena: Jajaja
31/7/20 23:21 - Joe: Hahah Yeah don’t tell me. No spoilers.
31/7/20 23:21 - Joe: I’m terrible at keeping secrets or not telling a something that is supposed to be a surprise hahaa I always want to tell before the time comes
31/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: Jajajaja
31/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: Me muero por contártelo
31/7/20 23:22 - Lorena: En realidad es una tontería, un detalle.. no te imagines que es nada del otro mundo
31/7/20 23:23 - Lorena: Pero sigo con ello en mente haciéndolo jaja y me gustaría mandarte una foto ahora mismo pero no puede ser jaja
31/7/20 23:24 - Lorena: Te estoy guardando unas bragas dentro del sobre
31/7/20 23:24 - Lorena: Jajajaa nahhh mentira
31/7/20 23:26 - Joe: Hahaha send photos!!
31/7/20 23:27 - Joe: But I’ll be happy with whatever I get from you!
31/7/20 23:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
31/7/20 23:36 - Joe: Hahaha I know you weren’t sending the panties. But I’m saying, whatever is actually in the envelope, I’ll be happy with it
31/7/20 23:37 - Lorena: Ah ya jajaj si decía que no voy a enviarte fotos de nada relacionado con el sobre. Quiero enviarlo ya jaja así me cuesta menos contarlo
31/7/20 23:38 - Joe: Haha ok ok. Well let me know when you send it so I can keep an eye out for my letter.
31/7/20 23:41 - Lorena: Vale jajaja te avisaré por si algún familiar la tira a la basura sin querer jajaj
31/7/20 23:51 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 0:30 - Joe: I’m super ready to go home haha so tired.
1/8/20 0:59 - Lorena: Que es ese sitio?
1/8/20 0:59 - Lorena: Jaja una arquitectura como está te gustaría tener dijistes?
1/8/20 1:16 - Joe: That was UC Berkeley. I wanted to show you the architecture
1/8/20 1:21 - Lorena: Ahhh!! Gracias guía turístico de arquitectura jjj
1/8/20 2:00 - Lorena: Bueno rulitoss, hora de dormir para mi. Que tengas buena tardee. Muakk 😘
1/8/20 2:03 - Joe: Oook. I’m getting on the freeway now. Have to sit in traffic 😠 

Sleep well! I’ll talk to you tomorrow
1/8/20 13:03 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 15:46 - Joe: Haha it’s meeee
1/8/20 15:46 - Joe: I need a book like that!
1/8/20 19:15 - Lorena: I miss you Joe, echo de menos hablar con vos 😖
1/8/20 19:16 - Joe: I was just thinking about you. I’m working on that website again. I made the smallest amount of progress haha. This is coming together in slow motion
1/8/20 19:17 - Joe: But I miss you! I’m free all weekend so whenever you have time I’m here to talk
1/8/20 19:17 - Lorena: Que web la de las 1000 palabrss?
1/8/20 19:19 - Lorena: Sii yo también!
1/8/20 19:19 - Joe: Yeah that one. It's taking me forever to figure out how to clean up the data you get from WhatsApp so it'll work every time
1/8/20 19:19 - Joe: But i'm getting closer
1/8/20 19:20 - Lorena: Como que datos?
1/8/20 19:23 - Joe: When you export a chat, WhatsApp gives you a .txt file. My program has to read the chat line by line and figure out who sent the message and separate the message from the contacts name or phone number
1/8/20 19:24 - Joe: But there is stuff like blank lines or lines that don't start with the timestamp and contact name, which makes it harder to sort with code
1/8/20 19:27 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 19:28 - Joe: Hahaha sorry
1/8/20 19:28 - Lorena: Jaja parece interesante aunque no sé bien para que se colocará luego
1/8/20 19:28 - Joe: nerd stuff about sorting the chat file into something usefule haha
1/8/20 19:28 - Joe: useful*
1/8/20 19:30 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 19:36 - Joe: Yeah. The code reads every line and finds the contact name or phone number. Then if that name wasn't found before in the chat, the name or number gets added to a storage, with a list of any messages found for that name connected to the name. If the name is already in the storage, the message gets added to the list connected to that name or number.
1/8/20 19:37 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 19:38 - Joe: This is what one of the lines the computer is reading through looks like..."[4/24/20, 11:49:52 AM] Joe: Haha yeah Kailua is kind of a tourist town but it’s cool and really mellow compared to Honolulu"
1/8/20 19:38 - Lorena: Es broma??? Jajja
1/8/20 19:38 - Lorena: Peor que tres tristes tigres
1/8/20 19:39 - Joe: Hahah it's hard to explain
1/8/20 19:39 - Lorena: Pero esto para que es exactamente?
1/8/20 19:40 - Lorena: Ay no lo entiendo jaja
1/8/20 19:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 19:40 - Joe: Well it's exactly like what i did where i gave you the list of 1000 words
1/8/20 19:40 - Lorena: Por qué no salen 1000 palabras solo con un número de teléfono?!
1/8/20 19:41 - Joe: But trying to make it work for anyone. I cheated when i did it for our chat because i could just search for Joe: and Lore: then organize the chat. Very easy. But now i want it to work for anyone. So i had to write code that could find any name or number in between the timestamp and the : at the beginning of the messages
1/8/20 19:43 - Lorena: Y no puede ser +34637738536:? Jajaj
1/8/20 19:43 - Lorena: Como ese código consigue descifrar que un mensaje de texto pertenece a un número de teléfono?
1/8/20 19:43 - Joe: So i have to take a message like this "[4/24/20, 11:09:37 AM] Joe: The town is called Kailua-Kona" and put it in a Joe bucket. And one like this "[4/24/20, 11:30:11 AM] Lore: Que suerte, estás en el sitio perfecto. Eso de tener la playa tan cerca es un sueño! Ví alguna foto en Google jjj disfrútalo!" and put it in a Lore bucket. But now the code can find any name or number where our names are, automatically create the bucket, then add any messages from that person to there bucket
1/8/20 19:45 - Joe: This is some code that finds any words or numbers in between "] " and ":" which is the name or number of the contact
1/8/20 19:45 - Joe: r"(?<=]\s)[^:\]]+"
1/8/20 19:46 - Joe: it's called a regular expression. Most code doesn't look like that, but that is what i had to figure out to find any contact name or number when the computer reads the line
1/8/20 19:47 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 19:47 - Joe: So it would find your name in here [4/24/20, 11:30:11 AM] Lore:  because it's between "] " and ":"
1/8/20 19:48 - Joe: But replace your name with anything and it will find it. Then sort any messages found in later lines for that name. After everything is sorted, i can split the messages and organize those word by word for the word count.
1/8/20 19:49 - Joe: Ok sorry this probably makes zero sense hahah but i'm getting closer. I need to start thinking of how to present the 1000 words to the user
1/8/20 19:49 - Lorena: Mmmmm
1/8/20 19:50 - Lorena: Si debe tener mucho sentido
1/8/20 19:50 - Lorena: Pero no tengo ni idea como funciona eso de los códigos
1/8/20 19:50 - Lorena: Me refiero no sé la dificultad que lleva pensar en algo para que luego este el resultado en un sitio donde yo navego
1/8/20 19:51 - Lorena: Pero cuando tengas una parte activa y pueda entrar
1/8/20 19:51 - Lorena: Podré hacerme mejor la idea del significado de tus códigos jaja
1/8/20 19:52 - Joe: Oh yeah haha. Ok once I have the bare minimum working I’ll get it online so you can visit the site and give input and understand better what it is supposed to do
1/8/20 19:54 - Lorena: Lo siento, intento entenderlo pero hasta que no lo vea aplicado no sé bien cuál es la diferencia de esas decisiones que tomas jajaja
1/8/20 19:54 - Lorena: Hecho! 😊
1/8/20 19:56 - Joe: It's ok. I figured it would be hard to explain anyway. Maybe by tomorrow night i can have something online
1/8/20 19:57 - Lorena: Okey, gracias por intentarlo igual
1/8/20 19:59 - Joe: Are you doing anything fun this weekend? My friend Paz went to Colorado so no filming this weekend for me. That's why i have plenty of time to work on my project haha
1/8/20 20:01 - Lorena: Hoy me quedo por Madrid, mañana quizá vaya a la sierra
1/8/20 20:02 - Lorena: Bueno, bien podés avanzar en el proyecto y descansar para cuando puedan grabar algo el finde que viene
1/8/20 20:04 - Joe: Yeah hopefully they’re back by next weekend. I didn’t ask when they’re coming back haha. I’m going to need a second cup of coffee today. And a good lunch.
1/8/20 20:05 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 20:09 - Lorena: Pero se fue a grabar a colorado con amigos o de vacaciones?
1/8/20 20:10 - Lorena: Jajaj plantitas
1/8/20 20:13 - Lorena: Quiero saber, sos bueno en bricolaje? Haciendo muebles o arreglando cosas, maderas, hierros, o no te atrae mucho?
1/8/20 20:14 - Joe: He went with another friend of mine that also skates and films. They asked me to go but i couldn't because they left on Wednesday and i had to work
1/8/20 20:15 - Joe: I like it. I don't do it super often but it's fun. Otherwise i wouldn't have saved these corks haha. Last thing i made was probably that table with my sister though.
1/8/20 20:16 - Lorena: Ohhh bueno luego podrás hacer viajes si ya no trabajas en el skatepark
1/8/20 20:17 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/8/20 20:18 - Lorena: La palabra en español es "manitas" cuando una persona se da maña en temas del hogar, como instalaciones, carpinteria, pintura, restauración, etc..
1/8/20 20:20 - Lorena: Cuando yo vendo un mueble a un cliente y está desmontado, le pregunto, "sos manitas? " O..  " si sos un poco manitas, no hace falta que contrates un servicio de montaje, es fácil"  se dice manitas por manos
1/8/20 20:21 - Joe: Hahah i'll add manitas to my notebook. So glad i found that thing
1/8/20 20:22 - Lorena: Jjj manitas se dice para hombre o para mujer
1/8/20 20:22 - Joe: Well than are you a "manitas" or no?
1/8/20 20:23 - Lorena: Yo si soy manitas jajaj
1/8/20 20:24 - Lorena: Hay veces que lo hago yo, pintó cosas o lijo.. y con algo que no puedo le digo a mi padre jaja o cuando trabajaba en el taller, mandaba al chico a hacer las cosas que yo no podía jaja
1/8/20 20:30 - Joe: Hahah well that's good. At least you do what you can. I figured you would say yes to being a manitas but i had to double check.
1/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: Si, me considero manitas. Me gusta hacer cosas con las manos
1/8/20 22:03 - Joe: Ahhh i thought i was almost done but i hit another wall. I need to eat some lunch before i can figure this out. Damn i was so excited too, i was on a roll for a second haha
1/8/20 22:09 - Lorena: Jajaj cómo, que hiciste?
1/8/20 22:16 - Joe: I'm just having a hard time removing words that are not supposed to be in the list. Like if you export the data without images or audio files WhatsApp puts "omitted" in place of the message so i have to remove that word and "/200emessages" also is showing up in the messages for some reason. It's supposed to be easy to remove those but what i tried didn't work
1/8/20 22:16 - Joe: But i'm pretty sure it should've worked hahah i must be doing some small detail wrong
1/8/20 22:27 - Lorena: Jajaja
1/8/20 22:28 - Lorena: Encima con nuestra conversación te deben salir muchos omitidos, hay mil audios, archivos, foros, gif, dos idiomas
1/8/20 22:44 - Joe: Yeah this is getting complicated haha it's been good practice though. I'm brushing up on some stuff i knew and learning some new stuff too
1/8/20 23:20 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
1/8/20 23:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

1/8/20 23:54 - Lorena: Salís tan lindo rulitos! Que me dan ganas de ir corriendo para ahí jaja
1/8/20 23:58 - Joe: I need to give you a better video or something. Maybe my camera is broken. No way you can be looking at me. I’m not cute hahahah

2/8/20 0:04 - Lorena: 😬
2/8/20 0:04 - Lorena: Que tenías pensado hacer hoy?
2/8/20 0:05 - Joe: Do this code, clean, skate
2/8/20 0:10 - Joe: But now I just want to take a nap. I guess I could take a short nap in a little bit and still do everything. Maybe no skating but that’s ok. I should just read a book or something haha
2/8/20 0:40 - Lorena: Jjj bueno, te queda todo el día!
2/8/20 0:41 - Lorena: Mi día ya terminó, noche.. hora de dormir!!
2/8/20 0:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>

2/8/20 0:47 - Lorena: Jsjaja todo bien
2/8/20 0:48 - Lorena: 1975 veces dije que 😯
2/8/20 0:48 - Lorena: Pero sale omitted
2/8/20 0:49 - Joe: Haha yeah i still have to solve that problem but i got something working for now. I'll work out the details over time.
2/8/20 0:50 - Joe: Once this is ready we can upload a fresh chat log and see where we're at with word usage
2/8/20 0:51 - Lorena: Genial, me alegro que te haya salido nerd!!!
2/8/20 0:51 - Lorena: Cuál es tu palabra más repetida?
2/8/20 0:51 - Joe: "i" hahhah
2/8/20 0:52 - Joe: so apparently i talk about myself a lot 😂
2/8/20 0:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 0:52 - Joe: i	2557

2/8/20 0:52 - Joe: hahaha
2/8/20 0:52 - Joe: dammit
2/8/20 0:53 - Lorena: Jajaj bueno es que el yo en español se omite mucho
2/8/20 0:54 - Lorena: Muchas veces, me ganas!!
2/8/20 0:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 0:55 - Lorena: Si habrá que pensar algo en diseño jaja, ya me dirás que tenés en mente con un boceto o algo jefe jajaja
2/8/20 0:56 - Joe: Haha alright i'll let you know. I'm thinking some simple tables or something. I don't know. Still got to get it working right.
2/8/20 17:08 - Joe: Holaaaa. I hoe you’re having a good day. Did you do to the mountains?
2/8/20 17:38 - Lorena: Eeeeeuuu
2/8/20 17:38 - Lorena: Hola siiii sierraaaa
2/8/20 17:44 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 17:50 - Lorena: Graciasssss
2/8/20 17:50 - Lorena: Espero que vos también
2/8/20 17:52 - Joe: I’m just starting my day. I woke up later than usual. Making some coffee and some bacon then I’m going to do some coding.
2/8/20 19:13 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 19:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 19:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 19:33 - Joe: Going to the same place? You love going into nature with your friends out there haha. I want to join you!!
2/8/20 19:49 - Lorena: Sii el mismo! Jaja
2/8/20 19:49 - Lorena: La verdad es que dejamos de ir a bares, en verano con buen tiempo es una pena no estar en la naturaleza, nos llevamos nuestra neverita y música
2/8/20 19:50 - Lorena: Que pena que no puedas estar acá para unirte, te lo hubieses pasado bien, con porris y teníamos flotador.. 😅 aunque no un pegasus jajaj
2/8/20 19:55 - Joe: Haha my friends and I don’t go to bars much either. But we also don’t have cool trips to nature as often as you either. Too much skating.
2/8/20 19:56 - Joe: Hahah that Pegasus was hilarious.  So big. Socks ended up biting it and putting a hole in it.
2/8/20 20:22 - Lorena: Jajaja me encanta socks necesito que venga a España ella también
2/8/20 20:23 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 20:29 - Joe: Haha I wish she could come with me everywhere. And she was very satisfied after killing the Pegasus. She initially but it to pull me back to shore. She wanted to save me haha
2/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: Jajajj Kyle cuidando su Pegasus y cargando con el todo el viaje y socks contenta pinchandolo jaja
2/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 20:40 - Joe: Holy shit haha you are super red!
2/8/20 20:40 - Joe: Ouch
2/8/20 20:41 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 20:41 - Lorena: Jajaja 😬😬
2/8/20 20:41 - Lorena: 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
2/8/20 20:42 - Joe: I can’t believe how red you are haha how long were you out there!?
2/8/20 20:42 - Joe: You need a bigger hat haha
2/8/20 20:42 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 20:43 - Lorena: Jajaja si me olvidé de ponerme crema en esa zona.. solo piernas.. estaba entretenida con mis amigas
2/8/20 20:44 - Lorena: Por suerte la cara no me la quemé estaba con mi sombrero de dora jajaj
2/8/20 20:48 - Joe: Always the cutest haha the hair is looking great
2/8/20 20:49 - Joe: Whoops 😬 At least you had the Dora hat haha I've been trying to remember to put sunscreen more often but i still forget all the time. Plus i hate to put it on my face, if i sweat it gets in my eyes haha
2/8/20 20:57 - Lorena: Jjjj ☺️💛
2/8/20 20:59 - Lorena: Jajaja yo te digo a vos que te lo pongas pero luego yo me olvido 🙈
2/8/20 20:59 - Lorena: Me alegro que te lo pongas, aunque sea molesto cuando sudas ...
2/8/20 21:00 - Lorena: Dios me arde la espalda, necesito que alguien me pase aftersun de aloe 🥵
2/8/20 21:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 21:03 - Joe: Yeah it looks like you could use some. Looks like you could use a lot actually haha you need to take a bath in aloe 😂
2/8/20 21:15 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 21:16 - Lorena: Te has achicharrado es una expresión que se dice en España.. es como asada.. como la comida jjjjj
2/8/20 21:20 - Joe: Hahah it definitely applies to you. At first i thought maybe the screen on my phone was making it look redder than it was but i looked on the computer and you are still very red 😂
2/8/20 21:28 - Lorena: Jajaja ahora sí estamos al mismo nivel que cunado llegaste a Cali
2/8/20 21:28 - Lorena: Que tal tu día, seguís codificando?
2/8/20 21:34 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 22:52 - Lorena: Eo estaba cenandoo
2/8/20 22:54 - Lorena: Cada vez se va viendo más ordenado, estás más cerca de conseguir esas tablitas
2/8/20 23:07 - Joe: I can see why it’s messing up now. There is a line that has picked up a word that isn’t a word...it’s like 60 commas so it makes the first cell of the table get super wide
2/8/20 23:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
2/8/20 23:19 - Joe: I really don't understand why the words i want to take out aren't being taken out either. Like omitted. I'm using pretty much the same code i used to make the list i gave you of our chat. Those didn't have these problems. It's weird
3/8/20 0:07 - Lorena: Jajja ese suspiro de complicación, pobre Joe
3/8/20 0:08 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 0:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 0:11 - Lorena: Solucionado lo de los apostrofes? Y eso de los colores?
3/8/20 0:15 - Joe: Haha Yeah i solved the apostrophes and also the words like omitted have been taken out, but only in english haha. Later I'll make a setting so the user can create their own list of words to not to be included. Colors are the new problem.
3/8/20 0:17 - Lorena: Dioss
3/8/20 0:18 - Lorena: Dammit! Como dirías vos
3/8/20 0:20 - Lorena: Bien esos arreglos, espero que encuentres solución rápido a eso jjj
3/8/20 0:21 - Lorena: Cuál es tu idea de la web? Publicarla en algún sitio?
3/8/20 0:23 - Joe: Yeah i'm going to put it online. Probably no one will use it but that doesn't really matter to me haha
3/8/20 0:24 - Lorena: Por qué tan pesimista?
3/8/20 0:24 - Joe: I'm trying to put it online now but it is taking forever
3/8/20 0:25 - Joe: Haha because it is a pretty useless tool i think?
3/8/20 0:25 - Lorena: Depende como lo enfoques
3/8/20 0:26 - Lorena: Es un proyecto en el que estás trabajando
3/8/20 0:26 - Lorena: Y dedicando gran parte de tu tiempo
3/8/20 0:26 - Lorena: Ya que lo estás haciendo, hay que pensar como puede ser realmente útil
3/8/20 0:29 - Joe: I'm just thinking how it can be useful to me. Like, if you wanted to analyze our chat, this would be the tool to use instead of having to write the code yourself. So it could be useful, but i don't think many people are looking to analyze their whatsapp chats is all i'm saying haha
3/8/20 0:30 - Lorena: Si eso me parece genial
3/8/20 0:32 - Lorena: Pero habías dicho que lo querías para portfolio también ... Y los desarrolladores web sus portfolios tienen como accesos directos a las webs no? si potencias un poco el proyecto y definís un público al que pueda interesarle esto, habrá gente que entre y puedas trabajar en ello y afinar más
3/8/20 0:34 - Lorena: No sé es sólo una idea, en línea hay mil cosas .. podés mirar algún video de esos de YouTube de las 1.000palabras, igual algo aparece que te hace pensar que a la gente le puede parecer útil
3/8/20 0:35 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 0:36 - Joe: Haha yeah you’re right. Hopefully I can make some more progress soon. I’m going to take a break for now. I’m not getting anywhere right now. If I get it online I’ll send a link and you can try it out haha
3/8/20 0:40 - Lorena: Claro, tomate un descanso para verlo más claro luego
3/8/20 0:41 - Lorena: De todos modos ahora recién estás iniciando, a lo mejor te surge una idea luego.. de todos modos será divertido para nosotros ☺️ y poder analizarlo, independientemente que luego no te sirva para otra cosa
3/8/20 0:42 - Lorena: Puede ser que esté mezclando los idiomas? Creo que hay palabras en inglés en mi lista que yo no dije y vos en español que tampoco... O igual si... No sé jaja
3/8/20 0:43 - Joe: I’m going to make a smoothie and watch a show or something. I don’t know yet. But definitely break time haha
3/8/20 0:43 - Joe: Yeah I’ll come up with something. You’re right I just started it. It has a long way to go
3/8/20 0:44 - Lorena: Mmm 😋
3/8/20 0:44 - Joe: Mmmm I’m pretty sure I’m not mixing them up. I’ll have to find someway to double check that
3/8/20 0:44 - Joe: But later haha
3/8/20 0:45 - Lorena: Sii, aprenderás algo seguro y nosotros podremos aprovecharlo. Así que gracias!!
3/8/20 0:45 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 0:52 - Joe: I don't know what to watch haha maybe i'll just put on random YouTube videos
3/8/20 0:53 - Lorena: Nowness
3/8/20 0:59 - Joe: Haha ok I’ll check that out
3/8/20 1:01 - Lorena: Bueno, disfrutá de tu descanso y del resto del día! Yo me voy a dormir, buenas noches..un besito! 😘
3/8/20 1:05 - Joe: Sleep tight babe. I'll have something online by tonight so you can test it out tomorrow haha, i'll send the link later. Buenas nochesss 😘😘

3/8/20 7:14 - Lorena: Muy bien bombón!!!! Good job!
3/8/20 7:16 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 7:17 - Lorena: Muchísima, mira el cursor al lateral derecho ja!!
3/8/20 7:25 - Lorena: Cargué la conversación en txt dos veces pero cuando le doy a upload desaparece, "no file" y solo lee máximo 7 veces
3/8/20 7:29 - Joe: Hmmm maybe it doesn’t work good on mobile or something? I only tried on the computer
3/8/20 7:30 - Lorena: Que raro, por qué? Si al final hace el recuento
3/8/20 7:30 - Joe: I don’t know why it isn’t working for you.
3/8/20 7:31 - Joe: Shit
3/8/20 7:31 - Lorena: Bueno, lo probaré cuando tenga un ordenador cerca 😊
3/8/20 7:32 - Joe: Haha yeah our conversation is super long now 😂
3/8/20 7:32 - Joe: Yeah I guess just do that and let me know how it goes when you get a chance
3/8/20 12:23 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 12:29 - Lorena: Ehhh bombón, que linda luna quiero estar ahí
3/8/20 14:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 14:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 14:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 14:20 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 15:45 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
3/8/20 15:50 - Lorena: Creo que no debería haberla enviado
3/8/20 15:51 - Joe: Haha why do you say that?
3/8/20 15:52 - Lorena: Quién es Marije?
3/8/20 15:53 - Joe: I don’t know haha they just followed me and I followed them back. If it makes you uncomfortable I can unfollow her cause I honestly don’t even know who it is.
3/8/20 15:54 - Lorena: Hace lo que quieras
3/8/20 15:54 - Lorena: Espero que esa carta de pierda
3/8/20 15:54 - Joe: Daaaaaang Lore
3/8/20 15:59 - Joe: Wow I don’t know what to say. There was nothing but a follow on social media. I’m sorry if that upset you and I already unfollowed and removed her as a follower. Ugh I don’t want to make you feel like I know you do right now. I’m really sorry I’ll just give you some time. I don’t know what else I can do
3/8/20 16:04 - Lorena: Envié hace unas horas la carta, con ilusión e hiciste que me sienta como una estúpida
3/8/20 16:05 - Lorena: Hay personas que te siguen y vos no las sigues, y esta chica .. no es de ahí ... Y vos devolviste eso, para hablar, tontear, jugar o lo que sea...
3/8/20 16:06 - Joe: Dude seriously you are all I want. I’ve been talking to you for months, I’ve been saving and planning to come see you. Finally got a passport. Learning Spanish. Like you are all I want!
3/8/20 16:06 - Lorena: Me da igual ya que la sigas o no, el acto ya está hecho.. podés agregarla y hablar lo que quieras ya
3/8/20 16:07 - Joe: Dude i follow back lots of people but I never talk to anyone
3/8/20 16:07 - Lorena: No lo parece agregando a una desconocida a Instagram.. encima de esas que se hacen selfies y mil mierdas puaj.. 😷
3/8/20 16:08 - Joe: Ugh
3/8/20 16:11 - Joe: Fuck I really don’t know what to do at this point. I’m just really sorry. All I know is I wasn’t trying to do anything like talk to her or whatever you’re thinking.
3/8/20 16:13 - Joe: If you don’t see my Instagram later it’s because I’m going to deactivate it. I don’t need shit like this in my life. I don’t even care about random people. Think whatever you want and we can talk later if you don’t hate me.
3/8/20 16:37 - Lorena: Yo no estoy diciendo que te tengas que quitar Instagram, o que no puedas hablar o tener chicas.. no soy tan radical ni mucho menos.. pero justo después de enviarte una carta que llevo días preparando, ver ese tipo de gesto por tu parte.. ese tipo de chica en tu Ig. cuando normalmente lo usas para skate y poco más.. obviamente voy a imaginar que es para otras cosas..
3/8/20 16:39 - Joe: I understand
3/8/20 16:40 - Lorena: Puede que no lo hayas hecho de gusto, pero los dos sabemos con que intención le diste a seguir, pero está bien.. yo por mi parte, solo puedo decirte que me molestó y por eso te lo dije
3/8/20 16:42 - Joe: I can see why it bothered you and I apologize. I know you don’t care either way but I already deactivated IG. I’m really bummed I upset you right after you spent so much time on the letter. You’re all I want.
3/8/20 16:42 - Joe: Fuck
3/8/20 16:50 - Joe: I’m so sad about this. I really feel like I fucked shit up. I’m going to go out for a walk or something. I’m sorry again
3/8/20 16:54 - Lorena: No tenés por qué desactivarlo, es algo tuyo y podés usarlo todo lo que quieras, ver skate, memes, tus amigos, e incluso tus nuevas amigas
3/8/20 16:56 - Lorena: Si, yo también...gracias...te deseo que tengas un buen día 😉
4/8/20 20:12 - Lorena: Hola Joe, hablamos?
4/8/20 20:15 - Joe: Of course. I just wasn’t sure if you would be in the mood to talk
4/8/20 20:19 - Lorena: Bueno.. es que no quiero que estemos así
4/8/20 20:22 - Joe: I don’t know, I feel like you see me differently and I don’t know how to do anything about it
4/8/20 20:22 - Joe: But I just want you, that’s still the same for me
4/8/20 20:23 - Lorena: Como que te veo diferente?
4/8/20 20:25 - Lorena: Bueno yo primero que todo quiero disculparme, estuve unos días sensible.. y siento que a lo mejor lo pagué un poco con vos y fui un poco radical con mi actitud
4/8/20 20:28 - Lorena: La realidad fue lo que te dije, estaba preparándote la carta muy concentrada con eso pensando que te haría ilusión, y de repente vi una chica que no tiene pinta de ser amiga, y me molestó bastante pq me imaginé algo que no quería de vos
4/8/20 20:31 - Joe: I mean it was probably a frustrating feeling. I understood you being mad. I’m still bummed I made you feel that way especially right when you are going through extra effort to send me something.
4/8/20 20:33 - Joe: At least now I know a little bit about how you get when you’re mad. I wish there was more ways for me to make things better but all we can really do is talk.
4/8/20 20:35 - Joe: I was definitely thinking about you a lot last night and this morning. I don’t want to mess things up with you
4/8/20 20:40 - Lorena: Si, pero vos también hacés esfuerzos en cosas por mi o para los dos, como todo el tiempo que dedicas a las palabras o cuando intentas aprender español, etc y yo no soy una santa tampoco ni me recriminas nada..
4/8/20 20:42 - Lorena: Yo no siempre mando una carta a un chico, y no sé.. me entró como un impulso de "rabia" y "celos"
4/8/20 20:43 - Lorena: Rabia por ver ese gesto, que es una tontería realmente pero yo le encontré significado.. no dudo en lo que sentís por mi, ni me arrepiento de haberte enviado la carta
4/8/20 20:44 - Lorena: Yo también, por eso decidí escribirte.. aunque pensé que no lo haría jaja
4/8/20 20:46 - Joe: You were like the girl that points at her eyes in the meme
4/8/20 20:47 - Joe: There is a lot going through my head haha
4/8/20 20:48 - Joe: But I’m still excited to get the letter and you won’t see any more stupid gestures from me. I’m sorry again
4/8/20 20:50 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/8/20 20:51 - Lorena: Decimelas
4/8/20 20:57 - Joe: Hahah I don’t know. Just how I react to you being mad and how you are when you are upset, and what things upset you
4/8/20 21:16 - Lorena: Parece que estás ocupado, ya hablamos cuando puedas ☺️
4/8/20 21:17 - Joe: Haha whaaat you’re busy
4/8/20 21:18 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/8/20 21:19 - Lorena: Si hablé yo más
4/8/20 21:23 - Joe: I mean I guess overall I’m glad you didn’t stay super mad for a long time haha
4/8/20 21:25 - Joe: Haha also when I said I had a lot going through my head it’s like I’m thinking a lot but don’t know what to say
4/8/20 21:28 - Lorena: Yaaa pero quiero saber que pensabass
4/8/20 21:28 - Lorena: Que estoy loca o algo de eso? 🙈 Jaja
4/8/20 21:31 - Joe: Haha not that you’re crazy. Thinking about the level of the reaction haha Sometimes I think it was a little much. It I also understand you being mad and maybe it was compounded by the efforts you were putting in that day.
4/8/20 21:34 - Lorena: Bueno vale está bien
4/8/20 21:36 - Joe: But also I wonder what you would’ve been like if you had me face to face haha
4/8/20 21:37 - Lorena: Jaja no sé
4/8/20 21:39 - Lorena: Pero la verdad tendría que haber mirado mejor ese perfil, era bastante fea
4/8/20 21:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
4/8/20 21:43 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
4/8/20 22:01 - Joe: Well in other news I got some private lessons lined up this week and the mom that wanted me to tutor her son also messaged me. I was worried I wouldn’t have enough work in the next few weeks but it’s coming together
4/8/20 22:10 - Lorena: Que bien, cuánto me alegro!!!
4/8/20 22:15 - Joe: Me too haha I was worried I would have to find a job that would lock me in here more than just doing lessons and tutoring. I still have to get paid haha.
4/8/20 22:40 - Lorena: Es el trabajo perfecto!!!
4/8/20 22:40 - Lorena: Por cierto del chico ese supiste algo más?
4/8/20 22:45 - Joe: The boy I’ll be tutoring? I don’t know much at all haha just that I’m supposed to help him with school work and try to keep him interested
4/8/20 22:46 - Lorena: Ah jaja no decía ese
4/8/20 22:47 - Lorena: Ya empezaste con eso?
4/8/20 22:47 - Lorena: Decía el chico se codificación
4/8/20 22:50 - Joe: No I haven’t started yet. Just got the message today asking if I was still interested in doing the tutoring
4/8/20 22:51 - Joe: Not sure I understand but I don’t think there will be any coding with the little boy.

5/8/20 1:10 - Joe: Oh and my mom doesn’t speak Spanish either
5/8/20 1:12 - Lorena: Valee, entiendo
5/8/20 1:12 - Lorena: Y tu hermanos hablan español?

7/8/20 23:49 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
8/8/20 0:01 - Joe: Crap! Hahaha alright shit. I’ll check it out. I think I know the problem. The file has spaces in it and I have to change those to “_”

8/8/20 8:32 - Lorena: Si, Madrid en verano es horrible. En la sierra nunca pasé este calor.. jaja 🥵
8/8/20 8:32 - Lorena: Estas contento con lo que grabaste? Esta buena la toma!! 🤟
8/8/20 8:33 - Joe: Sounds like it’s too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter haha
8/8/20 8:35 - Joe: Eh mostly. I don’t like how my toe looks like it touched the ground on the one trick but other than that it was good. Not perfect, but nothing i film is perfect so it’s to be expected haha
8/8/20 8:37 - Lorena: Cuándo?
8/8/20 8:38 - Lorena: 0.15 seg? O cuando decís?
8/8/20 9:54 - Lorena: Perdón estaba media dormida, no sé cuándo decís que no te gusta

9/8/20 2:49 - Lorena: Jaja no pasa nada
9/8/20 2:50 - Lorena: Tengo una duda, que significa cuando ponés siempre bad!? Que significado además de "malo" tiene
9/8/20 2:50 - Joe: I was so bummed when I couldn’t find Paz earlier haha. He was at a skate spot and left his phone in the car. I drove all the way out there and couldn’t find him haha
9/8/20 2:51 - Joe: Oh hahah yeah. “My bad” is like saying “sorry” or “my fault”
9/8/20 2:52 - Lorena: Ohhh no!!
9/8/20 2:52 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
9/8/20 2:53 - Lorena: Que penaaa
9/8/20 2:53 - Joe: Well sometimes I’m using it as bad like “malo”. But when I say “my bad” it’s like an apology
9/8/20 2:54 - Lorena: Genial, gracias profee
9/8/20 2:58 - Joe: Anytime haha. How was your day? Did you enjoy your beer? Why are you so far? Hahaha
9/8/20 10:14 - Lorena: Bombón me había quedado dormida, ni 4 minutos duré despierta. Mi día de ayer bien, fue el cumpleaños de Sandri, así que desayuné con ella, luego me fui a trabajar y cuando volví fuimos a un bar a tomar unas cervezas con un amigo suyo y nada ahora me acabo de despertar 😴
9/8/20 10:15 - Lorena: Sii disfruté de las cervezas en la terraza 😋

9/8/20 19:02 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>

9/8/20 20:29 - Lorena: Que liiiiindo!
9/8/20 20:31 - Lorena: Me alegro que te hayas divertido rulitos
9/8/20 20:34 - Joe: Thanks 😊 i guess I should go skate or something soon. What have you been up to today? I could’ve used you in the car earlier, I needed a DJ haha it was hard to control the music while driving those roads
9/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: Vas a grabar con Paz hoy?
9/8/20 20:36 - Lorena: Yo estuve por la mañana en casa con Sandri, luego trabajé por la tarde y acabo de salir
9/8/20 20:37 - Lorena: Jaja sí, poniendo música o pasándote comida o algo de eso. Me hubiese gustado hoy un plan así de viaje juntos jaja

9/8/20 21:03 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
9/8/20 22:11 - Joe: Soooo i'm still not sure if i fixed the problem on my website. I don't think i did though 🤬
9/8/20 22:40 - Lorena: Ahora en un rato que haces?
9/8/20 22:42 - Joe: Well I was working on the website but now I’m just waiting for Paz to tell me where they’re going to skate so I can meet them there
9/8/20 22:43 - Lorena: Ahhh muy bien!

10/8/20 22:33 - Lorena: Jajaj que haces en una hora o así?
10/8/20 22:34 - Lorena: Quería ya estar tranquila y hablar un poco con vos pero como una amiga de Sandra y tengo que estar un ratito
10/8/20 22:35 - Lorena: 👆☺️
10/8/20 22:37 - Joe: Mmm I don’t know haha but I shouldn’t be too busy or anything so hit me up whenever
11/8/20 0:16 - Lorena: Perdón se alargó la cosa jaja

11/8/20 0:21 - Joe: No problem. I’m ok. Just ate some lunch and I’m super full haha
11/8/20 0:21 - Lorena: Que comiste?
11/8/20 0:23 - Joe: A tuna sandwich and some chips.
11/8/20 0:23 - Joe: But it probably should’ve been two tuna sandwiches haha there was a lot of tuna
11/8/20 0:23 - Joe: What are you doing?
11/8/20 0:24 - Lorena: Jaja bien, lo único que no me gusta de comida es el atún
11/8/20 0:24 - Lorena: Sé que a todo el mundo le gusta...
11/8/20 0:24 - Joe: Ok noted. I won’t make you anything with tuna ever haha
11/8/20 0:29 - Lorena: Jajaja no porfi. Igual fresco creo que puede gustarme un poco más pero de lata, odio ese olor. Mi hermano siempre se hacía cosas con atún y era como 🤢
11/8/20 0:29 - Lorena: Pero me encanta toda la comida!
11/8/20 0:29 - Lorena: Hay algo que no te guste?
11/8/20 0:30 - Joe: Hmmm it’s hard to think off the top of my head of something I don’t like.
11/8/20 0:30 - Joe: Oysters haha I don’t really like those
11/8/20 0:31 - Joe: Aaah just add a little lemon 🍋 and it smells fine haha
11/8/20 0:32 - Joe: The smell isn’t the best. I agree
11/8/20 0:33 - Lorena: Jaja a mí tampoco ahora que lo pienso
11/8/20 0:34 - Lorena: Que locura, estoy rodeada de gente que va a tener hijos
11/8/20 0:35 - Lorena: Una amiga de Sandra acaba de venir y está embarazada y una amiga de Argentina que estuvimos en Costa Rica, me acaba de decir que esta embarazada .. con un amigo pero de hace unos meses
11/8/20 0:35 - Lorena: 👶 por todas partes!
11/8/20 0:38 - Joe: Hahah babies everywhere
11/8/20 0:38 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 0:39 - Joe: I just have the two irresponsible friends with kids so far. I wouldn’t be surprised if a few others started popping out babies soon though haha
11/8/20 0:41 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 0:53 - Joe: Haha why this one?
11/8/20 0:58 - Lorena: Jaja no sé
11/8/20 0:59 - Lorena: Cosas mías que pienso sobre tener un bebé o cosas de esas
11/8/20 16:58 - Joe: Holaaaa. Sorry I’ve been a little quiet. I’m feeling like a sad boy haha

I don’t know how to describe how I feel except to say I’m feeling a little down. Not even sure why honestly.
11/8/20 17:27 - Lorena: Holaa estaba en una siesta, juju
11/8/20 17:29 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 17:29 - Lorena: Eyy por qué??
11/8/20 17:31 - Lorena: Bueno me acabas de decir que no sabes cómo describirlo, pero me gustaría saber un poco aunque sea
11/8/20 17:32 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 17:33 - Joe: Mmm I’ll have to think about it. I really am not sure. Maybe I just feel stuck or something
11/8/20 17:34 - Lorena: Conmigo? 😬
11/8/20 17:34 - Joe: Haha more like without you
11/8/20 17:37 - Joe: Maybe I just need to be more productive or something. Code more, skate more. Stay busy. I’m not really sure.
11/8/20 17:39 - Lorena: Estas incómodo con algo relacionado conmigo?
11/8/20 17:40 - Joe: No no it’s not you
11/8/20 17:41 - Joe: I can’t 100% explain why I feel this way. Just feeling a little less enthusiastic than usual.
11/8/20 17:42 - Lorena: Si, hay épocas que si no sentís que haces cosas.. estás cómo un poco bajón.. a mí me pasó alguna vez.. por qué no encuentras realmente sentirte útil.. aunque como dije creo que es por épocas, ya que en Hawaii no hacías demasiado.. y puede que la rutina de California te haga sentir un poco así, no sé
11/8/20 17:45 - Lorena: Estoy opinando un poco sin saber exactamente..solo por ayudarte
11/8/20 17:47 - Joe: Haha it’s ok. If I knew exactly why I was feeling this way I would do something about it. It feels similar to when I really want to see you and feel powerless with that feeling in my gut. But this time it’s not about not being able to see you, it feels more like just about being able to make things happen in life in general
11/8/20 17:47 - Joe: I don’t know 🤷‍♂️
11/8/20 17:48 - Joe: It doesn’t matter anyways. I feel like this from time to time. Just a little touch of sadness isn’t the worst thing in the world
11/8/20 17:49 - Lorena: No pasa nada bombón
11/8/20 17:50 - Lorena: Me alegra que me lo cuentes, ojalá pudiese ayudarte o darte simplemente por un abrazo
11/8/20 17:50 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 17:50 - Lorena: *un.. ( por no)
11/8/20 17:50 - Lorena: Jjjjj chiquito...
11/8/20 17:52 - Lorena: Creo que puede ser el ritmo de la sociedad también, los cambios, cosas nuevas, te mudaste hace relativamente poco.. y tampoco sabes que pasará realmente en el mundo
11/8/20 17:52 - Lorena: Mmm no me hagas mucho caso, igual no es eso
11/8/20 17:53 - Joe: Eh that could be a part of it for sure. Who knows haha 🤷‍♂️
11/8/20 17:54 - Joe: If it wasn’t so cold I would go skate or something. Maybe I should work on some websites
11/8/20 17:55 - Joe: Good news is I got another 2 kids to give lessons to. All these lessons are good and fun but I also want to find a job coding. I’m still bummed on that dude not coming through with that one job.
11/8/20 17:55 - Joe: Aaah whatever it’s fine. Life goes on.
11/8/20 17:56 - Joe: I wish I could get a job like that soon though. I want to continue to put money away to get a property and build a little house.
11/8/20 17:56 - Lorena: Me alegro mucho por esos dos nuevos niños!! El tema del trabajo es algo muy emocional ..
11/8/20 17:56 - Joe: It feels like it’ll take forever sometimes. Like I’m going to build my house and die the day it’s done cause i took too long hahaha
11/8/20 17:59 - Lorena: Se que te ilusionaste con ese trabajo de codificación, es algo lógico...y fue una mala experiencia como se comportó ese chico... Pero no pierdas la ilusión, hay más trabajos.. y seguramente seas súper apto para ello
11/8/20 18:00 - Lorena: El skate está bien, es divertido, y te hace ganar dinero. Podés compaginarlo con la profesión que querés.. podés apuntarte a algún curso de codificación, si estás un poco desmotivado, o hacer algún proyecto que te interese para portfolio
11/8/20 18:01 - Lorena: Jajaja.. sos super joven! Pasarán cosas antes de eso seguramente.. disfrutalas todas!
11/8/20 18:01 - Joe: Yeah fuck that guy haha
11/8/20 18:02 - Joe: True. Maybe I’ll take a course or something. I have some projects I want to start also. I wish I had like one friend who also knew how to code. It would make some of my ideas much more doable haha
11/8/20 18:03 - Lorena: Te lo digo por que a mí aveces me pasa, que pierdo la motivación con algo de diseño, pero intento hacer cursos..a mí en 3D me ayuda tener a Sandra...pero estuve tiempo que no tenía a nadie y  hay veces que no era tan productiva
11/8/20 18:04 - Joe: Haha yeah I know. I just have doubts sometimes. It’s crazy how expensive it can be just to get your own place on the earth. And the longer I take the more expensive it gets haha. I know I’ll get there but it’s a snails pace
11/8/20 18:06 - Lorena: Lo sé yo también pienso en ello todo el tiempo, pero yo por ejemplo no encontré mi lugar, vos si sabes dónde querés vivir
11/8/20 18:07 - Lorena: Tarde o temprano lo conseguirás, simplemente seguí guardando ese dinero y construirás algo cuando puedas
11/8/20 18:08 - Lorena: No hay prisa. No tenés responsabilidades, no tenés hijos, no estás en la calle, tenés una casa donde dormir que es la de tus padres, o la de tu hermana en Hawaii..
11/8/20 18:09 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:10 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:11 - Joe: Hahahah
11/8/20 18:11 - Joe: You’re right babe. One day. Sooner or later.
11/8/20 18:12 - Lorena: Jajaja
11/8/20 18:13 - Lorena: Estoy entre medias de tus planes a Hawaii
11/8/20 18:14 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:14 - Joe: Hahaha that’s fine with me
11/8/20 18:15 - Lorena: Si querés construir tu casa antes, podés hacerlo sin tener que venir a verme que es más complicado igual para tu estado de ánimo actual jaja
11/8/20 18:16 - Joe: Uuuuh no
11/8/20 18:17 - Joe: I’ll build my house without coming to see you if you meet me in Hawaii and build it with me instead haha but then I’m keeping you
11/8/20 18:17 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:24 - Lorena: Me encantaría, pero no quiero ser lo que "estropee" o este en medio de tu objetivo final qué es lo que realmente te hace feliz y querés hacerlo cuanto antes
11/8/20 18:26 - Joe: Eh I have time. I want to do it soon but I also want to see you. I’d be very happy to be spending a rainy day indoors with you right now
11/8/20 18:28 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:29 - Lorena: Este día fue genial, lo necesitaba tanto! Un poco de frío.. lluvia.. agua.. últimamente el calor me estaba irritando.. jjj
11/8/20 18:31 - Lorena: Buah sería geniaaal, soy buena dando "cosquillas" tipo mimo... Podría darte unas en la cara para que estés triste, y desarmarte un poco los rulitos
11/8/20 18:34 - Joe: Yeah I don’t remember many times you talking about it being cold there but you complain about the heat often haha glad you got some relief
11/8/20 18:35 - Joe: That would be nice. I probably wouldn’t even feel this way if I was with you. Stop being so far. Thanks
11/8/20 18:39 - Lorena: Es que nunca había sufrido tanto este calor.. jaja siempre tuve aire acondicionado o viví en la sierra .. pero la ubicación de esta casa donde estamos es dura jaja aunque en invierno es genial, estoy solo con un jersey y calcetines finos
11/8/20 18:40 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 18:45 - Joe: That’s rough. At least you have your fan. It’s cold here today also. I want to go skate but I hate skating when it’s cold haha
11/8/20 18:45 - Joe: Haha sweeet
11/8/20 18:46 - Lorena: Si lo odias no vayas, hace otra cosa!
11/8/20 18:48 - Lorena: Creo que socks puede ser buena para que la veas hoy .. fumar un poquito con Kyle.. o  incluso ir al cine o algo de eso.. diferente jaja
11/8/20 18:53 - Joe: You’re right. Kyle is at work but I’ll just watch a movie or show. Relax for a little bit without stressing
11/8/20 19:18 - Lorena: Okey, disfrutaaa!
11/8/20 19:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 19:18 - Lorena: Hablamos luego si te apetece ☺️😘
11/8/20 19:21 - Joe: Good luck. I went on the computer to watch something and started coding instead. I want that WhatsApp chat analysis website to work
11/8/20 19:24 - Joe: Oh also, I don't know if you have an Amazon account or an Amazon Alexa but if you could review the Alexa skill that i made that would be rad hahah https://www.amazon.com/Hone-Thrasher-video/dp/B07RLBPR8F
11/8/20 19:25 - Joe: You don't need to leave an actual review but 5 stars would help haha
11/8/20 21:48 - Joe: I went skating. I feel a little better. I think I need to start skating or exercising in the morning like how are used to go on my morning skate in Hawaii. Moving around makes me feel good
11/8/20 22:13 - Lorena: Ey, acabo de terminar con el puto 3D
11/8/20 22:14 - Lorena: jaja hicimos una entrega de un ejercicio y no sé que le parecerá al profesor.. lo hicimos libre.. para poder ponerlo en un futuro en nuestro portfolio jajaja vamos.. que nos pareció una mierda el que ponían ellos para practicar
11/8/20 22:14 - Lorena: Tengo Amazon si, pero no sé que es Alexa
11/8/20 22:18 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 22:19 - Joe: Hmmm I don’t know. But thanks for trying haha
11/8/20 22:19 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 22:19 - Lorena: Quiero intentarlo
11/8/20 22:20 - Joe: I wonder what the minimum eligibility to write a review is
11/8/20 22:31 - Lorena: Que rabia, no sé por que no me deja.. debe ser por el país?
11/8/20 22:32 - Lorena: puse direccion de estados unidos, pero mi cuenta es de españa ...mmm no sé! lo siento.. si se me ocurre algo intentaré comentar!
11/8/20 22:32 - Joe: Hahah don’t worry about it. Yeah it probably has to do with the country or something like that. Thank you for trying
11/8/20 22:32 - Lorena: me alegro que te sientas mejor, hacer ejercicio por la mañana, salir a caminar, o skate, o algo puede ser una buena opción para sentirte más util por la mañana
11/8/20 22:34 - Joe: Yeah I have to get up and get the blood pumping in the morning haha. Can’t stay in bed too long
11/8/20 22:34 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
11/8/20 22:34 - Lorena: 🤭🤭🤭 claro, claro!!! jajaja
11/8/20 22:36 - Joe: Aaah shit
11/8/20 23:25 - Lorena: https://www.facebook.com/504809206684609/posts/943817462783779/?sfnsn=scwshwa&extid=Zmrgav0YadGK4EZD&d=w&vh=e
11/8/20 23:40 - Joe: Hahah it’s a horse for babies
11/8/20 23:40 - Joe: And yeah I probably wouldn’t trust a girl that didn’t like animals like that haha
11/8/20 23:55 - Lorena: Bueno que? Me contás algo? estoy libre 🦘
12/8/20 0:03 - Joe: What do you meaaan?
12/8/20 0:05 - Joe: What do you want me to tell you? I’m just going to the grocery store really quick. You’re free from what?
12/8/20 0:08 - Lorena: Libre para hablar un rato
12/8/20 0:09 - Lorena: Pero si tenés cosas que hacer no pasa nada
12/8/20 0:09 - Joe: Oh haha
12/8/20 0:09 - Joe: No I’m just waiting in line to pay for my stuff
12/8/20 0:12 - Joe: Sorry if I wasn’t talking much before I was at my friend Fav’s apartment talking to him about random shit haha
12/8/20 0:13 - Lorena: No pasa nada, yo estuve con el curso y luego cenando con Sandra
12/8/20 0:13 - Lorena: Que tal con Fav?
12/8/20 0:14 - Lorena: Te pudo dar buenos consejos? Jaja
12/8/20 0:16 - Joe: Haha yeah he is a smart dude that I’ve known a long time so I can get advice from him. We were just talking about the craziness happening here in America and about how I want to go see you haha
12/8/20 0:27 - Lorena: El también es del skate?
12/8/20 0:28 - Lorena: Jajaj que opina Fav de esto??
12/8/20 0:30 - Joe: Yeah another one of my “Benal” friends that I’ve known since I was like 12 haha
12/8/20 0:30 - Joe: He was stoked for me. He said he wants to go too 😂
12/8/20 0:31 - Lorena: Ohh, buenos amigos!
12/8/20 0:31 - Lorena: Jajaj el también puede venir, lo invito
12/8/20 0:33 - Joe: The friends I hang out with the most are the same ones I’ve had for a long time haha I’ve known all the Benal dudes since I was little
12/8/20 0:34 - Joe: Haha careful, he might actually show up with me 😂
12/8/20 0:37 - Lorena: Jaja no sé nada de Fav pero si es tu amigo será buen chico
12/8/20 0:37 - Lorena: Ya le habías hablado de lo nuestro?
12/8/20 0:39 - Joe: He is alright haha much more extroverted than I am but I need that from my friends
12/8/20 0:40 - Joe: Yeah I told him about you when I was in Hawaii. I haven’t said much to him about you since then so he was a little surprised to hear I’m still talking to you after so long. Especially with the language barrier and everything haha but like I said, he is stoked for me
12/8/20 0:45 - Lorena: Me gustaría saber hasta qué punto sos introvertido, no creo que tanto jaja
12/8/20 0:46 - Lorena: me alegro mucho que piense así, me cae bien entonces jajajj, si algunas amigas con las que hablo de vez en cuando...también se sorprenden ..
12/8/20 0:47 - Joe: Mmm it depends on the situation. And just cause I’m introverted doesn’t mean I’m socially awkward or anything. But I’m definitely less likely to go up to people I don’t know or start talking to random people than some of my friends
12/8/20 0:48 - Lorena: Claro, entiendo!
12/8/20 0:48 - Joe: Cool. I just like having a few really good friends that I know well and they know me well instead of a lot of friends that I don’t really know at all
12/8/20 0:53 - Joe: I’m still bummed my website isn’t working for you haha I have no idea what’s happening 😂
12/8/20 0:53 - Joe: Fuck
12/8/20 0:54 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 0:56 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 0:56 - Joe: I can’t even find a good gif to represent my frustration haha
12/8/20 0:57 - Lorena: Jaja tengo que probarlo desde el ordenador! Últimamente lo uso solo para Netflix ( empecé a ver Ozark) y con el 3D
12/8/20 0:57 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 0:57 - Lorena: La última vez lo probé con Sandra desde nuestros teléfonos
12/8/20 0:58 - Lorena: Este es el más gracioso jajaj
12/8/20 0:58 - Joe: Yeah no rush you can try it tomorrow or whenever. I just wish I knew why it wasn’t working haha. I need to fix it.
12/8/20 0:59 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 0:59 - Joe: Oh yeah I did. Forgot to tell you. Do you like it?
12/8/20 0:59 - Joe: It’s not great but it felt too plain before to me
12/8/20 1:01 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 1:02 - Joe: Hahaha I should’ve known. Thank you babe
12/8/20 1:02 - Lorena: Jaja dejar más espacio en laterales .. no tan a ras el margen
12/8/20 1:03 - Lorena: Y abajo un poco más arriba el título y las dos pestañas, más centradas en dos filas
12/8/20 1:05 - Lorena: 3 steps espacio abajo o más grande y texto centrado
12/8/20 1:05 - Joe: Alright sounds good. This is on mobile right?
12/8/20 1:05 - Lorena: Sii desde mi teléfono
12/8/20 1:06 - Joe: Haha ok for sure. I’ll make the changes in a little bit. Hopefully it already looks good on the computer for you haha
12/8/20 1:06 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 1:06 - Joe: Aaah what?? What was the file type you tried? It should take a zip or txt
12/8/20 1:06 - Joe: Dammit haha that sucks
12/8/20 1:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 1:07 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 1:07 - Lorena: Txt
12/8/20 1:07 - Joe: Shit
12/8/20 1:09 - Joe: Damn I don’t get any error messages on my side so I can’t tell what’s happening 😡
12/8/20 1:10 - Lorena: Jajaja
12/8/20 1:10 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 1:11 - Joe: Haha it’s so dumb. I don’t understand how it can work on my phone and my computer but not for you. Shiiiiit
12/8/20 1:11 - Joe: 😂 😂 😂
12/8/20 1:12 - Lorena: Mmm no sé, desde el teléfono no nos funciona, las dos tenemos android
12/8/20 1:12 - Lorena: Y mañana mientras esté desayunando miraré en el ordenador y te diré
12/8/20 1:13 - Joe: Yeah i need a way to test android phones. It's just weird though cause it shouldn't matter what device you're on when it comes to a website like this. You just upload the file and everything happens on some servers off the phone or computer or whatever device
12/8/20 1:14 - Joe: No worries try it whenever. It probably won't work for you anyway for some strange reason haha makes me look like i don't know what the hell i'm doing
12/8/20 1:16 - Lorena: Jaja no te preocupes
12/8/20 1:17 - Lorena: Puedo imaginar que es difícil, hacer todo la primera vez y que salga bien no es la realidad... Así que ánimo... Ya saldrá!
12/8/20 1:17 - Lorena: ☺️
12/8/20 1:32 - Joe: I made one change that i'm hoping helps. It's basically a change to how the files are stored. It's cool, you're right, it'll get there eventually.
12/8/20 1:33 - Joe: Seems to be working slightly better haha such small changes. I swear if this fixes it....it'd be pretty funny
12/8/20 5:57 - Lorena: aaaah super sleepy, lo siento me quedé dormida
12/8/20 5:57 - Lorena: 🙌
12/8/20 6:00 - Lorena: Vení a dormir conmigo Joe
12/8/20 6:07 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 17:29 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 17:30 - Joe: I have a skate lesson this morning at 10. 2 new kids.
12/8/20 17:44 - Lorena: Buenos días belleza californiana! Como amaneciste?
12/8/20 17:53 - Joe: Feeling good today I guess haha. Ready to get these lessons done. A little bummed on my skatepark job because they aren’t giving me any hours to monitor the park but it’s whatever. Just need to get more lessons to make up for it
12/8/20 18:08 - Lorena: Bueno dos chicos nuevos dan más dinero que monitorear el parque no?
12/8/20 18:09 - Lorena: Además tu jefe te dio trabajo para la web no?
12/8/20 18:23 - Joe: Yeah I get more for doing the lessons than monitoring the park but doing both would be nice. It all adds up
12/8/20 18:23 - Joe: Yes but that is the boss of the skateboard organization I just got hired for
12/8/20 20:30 - Lorena: Estoy de acuerdo!
12/8/20 20:31 - Lorena: Pero bueno, ya te avisará para la siguiente semana quizás. Podés dedicar tiempo a hacer webs y cosas de esas jjj
12/8/20 20:51 - Joe: Haha yeah it’s fine. I have enough lessons and stuff that I don’t really need the hours. I would just like to have them so I can stack money faster haha I’m being impatient.
12/8/20 20:53 - Lorena: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 20:54 - Joe: Hahaha shit
12/8/20 20:55 - Joe: I really just want to build this car with Kyle and it’ll cost a couple thousand to get it where we want it to be. We’re turning one of the cars into a team car haha
12/8/20 20:56 - Lorena: no entiendo
12/8/20 20:56 - Lorena: te vas a gastar miles de euros para hacer que con los coches?
12/8/20 20:56 - Lorena: dolares
12/8/20 20:58 - Joe: <Multimedia omitido>
12/8/20 20:58 - Joe: Yes? 😬
12/8/20 20:58 - Lorena: como descargo una conversación desde Whatsapp Web?
12/8/20 20:59 - Joe: Mmm I downloaded it on my phone and sent the file to myself through email haha
12/8/20 20:59 - Lorena: Jajaj nos reímos a la vez e hicimos el mismo gesto ohh
12/8/20 20:59 - Lorena: Maldita socks que envidia le tengo jajaja
